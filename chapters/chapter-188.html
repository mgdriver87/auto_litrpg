<p class="cnMwZGM5NTY5NjMxNDQ3YWRhNGM3YjI4MmNlM2NkMzA3" data-original-margin="">The dense mana barrier this beast has created is shrinking every time it lets out a shockwave, and it's getting a bit too tight for comfort.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTUwZGM5NDU4MzQ3Nzg5ZjU0MmZkMGNlYmMzNmM5" data-original-margin="">I'm sitting at just over half health, with a 100-meter-wide dome closing in, and a vicious building-sided monster somewhere in the vicinity but entirely invisible to me.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWRlZjUwMThlNTRjYTNiYzFhMGY5MzMyN2EwMDAy" data-original-margin="">I can hear its roar, heavy breathing, and movements from a distance, but the monster is fast and smart. With this limited visibility, it silences its movements when necessary and slips in and out of my range of perception.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTdjZTUzNDQ4YjQ5OWRhYjAxMzU0N2RjMDZjYTBh" data-original-margin="">I need to keep my guard up at all times, this fight just got a whole lot more serious.</p>

<p class="cnNmYjYzNzAxZjY3ODQ3NjU5NjcwZjdlYjQwYjIzYTNl" data-original-margin="">They silently drift through the red mist as I begin air-stepping around, bobbing and weaving through the rubble-covered battlefield.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDllMmE5ZDJhNzRiOWU5MWUxYmY3YTZjY2JmNWRk" data-original-margin="">I can feel the stone floor beneath my feet ripple and bend. Before now, I would try flying into the sky to get away from its radar system, but the thick fog-filled air is no different than the floor.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDY1NGY0MTY5OTQ1MzI4MGJmODhjOWQ2MTM1MjQz" data-original-margin="">It knows exactly where I am, and there's nothing to do about it.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGI5ZTRhZWJlYjQwOTM4MmNlODU3ZDk0NmZmZjAx" data-original-margin="">I grit my teeth, continuing to launch energy attacks into the heavy fog with only the sounds of a fast-approaching monster as my guide to aim each strike.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzdkMzM0YmFjYTRlNzg5Y2FmMTUwZWYzYzQxZmI1" data-original-margin="">I know the crescents of wind and fire I'm launching are not strong enough to injure this beast, but I need to continue burning through mana to appease the Strengthening Fragment while simultaneously pinpointing this monster's exact location.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzI0YTA4NGEyNzQzNjZiN2UwYWJlNjk1ODllZDBk" data-original-margin="">Just over 2000MP is enough to spark a dim glow of white light on collision. The buzzing sound of mana being released on impact gives me just enough visual and auditory cues to ready my next strike.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmQxNmEzZWZhMjQzYzY4MzEwZDNjYzdhYTAzZGNh" data-original-margin="">It's near, and coming in hot.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDU0ZGM1NTU0NzRmNjI5NGI5NjU0NTE1Y2Y2YjA2" data-original-margin="">I stop my attacks after throwing half a dozen from each blade as I see the white signals of impact come closer and closer.</p>

<p class="cnNmNTM4MGE4MWIxNzRhNjliMDJhNDI1NTdhMmMzMmMy" data-original-margin="">I charge up both weapons and plant my feet, looking up into the red fog while squinting, using my perception skill to attempt to look through it with all my might.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWM2NmM1ZGE2ODQzMDFhNzIzZmI1YWNjMDMxNWEz" data-original-margin="">White, red, gold, and black aura grow around my body brighter and brighter as my breathing slows and all I can hear is my own heart beating in my chest.</p>

<p class="cnM3MjU1ZTUxYmRlZTQwMzNiNTZjNmU4YWRhNDE2ODcw" data-original-margin="">The Behemoth lets out a roar, breaking through the fog and swinging its right bladed-arm downward at me.</p>
<p class="cnNjOWYyNzliMWI3ZjRmZDdiOGEyZjhhOTEwM2U5Nzgw" data-original-margin="">With less than a second to think, I watch the glossy stone blade approach me from above as I Dunegon Walk away, positioning myself right over the beast's head.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWEzZDc4OWVmMDQ0YzVhMTk1ODAyNTQ5ZTk5MzZl" data-original-margin="">I look down at the long white horn that juts out from its stone armor. My eyes dart back and forth until I lock onto a small portion of armor that's opened up just below its extended shoulder.</p>
<p class="cnNkOThhNWQxZmEzNDRjMWNiMDJjODJlNThjNmU5M2Qx" data-original-margin="">This is only possible because of its downward strike meant to attack me.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmU5ZGQzOTM5NDQ5NzBiYmNjNGExYzEyZmU0ZTll" data-original-margin="">I smirk, bringing both of my weapons across my body and letting out a yell and two 2350MP crescents of mana.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTU2YmQ4NTJlNTQ0YWRhMzQ2MDE1YzVkMDg1ZWJm" data-original-margin="">The white and black attacks soar through the fog, gliding downward without making a sound.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTE5YWE3YmU0MDRjMGM5M2QyZTJlYjk4ZjlkMDFl" data-original-margin="">The beast continues to lunge forward. It disappears into the fog along with the attacks I threw as the visibility gets even worse. I air-step backward as a ball of flames erupts into my field of view followed by the roar of an injured beast.</p>
<p class="cnMyYWI3NDlkMTk4ZDRjNDQ4YzliMWY0YjZhYzg4NjFh" data-original-margin="">I watch the red mana cloud around me waver, then another shock wave rattles me to the core. I</p>

<p class="cnNlYWIxZTE5NjIyOTRkNDU4NmQ0OTIxYWIwZjRiNWE3" data-original-margin="">My eyes open wide as I see the glossy blade of a flaming Behemoth lunging out from the fiery explosion below without a moment's notice.</p>
<p class="cnM5NmYyNzhhMTJlNjQzZWVhNTFhNDNhZTZjMzMyNGNk" data-original-margin="">Its shoulder's armor is cracked and broken. I can see two large gashes in its flesh, but the monster isn't concerned with it in the slightest.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzM0YWY2MDBiMzRiODdhNjg3MGMwNzBkODUxMmE5" data-original-margin="">It's focused on me...</p>
<p class="cnM4NWJiZGQzYmMyZDRjOTZhZTJmMmNkYWRkMzQ2ZjEw" data-original-margin="">I'm falling from the sky, attempting to gain my composure from the last shockwave of mana and watching the glossy blade of its flaming injured arm come right at me.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDhjOTAzZGM0YTQ5ZTM4Njc4ZjgxMGQzNWY3ZTBj" data-original-margin="">I can barely see 5 meters ahead, but I know I'm in trouble... and there's not much I can do.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDhhMWMyMzRlOTQ0MzZhZmUyNGI5MWUxNGY5Yjc2" data-original-margin="">Its stone blade gets closer and closer as I burst into flames and activate my Dunegon Walker skill less than a meter before impact.</p>
<p class="cnNmM2U5ODBjNDdlMTQ2OWVhYmEyYTA4NTAxOWVkYzc5" data-original-margin="">Letting out a yell, I hit the hard floor below after blindly teleporting to the ground. I begin launching attacks in all directions once again.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTM2MjQxNWNlODQ4MGY5MmQxZTllYTE3MDU1NGRi" data-original-margin="">All I see is red fog... and all I can feel is empty space all around me...</p>
<p class="cnM1NDFkNzU5MTMwNjQ4OTlhODdiNWVhMTUyMWQ1MDJj" data-original-margin="">The ground ripples and flows and the mist that fills the air intrudes my lungs with a murderous presence. The buzzing sound of mana fills the air and clouds my brain more and more every second that passes.</p>

<p class="cnM3MWI0N2U1NDA5MjRiMjU5YzljZTk4NDVmNDRjMTE2" data-original-margin="">I've injured the Behemoth again, but it's not slowing down at all. I don't think I've even touched 20% of its HP.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzU5MjY3N2JlOTRiZWE4Y2MyZmU2MmJjNzhiZGU5" data-original-margin="">The dome goes silent.</p>

<p class="cnMxNDBjNTAzOWVhNTQzYmZiYTQzMmExMWZkM2E2ZDNl" data-original-margin="">Nothing hits. My white and black blades just glide through the red mist and disappear into nothingness before me.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzA5ZTYyNzcyZTRkN2M5M2YwNzk0OTlhMTBlZTU2" data-original-margin="">I check my health bar, and gulp as I see it nearing 1/4. I grab a C-Class-graded HP potion from my item storage and drink it without a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p class="cnMwMWU0M2Y1MTQwMDQ3ODdhZDJiYTUxZDExNzM2NzRh" data-original-margin="">I feel my body rejuvenate instantly, but that doesn't help my current situation as much as I'd hoped. This monster is still invisible to me, lurking nearby.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTAwODAyZWRjOTQ1ODI5ZDY0ZWU4MGVmOWY2N2Ix" data-original-margin="">I continue air-stepping around the rubble, letting out 2000MP attacks in the hope of catching a glimpse of a small white glow, but have no luck...</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2NjM2FkZWM4MjQ3MzI5Y2U2Y2IyMDE0NzQ5MDVk" data-original-margin="">The fog is growing even denser, and it's hard to see more than 3 meters ahead now.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTFmMjAyODM5MTQ5Mjc5ZjY3YzczYTAzNTExZTU5" data-original-margin="">I'm covered in sweat, breathing heavily, and my heart is beating out of my chest... For some reason, a grin creeps across my face.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2YxZjkyMjY2ODRjMGRiNDkwZTAxNmFiNDFhZDFm" data-original-margin="">I'm in the worst possible situation, but I'm loving every second of it. I'll make it out of here alive.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDBiZTJiMGZlNDRhOGM4Yjc4NTgxY2RiZWVlNDQz" data-original-margin="">I launch another dual attack from my blades as I twist around a rock pile ahead to watch them both collide with something hard right in front of me.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWYwZTA1YWQ1ZTQzMDZhYzZhOTAxZDJhMGEzMzVj" data-original-margin="">My eyes widen as I watch a glossy stone sword covered in red mana shielding appear from the mist.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjI4ZjY5YmI4MjQxZWRiNzRhZmVjZmZhMDMyZTBm" data-original-margin="">It's almost like it just appeared out of thin air. Luckily, the collision of my two energy attacks gave me an early warning to air-step upwards, narrowly avoiding the incoming stone arm.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjVlMDdkMDJiZjQ4ZWQ4NzE1OGFkNTQ5ZjEyOTAw" data-original-margin="">The moment I jump up, its blade follows me from below. I let out another two attacks in the direction of the monster's body to give me a better idea of its exact positioning, then start to charge up my real attack.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2ZjZjRhNDE2OTQxYWVhYmU5OWM1ZDQyNTc0ODQz" data-original-margin="">The moment I see two more dim white lights through the red fog, I teleport blindly above their exact location.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWM0OWU1ODMzNjRlMjRiYzM5YjliNzRlMjdiMTFk" data-original-margin="">With a yell, my dual 2350MP attack makes contact with the beast below. I can't see where I hit, but I know it was a successful shot.</p>
<p class="cnM4NTg3OGI2NWEyMDRhYWQ5ZDZhMGYxMjc5ZGE0OTky" data-original-margin="">I feel the heat of my fire magic erupting and hear the loud cries of the behemoth underneath me.</p>
<p class="cnNkNGYzNDdjMTBiMTQxZjNhNGIwODMzOTA3YTJhYjZi" data-original-margin="">I grit my teeth and attempt to air-step backward, but I'm hit with another surge of dense red mana from the injured beast.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzViNWY0ZTVlMTRmYTliY2E2MmZlZmRiZjliMjZi" data-original-margin="">I grunt, then let out a yell of agony as the wave of MP makes its way deep into my veins.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjliNmI5NmJjZTQzY2M4Nzk5NDM0NzJjNjQ2NDE2" data-original-margin="">My skin burns as soon as I'm hit, and I feel my organs twist and turn.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGIyNmNkNmJiZDQ3NjA5YzEyZmUxNTgwZTk5MDRj" data-original-margin="">Almost 1/4 of my health drops from this single wave.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDUzYWY0YmQwNTRkOGE5OGMyMzRlNGJhYjJmNDc5" data-original-margin="">I cough up blood as I'm paralyzed in mid-air for a fraction of a second. I grit my teeth and see the flaming arm of the stone-covered Behemoth's blade come flying out of the fog in front of me.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2ViOTViMzU0MzQwZGM4MmJjMTFiOWM5NzU2NTQ4" data-original-margin="">I Dungeon Walk to the floor, and its glossy blade cuts through the air right where I was moments ago.</p>
<p class="cnNmZWY2ZTQ3YTY0NDQ1YTNiZWNlMGZkY2U3NDdiYmM3" data-original-margin="">If not for my attack hitting its armor earlier, covering it in fire magic, I wouldn't have sensed the monster's sword in time...</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWNlNzQ4ZjM3YTRhMzdhOWI3Yjk4ZTVjZWNiNjU4" data-original-margin="">Immediately, I start sending more waves of mana into the thick fog. My arms and legs are starting to tingle again... but there isn't much I can do about it.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODA2NmJkNWEyZDRkMjFiNzMyNTBhM2VhMjE3ZWQ1" data-original-margin="">I've increased my MP output to nearly full capacity. I'm not able to possibly let out more than 5k MP worth of attacks at a single time with the appropriate density and width.</p>
<p class="cnM3Nzg0MTg5MTZmNDQ4OTVhYjAwNDcyMjU4MmRjZjBk" data-original-margin="">The hot and heavy feeling of a Strengthening Fragment's final moments starts to burn in my chest.</p>

<p class="cnMxNzNhNmY4OTMxNzQ3OWM5MzYyNWE3ZjIwYjAxOTYw" data-original-margin="">I whisper under my breath while throwing another dual attack into the red abyss.</p>

<p class="cnNlNjgzMTViZTJjMDQzOGM4ZTkyMjAxZDA1ZjNiMDM5" data-original-margin="">The faint white light of one of my detection shots finally makes an impact on the beast. I lock onto its location and instantly begin charging up a new attack. This one has to be big...</p>
<p class="cnNiYmIxMGY2NzA1YzRlMmQ4OGNhNTM5M2UwMTc0NzYw" data-original-margin="">Letting out a yell, and teleporting blindly into the fog directly above where the light from earlier shined, I release an attack downward with all my might.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTk5MzVjYTI1NTQyNzNhZDZjNjQ1YmY1ZWM5YjMw" data-original-margin="">I feel the final remnants of the Strengthening Fragment give me a boost of MP, greater than any attack I've realeased before.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODFhN2UxY2EzZDRkMjM5NzJjZjdmMTY4ZDg0ZTU4" data-original-margin="">A dual strike with just over 2500MP per blade rockets downward at the monster below.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDI1YjliMzA3NDRmYTFhNmFhMGI4ODNhMDNkMjk4" data-original-margin="">Almost instantly, I hear the roar of a furious beast, and the heat of an explosion, but something unexpected happens.</p>

<p class="cnNhMTAyZjgzZGE3ZjRmYzk4MTliOTlhZGNkZTJmMTFm" data-original-margin="">My heart stops as I let out a groan. Another 1/4 of my health is ripped from my body, and a mana-reinforced blade comes soaring towards my unguarded frontside.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjAxOGRkMjI5ZTQwMWFiNWI0MTcyNTdhNGNhZTJh" data-original-margin="">I just landed my most powerful attack so far on the Boss, but it was thinking one step ahead.</p>

<p class="cnMzNDMwOGMxZTZiNTRjNDFiYjY5NTczODVhM2NiZDQ4" data-original-margin="">I watch the bright flash of mana-imbued armor begin to fracture and burst. A white light blinds me as I'm faced with a sudden feeling of dread.</p>
