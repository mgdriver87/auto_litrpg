                <p class="cnMwMTEyMWI1ODViYjQ2ZWU5M2ZlMzYzODRlN2M3ZWVm" data-original-margin="">I hear words echo through my brain from the figure at the back of the room loud and clear, but I'm not sure I can believe what I'm hearing.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQzMGFkNWE0ZjQ5NDJhZDE3ODYzOTQyOWYxMjg1" data-original-margin="">It speaks.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjc3ZTZjYTlmZTRmYjg5Y2Y0YjBmNGRmMmZlMGY3" data-original-margin="">"Visitors don't come here often... I never would have expected a Demon and a Dragon to show their faces in a place like this."</p>
<p class="cnNmMzA3NzZjMmJiNzQzMWU5NjVhMWIzZTE1NTM5ZTZm" data-original-margin="">I stop walking forward and raise my sword.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmEzNjM3MzAzNTQ0NGI5MDVhMTk0M2Q4OGMwMTM1" data-original-margin="">The red cloud of mana-infused fog consolidates around what seems to be the being's head.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTdhNzgyNTYyYjRmY2ZiY2ZjNDM1ZTUwNWI0YjYw" data-original-margin="">Standing on an elevated stage at the back of the room, it towers above me around 3 meters tall. It's wearing what looks like a black suit of armor. It's so dark that it looks like the shadow of a Knight in physical form.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTFhZjM1YzkxNjQwNzc5NzZlZDM3MDFjMTkxZWU0" data-original-margin="">The blood-red mana creates a sphere around the figure's head. It continues to speak.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTY4YzhkZmRiMTRmZTg4NTUxZTExNjk2MDIxOGI2" data-original-margin="">"Have you come to challenge me? I thought I'd never see that day when Dungeon Masters went rogue. To think you'd attack a Labyrinth at a time like this! Defying our leader's rules before the great collapse? Could my eyes be playing tricks?"</p>
<p class="cnMyZjFkMmJkNWMxNjQ0MTM5NGViM2JlYjZiZTljYzNl" data-original-margin="">The figure lifts one of its arms, pointing a finger at the wall to my right side.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWRmMmMzNzQ2ODRjZjc4ZWE1OWQzZTBhMmZmZGZk" data-original-margin="">I watch small threads of thin mana leave its jet-black fingers and shoot off toward piles of empty silver armor and wooden crates. The threads attach themselves to the piles of abandoned armor, then they begin to move...</p>
<p class="cnMyZDI3YTRkMzU0ODRjMmRiMWZkZjE5NzRhZGNiNzI0" data-original-margin="">I whisper under my breath while jumping backward to put a few rows of white tables between us.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDQyMGIwNTA3YzQ1ODI4ZTk0YzBlNWRlYTNmODYy" data-original-margin="">"Mana Manipulation..."</p>
<p class="cnM3NzFhYTYzZmFjYjRhYzQ4NzZhMWJmZDJlNDBkNDFk" data-original-margin="">That's how it worked before. That's why I was gaining no levels from defeating those guards. The Knights outside were just tools being controlled by this ominous figure's mana.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzVjZjY3ZDFhYzQ3MGNhODkxMmEyNzUwNTFlZDFk" data-original-margin="">The armored suits begin to glow, then stand up on their own, covered in a dense layer of mana shielding. The shadow figure speaks up again.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTg0MWI2YzBkMzQ1ZjlhZjRkMDM5NzAwNWI4YzU3" data-original-margin="">"You may leave now, I'm not one to fight my own kind over a meaningless break-in."</p>
<p class="cnM0NDU3MWZlZWRhMjQ1NDBiMGJlODk3NjNhZjJiNTU1" data-original-margin="">I tighten my gaze, watching the Boss at the back of the room and keeping an eye on its new minions. It continues to speak through our link.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzdiNGNmNjE2YzQyNDU4YmIzM2JkZjk4MTQzYjZh" data-original-margin="">"Unfortunately for you, the Dungeon Master will be hearing of this, I must report all oddities."</p>
<p class="cnNjMmNiM2FmZDllMjQzMzBhMjkzZmI4OWViZDJmOTE4" data-original-margin="">The manipulated suits of armor stand guard and the shadowy figure doesn't move. I smirk, finally replying.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmQ0ZGZmNzM2ZjQwZGE5YzU1NmVkM2M3YjA0NmU2" data-original-margin="">"You're... The Behemoth...?"</p>
<p class="cnNmZDkwY2QxYWI2NTQ3ODZhYWI1YjY1NTY2NTBlZWMy" data-original-margin="">My smile turns into a chuckle.</p>
<p class="cnNhZGE3NTZlZDQyZDRhNGJhZWVkYWE0M2VhMTI1ZmM4" data-original-margin="">"I thought you'd be a lot bigger..."</p>
<p class="cnM2MWU4NmUwOTBlYjQyNzBhOTdhZjkxNTQ1ZDUyMDhj" data-original-margin="">The clang of metal armor rings out in the room as the monster before me breaks its thin threads of mana that were previously keeping the guards upright.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDUwMDY1NzNjODQ3OGFiNGZmMjUyODk5NTMzZjcz" data-original-margin="">It takes a mighty leap, jumping off the stage above to drop down in front of me.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTEwNTYwZDNiMjQzNDhiNjY5MzZlNzMyMmJkMjYw" data-original-margin="">My eyes are locked straight, and my sword is fully charged, but I continue to sidestep through the white tables keeping my distance of about 15 meters away.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmMxOGY0MGRkMjQxMWQ4NjgyZDJhMjVhN2MyZjU5" data-original-margin="">It hits the ground with a loud thud, cracking the stone tiles and sending a shock wave through the ground.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2E5ZDJjODZhODQ4YTc4NzI1M2U3NGZiZGNiNGMw" data-original-margin="">Its deep voice rings out in my head as the monster moves closer. I can't see its face through the cloud of red fog, but I can feel a curious evil gaze.</p><p class="cmJmZDMyMzc4MGM3YTQ4NThiZmI2ZDVlNDA5NzMwYWYz" data-original-margin="">The story has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTAzOGJhYmRkZDRhNDE4MjIwNGI5YTkzMzM1Y2Jm" data-original-margin="">I keep all my stat-boosting skills fully active, glowing red and gold while drinking a mana potion to re-up my MP bar.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjA5M2I4MzVlZTQzOGJhN2ExMzEyODhlMTcyZjIz" data-original-margin="">The moment I raise the glass bottle, the anonymous figure speaks again with a lighter tone than before.</p>
<p class="cnNiYWYwYjQ3ZTU2ZjQxN2Q5YTJlMjk2M2ZjMjk4NzRj" data-original-margin="">"A potion... You're a human aren't you...? Now... this is quite a surprise."</p>
<p class="cnNhNjY1YTU2YzUyODRmZDk4ZDVjMDUzMjE4YTJjMjM5" data-original-margin="">I finish my bottle, replying through my link.</p>
<p class="cnNlYmQyYWY1YWFhNTQwOTE4MWY4Njc3YTE3MjJlNDRk" data-original-margin="">"I am, and you're the Lower-Floor Boss are you not?"</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDAxMGQ4MmI3ODQxMjU5ZmUyNWNjMzhmMDU2YzY1" data-original-margin="">It pauses for a moment, then lets out a slow laugh.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWMzMjUwOTVkOTQ3MDg5ZDM4YTFiODAxZDg0ZmJj" data-original-margin="">"I am. Straight to business it is. You're the first one in over half a century to challenge this floor using those unique skills. Telepathy and a Plundering Ability... from a human..."</p>
<p class="cnNhZWQ5M2Q3MTAyYzQyNGNhMzM3ZmJmMDg5NDIyYTY5" data-original-margin="">It laughs loudly and slowly while I grit my teeth, continuing to sidestep through the tables, trying to get a good angle on the monster as it walks around crushing more and more stone tiles with each step showing no urgency to fight me.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2UwYTk1YTRjMDQxNjNiZmVhNzIxZmI1NTdhMzky" data-original-margin="">It seems this monster has some self-control. Most Bosses are mindless beasts that attack anything in sight. This one seems to have free will.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTg2ZjgxMDU0MjQwZTNiNTM2MGVhOGM3NDkwNTgy" data-original-margin="">It doesn't matter much to me though.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2VhNGYxMDliNjRjNTc5ZjhmODk0OGFhZDNjNWUy" data-original-margin="">I reply.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTdlNDdjYWRkODQyZTI5M2I5YzEwNDk3ZTA4NjEx" data-original-margin="">"That's all I needed to hear. You're the Boss, so I'll defeat you."</p>
<p class="cnNhNzc3MTIzYjdhYjQxNzE4MTQ0ZWE2ODBmM2E1YmI2" data-original-margin="">I watch the Knight shaped shadow gaze up at the ceiling, fully exposing its left side. I air-step forward, aiming my charged sword directly at its weak spot.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTY1MDZhYzNiNzQwMjdiMDEyYTM5NGM2YjFjNDU5" data-original-margin="">It's standing in the middle of the banquet hall without a weapon or a shield... It has let its guard down because it thought I was on its side.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTI5YzQwMzIzZDQ0NmU5YjU3ZTdkYjlkMDY5MzY2" data-original-margin="">This is the perfect time to strike.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2U1YzA2MmI0MzQzZDc4MzM4NTQ5YmQ2MWM0NzY5" data-original-margin="">I let out a 1000MP slash from less than 10 meters away just moments after it speaks its last word. The dark crescent of fire rockets toward the Floor Boss without making a sound.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2Y0NTBiMTc3YjRjYzBiZThjNmVjZmNkNjA5NmUz" data-original-margin="">It doesn't move a muscle, the Boss just stands completely still... Blissfully unaware of my deadly approaching strike.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWMyOTJiODA2MzRlNzQ4MWU2ODhjZmVkODk1MjZm" data-original-margin="">As my attack gets closer, I feel the ground rumble beneath my feet.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjEwZGU1NTMyMTQ0MTdhOTBmYTRmZGMzNGNlZTEy" data-original-margin="">The stone tiles next to the shadowy outline begin to ripple like water and the perfectly square-shaped flooring begins to twist and turn.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTI3OTE3Mjc3ODQ5ZmU4MzhiOGY1NzMzNDNkYTE5" data-original-margin="">With my All-Seeing Eye active, I watch mana pour out of the monster's arms and legs saturating the floor below it.</p>
<p class="cnM0YWM1NTJkNDQ0MTQzOGZiYTFiMjk3M2U2OTczMDgz" data-original-margin="">The air and dungeon mass all around this creature waves and churns as my attack nears.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjZjNzk3MzQ0MTRlNGY4NTY4YWI3MTFhMGI5ZGE0" data-original-margin="">The stone floor rises from the ground in a liquid form, wrapping around the dark figure's legs and climbing up its torso.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWRiNTYwOGQ1NjQ4M2U4MzZiNTZmNDllOTI2NDU0" data-original-margin="">My eyes widen as I watch its entire body become covered in a thick layer of stone. Mana threads are weaved in and out of the material in such a fine grid-like pattern that I can barely tell the difference between a mana shield and the rock it's manipulating into a stone suit of armor.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDc4YzMyYzNkZjRkM2U5MjM0YWU4NGFlNzZjZjUx" data-original-margin="">Now, standing over 4 meters tall, a grey suit of stone armor turns to me. It molds its right arm into a double-sided stone blade to counter my incoming attack.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTcyZDEyYjgzYzRjMDViNzIyOTlkZjdlMDgyZmVl" data-original-margin="">It coats its weapon in a dense layer of shielding and thrusts it upwards as my black blade makes contact with its stone armor. Without a hint of resistance, my incoming strike is deflected into the sky.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDYwYjE5MjVjMzRkNjZiNTUzYzVkNGMxNmJjODE5" data-original-margin="">It spins out of control, cutting through the glass ceiling above and flying off into the Dungeon's open air.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWJlZjE4ZjU5ODRkMzhhMDI3NTExOGU2Nzg4OGZi" data-original-margin="">I gulp, as I just witnessed all of this go down in fractions of a second...</p>
<p class="cnMyZTE2OTM5NjNhOTQ4NmRiMjlhNThiNTlhOTdmNmU4" data-original-margin="">This monster went from a defenseless shadow talking smack, to a Stone Knight ready for war.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDdkMzc3NWY1YjRhZDQ4MjA0YzNhYjM5YWFjM2Y5" data-original-margin="">The Deep voice of the Floor Boss rings out in my head again.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWFmZmY5NWJmYTQyOTQ5OGFkMWIyNjdmNzljMmIw" data-original-margin="">"If it's a fight you want, then it's a fight you'll get. You better not waste my time. With skills like yours, and the nerve of you to come in here with another Labyrinth's Dragon, you better put up a good fight."</p>
<p class="cnMwMjA4OGRlMWRmZjQzNDE4NDA5ODJhYjYxNWFiYTIx" data-original-margin="">The stone armor covering its left arm shifts into a sharp blade as well. A small slit in its stone helmet opens up and dense red fog pours out. I still can't see the monster's eyes, but I know it's staring right at me.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjExMGI2N2QwODQyNzk4ODEwMzhlY2M0NjQ1YmRm" data-original-margin="">So I glare back.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjRiMDBhNzkzNjRiMTI4OWFmMGVlMjFjYjYxODBh" data-original-margin="">Glossy sharp blades of stone line both of its arms, and they're dripping with dense mana. Similar to my own sword...</p>
<p class="cnMwMDQwNGY0MDc4ZTRkNTRhOTRhZTRmZDExYzM3YTU4" data-original-margin="">Not only are its bladed arms leaking mana-dense aura, but the entire rest of its body is covered in shielding intertwined with its mana-manipulation ability.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2IzMzA4ODgxOTQyYjFhOWZlNTIwOWJhNzc3Yjlk" data-original-margin="">It's nothing like the shielding I saw from any monsters before, not even like Fisher's when I tested my strike back on Floor 10.</p>
<p class="cnM5MGI3OTJkZjQyNzQ4OWJiNDkwOWU2NTBjMTBjMDdm" data-original-margin="">Most shielding is invisible to the naked eye. I'm only able to perceive it because of my All-Seeing Eye ability.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjA3OWFhY2NlNTRmMmRiZmMwNzljOWRjZjNjZmYz" data-original-margin="">This shielding is glowing crimson-red, bright as day. Even without the use of my perception ability active. I'd be able to see its defenses without a problem.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTEwZWQzZTQxYTQwMTg5YzQ4ZTVlMGIwN2JkMWFh" data-original-margin="">The blood-red glowing stone-covered Knight takes a step forward. I expect it to crack the floor beneath its feet, but the ripping water-like visual appears again as it seemingly bounces off the floor.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzY1Yzk2OTk4NTQyOGQ4MjBiNWI4OWIyZGI0YzBi" data-original-margin="">In the blink of an eye, the creature lunges toward me with its bladed arms pointed at my neck.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWU4MzI4NWFlMDQyYTdhM2ZkNmQxMDMzY2IwZWVj" data-original-margin="">I Dungeon Walk backward about 20 meters the moment my battle instincts kick in. Opening my link with Ember, I give the order that starts our brawl.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzNlODc3Y2M2ODRjZGRhNGE4MDk5YTg2MWI4Njk2" data-original-margin="">"Run. This is a battle between the Floor Boss and me. It has two skills that I'll need for future fights, and I want to defeat it fair and square then steal its power."</p>
<p class="cnMyNzllYmMzOTc0YzRkN2RhNWU4YjZmMzRiMzFjMGRi" data-original-margin="">My eyes light.</p>
<p class="cnM2M2NmYTZhMmIzNTQ2NTdiOWYzMTI0YTNmMDM5OTI0" data-original-margin="">From across the room, the Stone Knight comes charging toward me. Its red glow reflects in my eyes as my battle-obsessed grin creeps across my face.</p>
<p class="cnNhMWYwYjlkY2U0NDQ5N2M4Y2ExMDI1ZmM3MzM4Nzk3" data-original-margin="">I run forward as Ember flaps his wings to fly high up into the open air of the large banquet hall.</p>
<p class="cnNmNGMxMzA0NDIxMTQyYjliYzE0MjZhN2Q4NTNkNzFi" data-original-margin="">The battle against the Lower-Floor Boss begins. Soon I'll find out why this beast is called... The Behemoth.</p>
