There are over 30 members just working here, helping with cooking, cleaning, and maintenance; consuming an average of 1 pill every 2 weeks. On top of that, roughly 20 of us do extensive training, using the full 3-pill max; we run through about 75 Pills a week in total. However, in the off-season, we consume little to none, only taking in Qi from the gathering rooms."</p>
<p class="cnMxY2QyNDU4NjA3MTRmNDE4NjBjYTEzM2ZkMzNkMzAz" data-original-margin="">I respond with an eyebrow raised.</p>
<p class="cnNlNGJjNDI0MzBiNTQ1MWI5OTY3YjI1YzQxNWY1MTQy" data-original-margin="">"Oh, so you go through hundreds without much issue on draining your supply?"</p>
<p class="cnM0NDJjMmMzMDczMTRjNmJiMjJmNDkxNjc4NzU3Mzcz" data-original-margin="">"Yes, and no. This is only in response to the Dark One's recent changes to the city. There are some exceptions like me; I bring in most of our income, so I'm allowed to restore my Qi before tournament battles. Plus, some of us sent out on missions away from the city take larger portions of pills along. And of course, I've made an exception for you three."</p>
<p class="cnNlM2Q2NzIxYmM3YjQ1NjJiZTRiZjFjZTM0MzVmYWRk" data-original-margin="">Monk bows his head at each of us before continuing.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDVmZWUxMGM3YzQ2NWU4Yzk4NmQyYWIxOWUxOWQ0" data-original-margin="">"We would be rationing our supply much more heavily if there was no immediate threat. There is only so much stored up in the supply chamber, and we run through them faster than they can be created. We have to think of our future at all times."</p>
<p class="cnNjZGU1OGVmOTE2MTRiZmRhZGYyNTY2ODAyZmFmZDc1" data-original-margin="">I nod slowly.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTE0ZmU3NzNhZDQyNjdhODM4ZGRhNmU3NmJjMTU3" data-original-margin="">"But if I helped rid you of this impending threat, cutting into a chunk of your supply wouldn't be the end of the world. Let me do a test with a two-week supply, 150 pills. It won't go to waste."</p>
<p class="cnM5NmRlZmI5YmZhYzQ5MmU4ZTQxYTExZWE5NDhhNjc0" data-original-margin="">Staring forward with a confident expression, I eagerly await Monk's response. Considering his explanation of their pill usage, this whole monastery uses up 750 total pills in their training season, and most likely not much more than 1000 in a given year. I know 150 may be a lot to gift to a random person who showed up this week, but going back into that Titan's domain just to raise my base by 10 pills worth of Qi doesn't seem worth another 6 months of perceived time.</p>
<p class="cnM4OGFmYzgyNTVjZTRlNDliMzM5MWIzNWY4MjUwYTY0" data-original-margin="">Monk responds with little to no hesitation in his voice.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWNmZTAwZThkYzRjZmJhZjU3NDRiY2IxMjAyZTVi" data-original-margin="">"This is fine. It seems like a good investment. I'll retrieve them after our meal."</p>
<p class="cnNjNmYzZWJhODI4MTQzNDY5MjJhNzgxMTg2NDg1ZjZi" data-original-margin="">Then, he takes another bite as I grin.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzFlYzUxZDRjZDRkNTNhZDE3NmZhZmQ5ZTYzYmM2" data-original-margin="">"Excellent. That was easy."</p>
<p class="cnM1YjhhYjUxODE3OTQzMDNiNWFiZjkwMTc0YTVjN2Ri" data-original-margin="">Our meal finishes, and the conversation is mostly a few questions about what my Qi gathering technique is, but I deflect it multiple times to say it's a work in progress before the topic switches to the items Maria and Abby farmed and both of their advancements to level 645.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTc0MTJhZGFjOTQzNTRiYWY5YWJlOGM5NDc5YmVk" data-original-margin="">Once Monk gets up to retrieve the pills, Maria turns to me and speaks in a low tone so no one can hear.</p>
<p class="cnMyNGRiNjNmYzFkMTQxNTRhOTgwZDY5NWQ0NWFlNTgx" data-original-margin="">"We should stop by the restaurant in the gold district before we go to the fighting ring tonight. I want to craft some new items with our loot."</p>
<p class="cnMyYTAzOTViODE3YTQyNDRiZWY0M2MzYjViYzc2NDNi" data-original-margin="">I agree to the idea, but break the news that I'd like to go experiment more with Qi gathering while they fight in the arena. Monk overhears the end of our conversation as he returns with a large metallic rectangular box in hand.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDUzY2JjNTZlNTRiMTdiMDdlNjE4MTMxMjVkYTAz" data-original-margin="">"Well, we have about an hour and a half until the matches begin. If you don't show tonight, it may build your fighter hype even further. Just leaving without a word of goodbye after a record-breaking match like that is a good marketing stunt. Higher-ups in the platinum district will surely be curious where you've gone, and many fans will be waiting for your return."</p>
<p class="cnNjN2M3ZGNkZmM3ZDRlMjRhYTRjZTM2MjZkYjJmNmMw" data-original-margin="">I shrug.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGQzOTAxOWJjMDQyYmQ5OTUwNGZiNGI5YjY3Mjg4" data-original-margin="">"I'll be back to give them a real show once I'm ready."</p>
<p class="cnMxMWEwYzE5NjJjYzQzZGNiYzE5ODkxN2M2NDU1NTlm" data-original-margin="">After I accept the large metallic box and place it under my robe, Maria, Abby, and I head out of the monastery as Monk waves us goodbye.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTE4NzBiYTE0ODQxYTM4ZjA4ZjQyNjg3MDYyY2Qw" data-original-margin="">"Update me on your process as soon as possible, I'd like to see those pills go to good use."</p>
<p class="cnM5OTcwZGRhNTZlYTQ4NWFhNGUyYjY5YjI5ZGIzZjk4" data-original-margin="">He turns to the girls.</p>
<p class="cnNjOTZiZDk0Nzk2YjRmM2Q5MTBiNWU4OTE2NTY0ZDRh" data-original-margin="">"And I'll see you in the ring tonight."</p>
<p class="cnM1MjkwZmI3YjYwYjQzOWQ4NzI1NDc2NTYxNDkwMTA4" data-original-margin="">In full disguise, we walk through the platinum district together and into the gold to greet Elen in the empty restaurant. The young white-haired woman greets us with a smile.</p>
<p class="cnNjYWU5MTU4MzViNTQ5MjI5MTlhN2VhNGYwNjcwOTAx" data-original-margin="">"A fully sealed room for just an hour? Right this way, we have the same one from last time ready for you."</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTVmMmFiMGQ2ODQ4ZjY5NjJiMTgzNmEwYmY4ZTc0" data-original-margin="">After transferring 5 gold credits through my wristband, we're brought upstairs and down the hall, to walk through 2 heavy-duty mana shielded doors before all sprawling out on the large comfortable couch in the middle of the suite.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTY3NDJlMWIxODRkMjM4MGQ0ODg3MDAzYjNjNDJi" data-original-margin="">We all take off our concealment items and disguises, then Abby is the first to speak.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDZkMzc2ZjE0ODQ3MzY4YTQ4YjQ0M2FiNWEyYmMx" data-original-margin="">"So, I was thinking a new pair of boots, a dagger set, and maybe a ring too. I'm looking to upgrade my speed and agility stats even further."</p>
<p class="cnMzZGI2ZWMyZWNlZTRkN2RiZDI1NGM5YWVjYjAyZTBh" data-original-margin="">Over a dozen crimson speed crystals come pouring out of her item box as her eyes sparkle with possibilities.</p>
<p class="cnM0NmZlYTEwODZiMTRjNTFhOTIyM2I2YjQ5N2NjYTMx" data-original-margin="">I activate my Rising Emperor's Domain to share my craftsmanship skill with both my teammates while Maria reaches into her item box too.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTFiMDQwMDhiYTRhM2I4NTUzYWVhNzk1NDc4NWRk" data-original-margin="">Once she opens the concealment case, the gems that glow bright before my eyes aren't exactly what I was expecting. There are 10 royal blue ice stones pouring light white and blue mist from them, but next to these, I see 4 clear-colored stones that push wisps of air in miniature tornadoes.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmY3NmQxODFlMjRiZmI5MDk5YjQ3NTlhY2ZkNDVi" data-original-margin="">"Wind Stones too? Is this what you meant by the extra item drops on the 29th floor?"</p>
<p class="cnNhMjAzODg4ODZhNDRjNzY5NzhhZmI3NjY5ZGRmYWU3" data-original-margin="">They both let out a chuckle, while Maria responds, confirming my suspicions.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2YwNTM5NzNiODQ4MTU5NzcxNmViOTBlMzRhZWYw" data-original-margin="">"Yeah! These are for you. I know your dagger set could use them. There are these giant white bird creatures with intense wind magic on the 29th floor. They're really strong... But Abby and I managed to kill a few. Their element stone drop rate is very high, close to 20%."</p>
<p class="cnNiNzdkMTc5NThjNjRmOWM4N2FlNDk0MTM4ODI1NjJk" data-original-margin="">My eyes widen as I accept the 4 stones, then her the leftover ice stones in my item storage I was holding prior and think of the possibilities of a drop rate that high with these new wind stones. While I do, each of their blue status windows pop up as they scroll through the crafting options on their new borrowed Mythic Grade Skill.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDdmNDE2MzFjYTRkN2JhMWI0N2YxNmJmMzA1ODM4" data-original-margin="">I begin taking out some of the items from my storage and look at what new upgrades I can do to my gear too.</p>

<p class="cnMwNGYwZWVhM2ZkYjRkMTk4ZjQ5NTM1NzVlNjQyODNl" data-original-margin="">I merge 3 of the element stones into my dagger set, and their buffs raise drastically.</p>

Finally, my cloak engulfs my whole body and shapeshifts into the suit and business wear that my concealment ring used to create.</p>
<p class="cnM5Yzk3ZWViMTAwZjQyNjk5ZDg5MmRhNzZmNTlhNTcw" data-original-margin="">I release the skill and let it fall back to its original dark black flowing form and can't help but grin.</p>
