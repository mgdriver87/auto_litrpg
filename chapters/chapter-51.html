                <p class="cnNmYzdkNjA4ZmYwNTQzMmM4YmY4YTkyNGFjN2EzY2I1" data-original-margin="">I let the crowd of hunters go into the dungeon first. I'll take my time and venture a bit deeper today to find some harder opponents. I'm probably not ready for the boss yet, it'll take a few days before i can handle that solo.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjZhZjc3ZmExNjQ1NmZhZGEwMjk0MGYzNmJmZTM3" data-original-margin="">There's a large sense of tension from the other parties. This whole dungeon surge thing is a pretty big deal.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWFmZmFkYWRlMDQ2ZjNiYWFkNDYzZDI1MjdhN2E0" data-original-margin="">Once it was my turn to enter I pulled out my sword and jumped through the glowing blue portal.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDRmNWQ2YzEzNDRmYzRhNTU0NWY1YzY5MDI0YmI0" data-original-margin="">I wandered around the Minotaur Dungeon without any problems. The monsters became stronger and stronger as the day went on.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjI4NTQ5YzAwYTRhYjA4MmI5MWUxMjg5NzViY2M0" data-original-margin="">In 6 hours I faced off against 7 groups in total. There were a few other teams in the dungeon, so whenever I got nearby, I turned the other way to keep my distance. It was a little annoying at first, but overall it didn't really matter.</p>
<p class="cnNkODJmYmFiYTA5NjQxMGNhNjM2ZWE3ZTA4OTBmZjQ0" data-original-margin="">The first 3 groups I fought were pretty easy. They were all level 155-165. It was just mana drops, no level gains at all.</p>
<p class="cnMyMGE3NTM3NGZkNDQ4MTY5Y2NlOTdjZDI3ZWNhNGU1" data-original-margin="">The next two groups were a bit harder. They were both lead by a boss with a pretty high level. One was Lv. 188, the other was Lv. 191. The Lv. 188 dropped an axe, the other 5 Minotaurs dropped only mana. I gained 4 levels from these battles.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTY4NDBhZjVjODQ5NDliMmY3ODc3OTUyYWI2OTE3" data-original-margin="">It's much easier to level grind now that I can use my opponents MP. I'm getting hit while blocking occasionally, but with every increasing level the damage is becoming less and less.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWExNzJjMjBkMjQyZTI5MzRmNmY1ZjY0MmRkNmI3" data-original-margin="">The next group I fought had a surprising twist. It consisted of 4 total minotaurs. Their levels were 176, 177, 180, and 182. At first the monsters actually gave me a run for my money. They attacked in charges of two and had similar strength to my own. My only advantage was speed. I dragged the battle out for a long time while hardening for defense and absorbing their MP simultaneously landing cheap shots whenever I could. After this battle I had to drink an HP potion to recover fully.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmQzNTllOTQ0OTQyNjRhOGUxZTYyN2UzMjFmNGEw" data-original-margin="">The more I fight in this dungeon the more I understand why guilds love to come here. These beasts are good fighters, but they don't have any mind-blowing moves. As long as a team has proper gear and teamwork, power leveling is a breeze.</p>
<p class="cnM3Yjg2MTYwYTVmMTQ4MTc5MWVjYmUzNWY0ODFmNmNi" data-original-margin="">After this battle I gained 3 more levels and collected 4 huge mana crystals.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTE2ZGJiMTMxYzRjMDk4NTAzNTlkMjFiMWI3YzUw" data-original-margin="">My final group was even more of a challenge. It was a group of 2 minotaur. One was a level 161 and the other stood at a staggering level 202.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWI2Mjg3ZmZiOTQyOTc5NTdmOGFkMzZiZjFkN2U2" data-original-margin="">The lower level monster was defeated very quickly at the beginning of the fight.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDg5MjdkNmIzOTQ2NzhiMTRjOWY4NTBlNmMwYWE2" data-original-margin="">The Level 202 was definitely a challenge though. It was very strong and very fast. My small frame and agility were my only upside when it came to basic stats. I had to play it very safe and slowly chip away at the beast while blocking its attacks with a hardened left arm.</p>
<p class="cnMwZmM5YTFkMzA5MzRjNzNiMTNiZmQ2MjMwNTYxN2Nm" data-original-margin="">It chipped me down to about half of my HP before the battle was over. Both of these monsters just dropped mana crystals, no extra loot. I gained 3 levels from this battle.</p>
<p class="cnMyNGRiN2ZmNDVmZjQxMmY5ZDY5ODljYzRiYWNmMjkz" data-original-margin="">After this fight I took a small break to sit by a tree and check my status.</p>

<p class="cnNjZmNjODk3ZDUzMTRmNzBhOTJiOGViNDEwNmU2NzM4" data-original-margin="">After a quick rest I got up with a grin on my face and started heading back to the dungeon entrance. I need to stock up on HP portions, I didn't realize how tough some of these higher level minotaurs are. Plus, a bite to eat wouldn't hurt. I'll come back right after and continue this level grinding.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGVhOTcxZTdjNzQ4MWFhNzlhZmVkM2ViNGJmYzk5" data-original-margin="">It took about an hour, but I made it back to the floating blue portal and left the dungeon. I heard one team fighting a nearby group of monsters on the way back but didn't encounter any myself.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWZkYjQ4ZDk3MTQxMjE4MTQyOGU2NWZlMWZhNThi" data-original-margin="">I exited the dungeon and took the train back to the main Hub. When I made it up to the surface I could see a pretty big commotion going on by the E Class escalator. There were two extra guards in front preventing people from passing. One of them was speaking to a group, I couldn't help but listen in.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDBmODg1MDcwNDQzNTY5NTBiNTM5YWVhODVhZmM2" data-original-margin="">"We're sorry to delay all of your hunting. There's been 2 large E Class breaks. It shouldn't be much of a problem, the bosses will be cleared soon. We have temporary raised the entrance standard to a D Class minimum for 1 hour. Please bare with us, this is for your safety."</p>
<p class="cnMxMzE5MmRiYTZkZTQxZTJiNGVkZTc3N2YwMzNlNWMy" data-original-margin="">I raised an eyebrow. A couple E class dungeon breaks huh? Maybe it wouldn't hurt if I checked it out. I took out my ID and showed the guard while asking him a question.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjdkOTUwMzk0ODQ1NDRhNjNhYjg4ZWEyZDliZjVh" data-original-margin="">"Hey, uh. Which dungeons were the ones that had a break?"</p>
<p class="cnMwMmRkM2U2NjQwMTQ5MjhhODI2N2FkMjQwMjMxNDUz" data-original-margin="">He nodded to let me pass.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDk3OWUzNzY5NTRkYmVhMzUyM2NkMWI0OWYxODk2" data-original-margin="">"There's a pretty bad goblin dungeon break, its lower level and should be cleared within the hour. The other seems to be a rat dungeon, it should be cleared much sooner. We just got news to shut off the area to newbies just in case."</p>
<p class="cnMyMTg1M2FjMzk4MzQxOGY4OGE1OTUyMDZlZDAyNDAx" data-original-margin="">"Alright. Understood."</p>
<p class="cnM2OGVkNTc0MzRkYzRiY2M5YTUxZTYyMzdmMmM5N2Q2" data-original-margin="">I headed down to the E Class platform to check things out. They have a goblin dungeon here too? I wonder what it's like? The rat dungeon sounds disgusting, I don't mind missing out on that. The only break I've ever seen was that previous cyclops dungeon break... and I was very under prepared. This one should be fairly easy, some rare loot may drop if I have enough time to farm.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTg1ZWJkYzVhZTQwNDg5NGU3N2E4MGZlNGJlZmMz" data-original-margin="">It looks like there's a lot of people with the same idea as me. As I got down to the platform it was pretty chaotic. I read the info board and sure enough the train with all the parties surrounding it was the goblin dungeon. I could see about 20 other hunters in 6 separate groups ranging from 2-5 members. It looks like I'm the only solo hunter here.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDExMjRkNDJiNDRmYWFhNTQ5ZGU1OTgyZDI3N2Rh" data-original-margin="">We all boarded the train and were off shorty after. It was a quick ride, no more than 3 minutes. Everyone on the train was getting anxious. They were either scared of what was in that dungeon or were just inching to fight. I for one, was itching to fight.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDliOTE4YjczNTRlZjFhMzI1NjdkYzY4ZjY3N2Vh" data-original-margin="">Once the stop arrived we all piled out and went up the escalator to be met with a floating red portal. I could feel the dense magic in the air. This is definitely a dungeon break.</p>
<p class="cnM3NmM5ZjZjZTFiYzRkZjg5YzcyZmFiOWY5ODM4OGZh" data-original-margin="">I let a few people jump through first, but I followed soon after. We all dispersed once entering.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTY2ZGJhNWYyZjRhNmJhZjRiZDYwMzlhNmZiOGFm" data-original-margin="">It's actually pretty similar to the old goblin dungeon I used to hunt at. That brings back memories. Theres thick tall grass everywhere and occasional trees. It's basically an open plane dungeon.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDMyYTNkMjZiODRmODI4NTJiY2QwMzcyYTdjOWU3" data-original-margin="">No more than 2 minutes in I already encountered a monster. It was just a goblin, I used inspect.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTdjZDYxYTBhMTQzYmRiNDgwYTU5ZTVjMTc4OWZk" data-original-margin="">[Lv. 13]</p>
<p class="cnM0YmMyZGQyZWZmZDRjNGFhMTBjZmNjMmYwYzAzMzJj" data-original-margin="">I chuckled a little and cut it in half with a lazy swing of my sword. It is definitely stronger than your average goblin, but at this level I can't tell the difference. I walked further into the dungeon. A few more goblins ran at me, but they were defeated in seconds. I didn't even bother to collect the mana.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2UwZjc1MzBmYzQ2M2RiNjhiOTNkMWYzNWRmMWI5" data-original-margin="">After 10 minutes or so I was starting to get a bit discouraged. Did I really come down here for this?</p>
<p class="cnNmZTFlOGJmY2RlZTRiOTdhZjllZDlmNGNiYjE0NmU0" data-original-margin="">I was about to turn back, but then I heard a familiar roar.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTliMGQ1NDIyNjQ4Mjc4YTU3YjhmYTljOTNkNjc1" data-original-margin="">I used enemy detection and inspect.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGY3MTg4MGQyZTQ3NWY5NTIwN2ZkZjNiOTI1NzYx" data-original-margin="">[Lv. 41]</p>
<p class="cnNkZjAzOTA5MzA0NDQ2NDhhNjQyZWUwMTAwYmViNWEx" data-original-margin="">Something bigger is here.. I'm intrigued. I ran towards it with my sword ready. To my surprise it was a mutant hobgoblin! This is a pretty bad break, I didn't even know these guys could spawn outside the boss room.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWVmNTE0MDlkYjRhNWI5YWQyZjU1YzUxODM4NWIz" data-original-margin="">The monster charged towards me with its sword pointed straight ahead while grunting and hissing. It was an easy kill, I defeated it in seconds. This gave me hope though, there might be more unusual spawns around here.</p>
<p class="cnNlOGY0Y2VhNWRlNTQ3YTdhZGUxY2UzYWQyZWZkODUy" data-original-margin="">The air started getting denser and denser. This is a good sign, the magic is getting more concentrated. I kept using enemy detection and inspect with a very wide range to look for mutants.</p>
