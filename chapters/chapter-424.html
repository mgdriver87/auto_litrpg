<p class="cnM5NGU3ZGY1MzFlODQ2N2NhMmNiM2U5NGQ4Nzg1ZWVm" data-original-margin="">Close to another hour passes as I continue to farm in the volcanic region, testing out my new water summoning skill and finding that if I use about a fifth of my mana control, they can put up a better fight.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTQ2MWM2ODViODQwZTI4MDBhNzRhZmM2ZTZjM2Ux" data-original-margin="">I reach level 684 before one of them finally drops an advanced fire stone. It burns hot and gives off a dark aura. I place it in my item storage for later, as this is the strongest fire stone I've ever seen.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTNhOTBlZjZhMTQ0OWY5Y2I2ODk2ZWQ3YjE2ZDQz" data-original-margin="">There are plenty of stronger Wyverns deeper in, closer to the Boss room portal, but I want to take my time farming here. Killing monsters just above my level gives me the optimal amount of MCP and PP gains per level up. On top of that, I'm looking to get the maximum number of kills in order to farm element stones too.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWY2ZTYwZGU2NTQ4M2Y4NDljYmVlMTJlYjAyNTVm" data-original-margin="">The drop rate here seems to be less than 2%, but for such a valuable resource, it's actually pretty high.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTA2NTk0MDFhMzRiOGI4NWNjODBkODhjNjJkZDFm" data-original-margin="">The main reason I've stopped now is because I'm well over the agreed-upon timeframe I said I'd meet back up with Bri, and she finally hit level 645 in an intense duel against one of the white-winged hawk creatures on the 29th floor.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDMxMWZhODVhZTQ2MmI4NjFkY2VhZDcxZjRlMzk2" data-original-margin="">Unfortunately, I couldn't find another mutant Wyvern despite camping by the borders of the regions. However, I'll be back here very soon.</p>
<p class="cnM1NWE2ZmQ4MzFhNzRhOGViNjRkNjkwNGNmOWI2MmE4" data-original-margin="">"Dungeon Walker."</p>
<p class="cnNmMDdkOTU1NjgzNzQ0MGE4MGJmODI4NDExZjQ0ODQ4" data-original-margin="">I blip back to see Bri less than 100 meters away and air step down to the ground nearby with my Qi barrier fully activated.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjMzOTEyMWI0MTQ5ZjZhMWE4YjMyOTM0NGQ3MDNi" data-original-margin="">I wave at her as she collects the mana crystal from her last battle and looks at me with a confused and half-startled expression.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDc2NmQ1Nzc0NDQ0MDZhYzA0Y2EwNTg5ZGE5ZTVm" data-original-margin="">"I was wondering when you'd show up... and secretly hoping you'd let me keep at it until I hit the max level in this dungeon... odd how things worked out-"</p>
<p class="cnNjMDJmMDc3MzgxMTQwYWNiNGQzOTcxZWRmODFhODc4" data-original-margin="">I take a few steps closer until we're less than 10 meters apart, then she takes a step back and the confused expression on her face grows.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2UxZWU4NjE3ODQ2YWZhMTRiMzBiNDFkNjFlZWFk" data-original-margin="">"You- look a lot different... and your aura... it's gone."</p>
<p class="cnNlMzhkNDQ4YWQ1ODRlM2FiNTMwMjc0MTVlYWIwMDdh" data-original-margin="">Bri tightens her gaze to look me up and down, unable to piece this puzzle together. I reply.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjE3ZDYyNWVkODRmNjdiZDMyZjE0YzA3YzE1ZDY3" data-original-margin="">"It's a new ability. Probably better if you don't ask. I'm unable to share this one."</p>
<p class="cnM5OGQyYmIxNjNlZjQ2ODhhMjQwMDY0MTQ5NWY4NTAx" data-original-margin="">Her stare remains on me for a moment, and I decide to allow about 20% of my aura out, just like I did while facing the strongest Red Wyvern in the dungeon above us. Her expression shift back to normal. She replies once my aura is able to be felt.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmVjNGY1NTVmNzRkNjVhYmU2ZTc4NjkzNzgxYTNj" data-original-margin="">"Interesting... to my senses, it seemed like you weren't even here. It almost felt like my eyes were playing tricks on me."</p>
<p class="cnNmMjUzYjkxYTllMTQ3YmRiYzcxYjhkMzllZTdkM2U4" data-original-margin="">"Interesting."</p>
<p class="cnMxYzFjMDFhY2E5ODRjY2ZiMDRkOWZmMTI0MGJmNzJm" data-original-margin="">I make a note to myself that I should probably always let a small portion of my mana leak out when interacting with people. A hunter with 0 mana control at all would be even more suspicious than one with an overwhelmingly high amount.</p>
<p class="cnM5NGQxNWM4OWM4YTRiZjQ5ZWFmYzQwODRjZGY0Mzlk" data-original-margin="">Bri reaches into her item box around her waist and walks closer with a smile, pulling out a small concealment case.</p>
<p class="cnNkMjgzZjNlNGNkYjQ4ZWZiMzBkMTQ4NjEwNmE1YmQ4" data-original-margin="">Once she opens it up with a click, I can see what's inside.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTAxODIxYTBlMTQ2NTViODk2NjViZTExMzUyOTg1" data-original-margin="">"Two of the highest quality wind stones I've ever seen. I'm looking forward to seeing what I can craft with these."</p><p class="cmY4ZTZhMGQzZDE1YTQ5MmM4Y2VhZmIwNjdjZWZmOGZk" data-original-margin="">Stolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.</p>
<p class="cnMzYmY2NGY2NTc3MjRkZDc5NTNkMjIwODQxYWJjYTc0" data-original-margin="">She pauses for a moment.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzhkYTE4ODY1MDRkNWRiZWEyYWY3MzczOTU0Mjgz" data-original-margin="">"Hey, I know you said you have a meeting to get back to tonight, but do you think you have a little time to come back to my office? I have a few extremely high-grade items I've been waiting for the right time to craft. With the use of your skill, and my recent strength improvement, I'm sure I can make something extremely unique."</p>
<p class="cnMyYmZhMzFmN2U4ZTRjMzQ5M2FjMDhmYjdhYTY2MWVh" data-original-margin="">I nod and place a hand on her shoulder, dungeon walking us to one of the exit portals that leads into the underground dungeon hub. I activate my conceal skill to shift my face and let my cloak morph into a generic black business suit.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWFhZTI1ODJmMDRkNjZhMmNhOTAwNDllNTI2NmZi" data-original-margin="">While doing this, I also increase my Qi barrier's density to let out an even smaller amount of mana, similar to that of a level 350 hunter that has barely scraped the surface of awakening mana control. We walk out into the underground black market.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTQ5MDNiZWEwZDQ2OTBiYTM5NGM4NjFlOWMzNGJi" data-original-margin="">It doesn't take very long until we make it back to Bri's building and the same blond-haired guard greets us and lets us in.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjljMjMwOTU1YjQyMjZiZDEzMTY0NGNhNTY4NTI2" data-original-margin="">On the first floor, all of the workers have left for the night, and the front doors are locked and fortified. On the second floor, the two twins have left for the night as well, but Bernard still sits at his desk in front of his library of books, deeply immersed in one as he sits with very good posture at his desk.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWE1YzQ2ZGM2ZjRkMzY5N2FkNTcxZGM1NjQwZWNm" data-original-margin="">He gives us a nod as we walk up the stairs into her office. I make a comment in a whispering tone, simultaneously putting up a Hush barrier around us while we make it to the top floor.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDVmODg0YzZlZDQ5ZTNiNDcwMzQ0Mjk0NmJjNTEx" data-original-margin="">"You know, your security here is rather lacking. I got past unnoticed the first time I showed up and even left a clue for your two men out front that I was here. I assume they never notified you?"</p>
<p class="cnMxZGNiYjRmOWVmOTQ3MzU5N2RhOTQ3NGY2YzQ5ZGQ3" data-original-margin="">Bri shakes her head as I continue.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWIwNjViNzFlODRiOWQ5NjYwNmNjMzljNjE3YmVm" data-original-margin="">"The second time, all it took was a little sweet talking to the guard down below in the black market to let me through. Once we're partnered, I think some elite-level guards are in order. Or at least some higher-level mana shielding with an ID scanner as a security precaution."</p>
<p class="cnNjNmFjYWExY2I1ZjQ0MGM5YmI1NWQxNjg0Nzc2MjU3" data-original-margin="">She nods while walking back over to her desk.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzFkZmU5NjcyNzRhZWE5YTA3YWNkZDA4Nzg3MmE4" data-original-margin="">"You're right, you're right. Up until now, all threats and attempted break-ins I receive are from E and D class hunters at most. There's no point in coming to the black market as a higher grade hunter with access to the Dungeon Hub and Association-partnered shops. Even if someone of C-Class or higher were to go rogue, the Association always takes them out before they're much of a problem. That is, unless they can escape to the Dark Continent, there are exceptions of course."</p>
<p class="cnM4MTIzMWM3M2E4NDQwZWJiYjJiNjEyYjJlMTFkNTNi" data-original-margin="">She gives me a sly smile, insinuating she means people like me.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWRmNjg3Njk5MDQ2OGQ5OGI0NzM1ZjRiNjFmY2Fl" data-original-margin="">I sigh and respond.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmY5ZjZmMGFlNTQzNjVhZDI4MTNjYWNmMDcwYzZj" data-original-margin="">"That makes sense, but I just wanted to put it out there. If any of our C and B-Grade goods are being produced and shipped out here, security needs to be heightened. I trust you're strong enough to protect this business yourself, but there will always be times when you're away. Extra backup is needed."</p>
<p class="cnMxMTQ0ZTlmYzQ3ZTQ3MmI4ZjY5ZmRkYzFmOGMwYWZh" data-original-margin="">She nods while I activate my Rising Emperor's Domain buff and give Bri the Mythic Grade Crafting ability.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzQ0NGNkYjAyOTRiZjc4ZDJiYjdlOWNmNmFmMDcw" data-original-margin="">"Check your status, the skill should be there. I have a bit of time so make whatever you'd like."</p>
<p class="cnM4M2Y0NTUyM2U2NTQ2MjZhYjQxMWRjNGY1YjA5Y2E3" data-original-margin="">Bri's eyes light up as her blue status screens begin to form all around her, and she digs into her desk, pulling out many items with varying abilities and buffs ranging from 50% up to 120% and odd-colored stones and potions I've never seen before in my life.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGNkNGJmZjRhNTQ4OThhZDQ5YmQwZjQwNTBmMzIy" data-original-margin="">I don't really care to watch, as I have quite a few other things on my mind.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDQzZWIxNTIwYjRjZTZhZTI4YWQ2ZTZhYWViMGQ5" data-original-margin="">The first thing that still piques my curiosity is what kind of elemental stones the mutants on the 30th floor drop. However, the second most significant topic that has been on my mind for months of perceived time, ever since my second Qi training period in the Titans Domain, concerns what Fisher and Lydia will reveal about their findings in Sector 2.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzAxZjJmY2Y1MjQ3Y2RiOWYxY2U2Yzc3NjZiMmJi" data-original-margin="">It's been a huge mystery looming over me ever since I entered Valor City, and I'll be having a final meeting with Lith tonight to secure the details of the trade routes and finally figure out what kind of territory I'll be venturing out to next.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2U4YTZkY2VmMjQ3OGU5ZjllOGI4NzJiMTUxMDZj" data-original-margin="">I sit with my feet up on a coffee table, and my hands behind my head, staring at the ceiling deep in thought as flashes of light continuously go off in the back portion of the room.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTk3MDgxODhmNDQ3NjA4OTY3Mjk4NDM1NjdiM2Ey" data-original-margin="">Bri's voice rings out to me after about 20 minutes and a glowing silver ring comes flying my way.</p>
<p class="cnNkZmNkOTEyMTFhYTQ2ZTBiODQ0ZGFmMDEyZWMzMGI4" data-original-margin="">"Hey, I made something for you, it's one of the highest quality items I think I've ever produced, so please accept it as a gift for helping me rank up today."</p>
<p class="cnNmODNjZmJhN2ZjMjQ5ZjdiOGM2YjUzMWI1YTY4NjUy" data-original-margin="">I use appraisal while catching the shiny silver-colored ring in my hand, while not moving any other part of my body from the comfortable couch.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmY5ODcxYzBmODQwMjRiMDc4YWQ4OGJmMzNmYmFh" data-original-margin="">Platinum Ring of Visual Manipulation [+151% Mental Strength][+111% Speed][+100% Agility][+99% Strength][+74% Defense][Illusion Attribute]</p>
<p class="cnNmNDk2NzBmOGM5YzQ4YTQ4ODM4ZmIxY2FkMmE4ZmNl" data-original-margin="">My eyes stay focused on it for a moment, and the platinum glimmer and smooth surface of the item are captivating. A bright white aura comes off the ring, and Bri continues to speak.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDg5NWVlYzEwZDRmMWU5MWQwMDg4YjdlMzk2Yzhm" data-original-margin="">"It has a light attribute imbued that should allow you to put up small walls of illusions similar to my own. Meaning you'll be able to make people around you invisible if they're close enough, even if you don't share that stealth skill with them."</p>
<p class="cnNlNDI4Y2M0ZDgyMDRhNmU4YmIwYzQxMmYwYjQ5NDE3" data-original-margin="">I smile and accept it, taking off my Platinum Amulet of Frost [+137% Mental Strength] [+90% Ice Magic Strength] to replace it with this new item with much better stats. I slip the smooth platinum ring on my finger.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDllMzIxODMwOTQyOGRhZjJhODE1ZTI3YWIzYWMw" data-original-margin="">"Thanks, I'll make good use of it."</p>
<p class="cnMyMjJhMzcxNWQyNjQwNDk5YWYxMmMzODlhMDA1M2Uz" data-original-margin="">I place my hand above me in the air and let out a much higher amount of my mana control to let the illusion attribute of the ring activate. A long 1 meter by 2 meter rectangle of shimmering mana comes out, making the ceiling above me disappear, allowing me to put whatever I'd like in its place.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWJmNDdmYzQwOTQ4MjliMGRkNjQ5NjIyNDI4NDhl" data-original-margin="">Light flashes in the back of the room as Bri continues to craft random items, and I become very entertained by changing the rectangle of ceiling that I control to look like various dungeons I've been to before.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTkyNjVlOWEwOTRiY2U4NGE1YWYwYzM4OGVkZjZk" data-original-margin="">Another 20 minutes or so go by before the sensation of someone approaching from below us hits both mine and Bri's mana senses.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2JhODFjM2Y1MDRmYTdiYzY4NzQ4OTM1NmI3ZDUz" data-original-margin="">We stop what we're doing, and I release the hush barrier just in time for a few knocks to ring out from the side door at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2QxOTUyY2RhMjRiYTViNzhlODVmYzM3YWJjOTkx" data-original-margin="">Bri looks to the back of the room, and I turn my head to face the visitor.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmY0MjEyZDExMDQwZGViMzBiMzg3NWQ3MjEwNjZl" data-original-margin="">It's Bernard. In a neatly fitted suit, thin-framed glasses, and a book still in his hand at his side, the craftswoman's assistant speaks up in a professional tone.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2ZmYjU1OWRhZDRiOGE4YjUwNTgzYTcyMTA5Njgx" data-original-margin="">"I'm very sorry to bother you in the middle of a meeting, Ms. Briana, but there's been important news from an informant that I think you'd be very interested to hear."</p>
<p class="cnM1MTVlMTU1OWMwZTRlODVhYWExNzllZjViOGM5OTUy" data-original-margin="">He looks over to me, then back at Bri, waiting for her response.</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2Y2MWU4MDc2MDRmMmY4MGUwMzkyYzdjNDdlNWVl" data-original-margin="">She nods.</p>
<p class="cnNlY2E4Y2IzZWY3YTQ3MjY5ZDJhZTFjZjUzMGExM2Fi" data-original-margin="">"Very well, this client is trusted, don't worry about keeping secrets. What is the news?"</p>
<p class="cnMyMzhlNmI0MmNiNDQ5NWE4NzI1MjA0NmI2MzA4ODEx" data-original-margin="">Bernard pauses for a moment, then blurts out something that leaves the whole room in shock.</p>
<p class="cnMxODkwNmVkZDM0NTQ3NzI4YzVhMWFhZjI0OTkyMzBm" data-original-margin="">"Well, this is directly from our informant that infiltrated the Association. There's been a violent high-grade dungeon break near the Green Ridge Mountain Lookout. It's unlike any break they've ever seen before. The energy dispersed has created 14 brand new dungeons in its place."</p>
