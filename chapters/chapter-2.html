<p class="cnMzN2Y4YzMwN2FiZjQzMmM5YjQzMWE4Yjk0N2VjMjUx" data-original-margin="">I walked up to an older looking man and asked if he'd buy my mana crystals. The going price is about 1 bronze coin per unit of mana energy. Goblin crystals coincidentally have about 1 unit of mana in them.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGQzNmM1OTFjNzQxODI5NGQ1Y2YyZDE3NWY4MjVj" data-original-margin="">The man took my two crystals and threw them on a small silver dish connected to a machine by the cash register.

As I watched the houses fly by out the window I opened up my status and saw that my HP had fully recovered overnight as well as the slash on my arm. I smiled and just stared at my status the whole trip.</p>

<p class="cnM2NGE1ZTUwNzc5ZTRlZDNhMjdmMDE2ZmFjYTA5MmNl" data-original-margin="">I followed her to a small booth area where she immediately said "smile" and took my picture.

<p class="cnM5ZmU4ZTUwYjg1YjQxMTA5OTVlZmYwZDJlM2MwMmVi" data-original-margin="">"Alright, thank you for coming in today. Please wait 5 minutes for me."</p>

<p class="cnM4NDg0NTU2NTQzNzQ3M2RiZWUzZTFhMmM3NTQ2OTMy" data-original-margin="">She went into a back room for a few minutes. I waited patiently. The woman came back out with that same blinding white smile on her face and gave me a small card.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzIyYTFjYjU3MDQ1ZTNhYTQ4YmI4ODZkYTBjODVh" data-original-margin="">It looked just like a driver's license. It had my name, my picture, the association's logo, and a large letter "E" on the top right side of the card.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTZjNmE4YWMxYTQ2MTU4ZGVkNmY2ZTUxNGMyMTY4" data-original-margin="">There is a class system for hunters. Once you're awakened you are automatically given the "E Class" appraisal. It's the most basic hunters ID you can acquire. I looked at it bright eyed.</p>

<p class="cnM5NjYwNWUzZWFlNzQ5NTY5MjQyZDgzODNiMDFmOGY5" data-original-margin="">I walked out the front door and took the train straight to "Alpine Square Park" , the stop right in front of the Alpine Square Dungeon. I got off the train and made my way over to the glowing blue portal. I muttered to myself.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDgzMmE1OWQ1ODQyMDM4M2M5YzhhYzliYTM2YWJk" data-original-margin="">"It's time."</p>
<p class="cnNhMjdhOTliM2UwODQ2MTJhYWZlNjE4YjVhZDJhM2Y2" data-original-margin="">I jumped through the portal and found myself in the very familiar grassland. I trekked forward full of confidence with my dagger drawn. I came across a goblin within minutes of my march.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDNkYzY0ZTFjMjQ5MTFiNzY4NjEzMjc3M2U1NDE5" data-original-margin="">It was a quick battle. The monster came at me but I'm much faster and agile than I was in my last battle. I swiftly slashed and dodged, then on its second charge I did it again.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTkzNDQ3YzNiMTQ4ZTU5MTZlMWUyZDYzYmJlMmJm" data-original-margin="">"Easy, bring it on"</p>
<p class="cnMxMjVmMjA1ODMxNzQ4MTBhNTJmYTUwYTViNTY0NDJk" data-original-margin="">I waited about a minute and a half catching my breath while waiting for the mana crystal to appear. I grabbed the crystal and shoved it in my back pocket. By then I heard another goblin sound 20 meters to my left.

<p class="cnNkYjUwZDI4NzFlYzQ1ZmNhNGJkODZmMGFiNjE1Y2Fl" data-original-margin="">Although my health was full, my body isn't used to this kind of battle situation. So after just 3 goblins I've become pretty fatigued. I decided to make my way back to the portal before I venture in too far. On my way back I confronted one more goblin, but it was not a problem. In two slashes the pest was taken care of, but I was definitely nearing my limit.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTRjYmM2ZWFlMDRkOGJiOTcyODdmZTQ3YjA0ZmY0" data-original-margin="">I made it out and decided to go to the market to sell my mana and eat something. After about an hour I was feeling a bit better. I was able to go back in the dungeon and defeat 3 more goblins. I didn't level up again, but I gained a lot of experience towards my future levels and fighting in the field. I got home that day and sprawled out on my bed in exhaustion. I didn't realize hunting was so tiring.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDNlMzA5NzRjMDQwMDY5YjFhMjJmNGI4ZGQyZmJm" data-original-margin="">I decided my goal for tomorrow as I drifted off into blissful sleep. I need to figure out how to use my skill.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGNlZWM4NTU3ZjQyMGE4ZDQ4NjA1MGVmYTEwYjQy" data-original-margin="">The next morning I woke up feeling as good as new. I also just remembered rent on my apartment is due in a week and a half. I either have to pay rent here or find a new place to live. It may not be a bad idea to find a place closer to the dungeon. It takes me almost an hour to walk there. I'll make sure to take a look around when I have the time. Today I'm focusing on my skill.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWRiNWVmOGZhYzQ3NjM4MWYxNzI3NTZiZWZiNDg4" data-original-margin="">When I finally made my way to the Alpine Square Dungeon entrance I took a deep breath and dove in for my second day of solo exploring.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDE5NjZiZjNkYjQyYzA4NDVlMzAzNTZiMTdiZDFl" data-original-margin="">I took it easy at first, defeating 2 goblins pretty quickly as a warm up. Then again, I heard the voice ring in my head.</p>

<p class="cnM4NTQ2ODFkZGE1ZTQ5MGRhM2QwMjlkNWQ0OGEyZTVh" data-original-margin="">I noticed that certain stats have been leveling up at different rates. They have been growing about 2-3 points per level.  It seems fighting just goblins will make it harder and harder to level up because it takes much more experience each time.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjdhYThlZWIzYzQ3YmJiNTVkYThhNzA4ZTYzMjQ0" data-original-margin="">While deep in thought I decided to do a little test. The next goblin that appeared came charging towards me, I let it cut my arm. My HP fell to 23/25. I wanted to see if while fighting this goblin I could use my skill to absorb HP for myself.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjJmYjBkNjUyNjRjYTFhODU1Mzk5OTYyOTYyNmI2" data-original-margin="">I locked my eyes on the goblin and tried to use my skill. Repeating "absorption" in my mind over and over.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjM3ZTQwY2JlMDQwOTVhNzE5OTliNTg4YWE1ODkw" data-original-margin="">I have gone to many events where famous hunters explain their skills, this is how they all say they use them. So it must be the same for me.</p>
<p class="cnM4NTUzMzA3MDI0ZDQwNjU5YmViZjY3Zjg0ZWI2NTI2" data-original-margin="">Nothing happened. I tried over and over, dodging attacks and repeating "absorption" again and again in my mind until I just started yelling it out loud too. I tried making contact with the goblin as well, I thought maybe I needed to be touching the target to absorb HP. Again, nothing. </p>
<p class="cnNmMGNlY2ZkNTVhYzQzMjk4YjVkYTUwNTRiM2Q0ZTFm" data-original-margin="">Lastly, I repeated my skills name as I slashed the goblin 2 times. Nothing. My HP was still at 23/25, and my MP was staying still at 25/25. I was beginning to get a little tired and pretty annoyed. I made my way back to the dungeon exit gate and fought 2 more goblins trying all kinds of possible variations. Still, no luck.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDA2MzcwMmM2ZDQwYzk4NTE4NGIxZTliZWY5MmNm" data-original-margin="">I stepped out of the gate with 5 goblin mana crystals and all of a sudden realized what the problem may be... I said in a hushed voice.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDA2ZGY2MTk3NDQ4MzhiMTA2M2I0MmY5MjIxOWEz" data-original-margin="">"What if it's MP absorption..?"</p>
<p class="cnMxZTc3NzA5NDQ0NTRjMjA4OTExYzc1OThkM2Q1YWJh" data-original-margin="">As it dawned on me I was pretty disappointed, but it also wasn't the end of the world.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2ZlOTA2NTk4YjRjZWRhNjE0OGFiYWJhMTczYjg3" data-original-margin="">MP is used up when a skill is used. If my skill is for MP absorption it can only be used when my MP isn't full. The only way to deplete my MP is to use a skill.... So there lies my problem. I basically don't have a skill.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjdjYTYzOGJhMzRiMjhiYTg1NGRkYmJiMWVhNGIy" data-original-margin="">I slowly walked to the village center and cashed in my 5 mana crystals for 5 bronze coins. I bought a big sandwich at one of the local shops to replenish some energy and really think about my situation.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjlkZGQ1NjkyMTRiM2Q4NTFlOTgyNWM1ZWRiYzQ3" data-original-margin="">When people are awakened about half of them receive a skill(1/2 people). Some of the most common skills are body hardening, swordsmanship, and Speed Boosts. These are all basic traits that will boost a stat or help in combat. There are also rare skills like healing magic, HP/MP recovery, and various types of combat magic(fire,water,wind,earth,ice,ect...). These rare skills awaken in about 1/20 people.<br>Then there are unique skills, it's rather rare but not impossible. About 1/1000 people have a unique skill, one that has never been reported before.</p>
<p class="cnM3OThjYWM5ZGMyZTRmYjU4MTJiZjY5NWRlM2UyN2Jm" data-original-margin="">There have also been cases of hunters having more than one skill. About 1/100 hunters have 2 skills. Having 2 skills is rare, but not to unheard of in the hunting community. Usually hunters with 2 skills rise up through the ranks much quicker, so a higher percent of the top hunters have 2 skills. It's rumored that a hunter could have more than 2, but there's nobody in the public eye with 3 or more skills so It's still just a rumor.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjhkNTkxMDhkZDQzNGY5MWY0NDVhNmMyMWM5ODEx" data-original-margin="">My skill would have been perfect if I had a good second skill. I could replenish my MP and use another skill unlimited times. What a waste.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTQzZmFkMmI5ZjRjOWI4NTg3MDcyZGJlOTNiNDFk" data-original-margin="">I decided to do a bit more testing the second half of the day but had no luck. I defeated 5 more goblins and stayed at level 4. I traded my 5 mana for bronze coins and walked home. I was kind of bummed out that my skill was a bust but there's nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2UwMDZlOThhNDQxMThhZmNiZjk3ZjIxMzVjZDEx" data-original-margin="">I just have to level up and get stronger. For the rest of the week I dove into the dungeon every day. After 7 days straight of grinding goblins I was able to level up 4 more times.</p>

<p class="cnM5OTdiMGJiNDJmNzQ2YzI4MjMwNGUxZjkyMzY4NDU2" data-original-margin="">That last level up took me over 25 goblins to achieve. I am definitely getting stronger, and I'm able to stay in the dungeon to fight for much longer as well. I can defeat most goblins in 1 slash, but it's getting harder and harder to level up each time. Also my walk to and from the dungeon every morning and night is really starting to get to be a hassle. I think it's a good idea to move in to an apartment closer to the dungeon and the village center.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2VkNGJhNDhjNzQ2MzhiNDQ2MjMwZDljMWFkN2Rj" data-original-margin="">Over the next week I continued hunting everyday and moved into a new apartment managed by an old man named Mr. Winser. He seemed nice, but for some reason was never in a good mood. Rent here is 2 silver coins a month. If I hunt and and save about 7 bronze coins a day(210 in 30 days), everything over that will be profit. It's a bit more pricey than my old place, but it's definitely worth it. I can easily survive on 5-10 bronze a day for meals, I just hope I don't need much new gear. If I can make 15-20 bronze a day on average I should be fine.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjNmNWUzNTNlYjQ5NjA5NjRkYTg2MzM0ZTY3MmI4" data-original-margin="">Now that I live close to the dungeon life is a bit easier, but my level has only gone up by 2 during this full week of hunting.</p>
