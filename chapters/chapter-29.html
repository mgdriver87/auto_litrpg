<p class="cnM0M2Y1MzIwNDg0YTQ0ZmFiN2Q3NTYwZjMzYWU5YTJk" data-original-margin="">Pretty similar to my own level. That's good.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDI1ODdlMDcyNDQ3NWE5NTIwZjIxMGI3ZWJiY2Fm" data-original-margin="">The rushing stream was to my left and a slight incline leading up the side of the valley was on my right.</p>
<p class="cnM1Mjc1M2VkNmMxOTQwMjNhN2M1NWM5NTMzMWM1NmEy" data-original-margin="">I put my sword out in front of me and rushed towards the monster with no intention of actually making contact with it this time around.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmU2ZWMxNjAyMjQyYWY5MjZmNjJmNGUwMjNmZjVm" data-original-margin="">We both sprinted towards each other getting closer and closer. Once we were less than 10m apart I could smell a foul scent, this beast smelled worse than any monster I'd ever encountered.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2YwMDc1NGUwOTQ3N2Y4ZjgzZDIwY2Y0YWE0YTQy" data-original-margin="">I instantly lunged to the right and ran up the side of the valley to avoid the monster's attack.</p>

<p class="cnM0YTc2N2RmYTI2ZjQ5MGE4Yzk3MWZlNGI2NzRhMzQy" data-original-margin="">The cyclops kept running forward in a perfect straight line. It swung its club at me, but I was already well outside of its range. I'm mumbled to myself.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmJlNWI0N2M5YzQzZTU4MTk0N2RlOWFkZDE5MWYw" data-original-margin="">"Interesting."</p>
<p class="cnMyMWY5ZjMyZjk1ZjRmOGI5NDAwMDE3MjA1Yzk3NzAw" data-original-margin="">I grinned and ran back towards the water and flatter ground. The cyclops turned to me and locked its eye on me again. We both charged towards each other.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDZjM2M2MGNmYzRjNDY4Y2NkNWM3ZDFhZDc0MDFm" data-original-margin="">At the last second I dodged it again running up the mountain as the giant club narrowly missed me. The monster kept running forward in a perfect straight line.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWY5MzdjMjAxNzQyMWZiNjkyMDM2NTA2Yjc4MjBl" data-original-margin="">It looks like this monster has equal, if not greater speed than me... but it can't change directions very quickly.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGM5OTY3NDFiZDQ2ODJiY2JhM2MyYWE5OWY2YTEx" data-original-margin="">That's one up side. I'll possibly be able to use my agility to outsmart this beast.</p>
<p class="cnNhMmU0ODQyNGQ4ZjQ3NTFiZjkwMzQ3YzM1ZGFlMGYy" data-original-margin="">The big problem is the monster's club. Even when I dodged, the cyclops' timing was basically perfect. One second earlier and I would have been hit. It definitely has good intuition, and is VERY strong. That club is over 2m long and looks like it's make out of a very heavy metal. It can swing it with ease like a baseball bat.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGFhY2YxMDIyYzRmZmRiZGIyNWJlMTc0YTQ1ZTdi" data-original-margin="">Let's see how this beast likes flames.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDZjNzY3ZjI3ZjQzMjA5NmJlMzk0ZjhhNzBmZThl" data-original-margin="">I ran back down to flat ground and ignited into a fire ball as we both began our charge. The cyclops didn't seem to hesitate at all. It was the same result. I had to dodge at the last minute to avoid the trajectory of its club. That weapon is a great offensive tool, but it doubles as a defensive shield.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTcyYWVjNDllMjRhZjJiY2FhM2RjMWRlZmVkMTA1" data-original-margin="">This is going to be tougher than I thought.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmQzYjVhYzllNDRkYmE4OGIyMWFhNDc3ZWZlOGI1" data-original-margin="">I decided to change up my strategy. I charged towards the monster from up above it on the valley's incline. I fully engulfed my body in flames I jumped in the air with my sword in full swing launching an attack. The cyclops countered with a swing of its club.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzhkY2I4MDUwYTQ0MTZhNjQ4NWQ5MzY3OWIwY2Iw" data-original-margin="">"CLANGGGGGGG"</p>
<p class="cnMzNmVhZjUxY2ExMjQzNjg4MzUxYWZhZTdhNzc0Y2Jl" data-original-margin="">Sparks fly and flames shoot from our clash of metal. At first it felt like an even exchange, but I was so wrong.</p>

<p class="cnMzZDZlNTQwNjEyMTRhOWE5NGNmZDljMDZhOTQ3Mjky" data-original-margin="">It roared as I was thrown forward. I hit the rocky ground and looked up to see the monsters massive legs charging towards me.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTVmNzdlMDJmNTQ0NDM5Zjg0MGEwMzMzNmQxMWQ2" data-original-margin="">With every fast twitch muscle fiber in my body I managed to jump and spin out of the way as the beast cracked the ground as it rumbled past my head less than a meter away.</p>
<p class="cnMwODY4ZmY4OWNiMzQ2YjJiMzJmMjIwOTFiNDIwZjIy" data-original-margin="">I spit out a mouthful of dirt and got to my feet. In this moment of adrenaline induced clarity I saw an opening. I was right behind the cyclops as it was trying to turn around.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGIyMDYyMjY5NTQyZGI5NmE0NzdkZGMyZWZhOTc2" data-original-margin="">I pictured every encounter we had so far. The battle highlights flashed before my eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGNiOTkxZmY0MjQ0YmRiZWFhYjQ0ZGE5ZGM5ODc2" data-original-margin="">There's a fraction of a second that the monster has to stop moving and adjust its positioning before charging again.

<p class="cnMzMjQ1ZDI4OTc1YjRjNGZiMmEyNzEzYWM4ODY5MjQx" data-original-margin="">I erupted into flames.</p>
<p class="cnMxYmY0Mzk2YzYzYTQ2NDFiYTQyMTBlYjdhYWQxZjFj" data-original-margin="">As the cyclops turned I focused all the fire magic into my blade and went for an all or nothing attack.</p>

<p class="cnNkOGYyMmIzMDYzMTQyOWI5OTQ4N2E5MDg0NjFlMjk3" data-original-margin="">I made a huge firey slash across the monsters back. It cried out in pain.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWYwMGFhZDcwZDQ4MTJiNzg1NWM4ZjlhOTY1MmUy" data-original-margin="">The monster was hurt, but our battle was far from over. The cyclops snarled and charged back at me with its club raised.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjE0MTFjNjA4YzQzMWQ5ZTRmZjE2YWE5OGI5ODRl" data-original-margin="">I waited and stared at the enormous creature bellowing towards me. It swung its massive club with a loud roar.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDM4MWJiMWI2YTRmNzhiMmFhZWRiNzBhOTUxMDJi" data-original-margin="">In that same moment I shifted my stance and aligned myself perfectly for a counterattack. I swung my blade at the club hoping to use it as a bounce pad.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWI1ZjZiY2MzMDQwN2ViMjU2ODBlNGIxOGVkOGMw" data-original-margin="">I used the incoming club's momentum to throw myself to the ground. I let the monster hit me while strategically angling my sword to position my fall away from the monster's heavy feet.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDk5YTFhMmNjZTRjMWY5Y2ZiNzIxZjc2ODc0N2E4" data-original-margin="">"CLANGGGG"</p>
<p class="cnMzNGE2NjJiYmNhMzQzODliNDZjMDBkZWRkZDQ4ZGI5" data-original-margin="">Sparks flew and I was thrown to the ground as the cyclops stomped on by. I immediately erupted into flames and lunged towards the wide open backside of the monster.</p>

<p class="cnMzOTY2MjhkZDI4OTQwMzI4YmMyYmEzZWY4ZGQ4ZWIx" data-original-margin="">I landed another hit. There was a fiery "X" on the monster's back. It was bleeding heavily, and the magic fire residue was burning bright. Jack had told me these Cyclops have a minor weakness to fire, maybe the leftover magic was doing some significant extra damage.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2RhMDZhNjE0YzRhZTBhMzRkNzQ4MmExY2U4MjNk" data-original-margin="">After a series of pain filled cries the cyclops faced me with a murderous glare. It charged forward grunting and dripping blood. Its speed had changed, this charge was definitely slower than the last.</p>
<p class="cnNhODU4MmVmOGMyNDQzMmY5NDljNTgwYTk2ZmZjODI1" data-original-margin="">I went for the same movement. I let the monster smack me to the ground while blocking most of the attack with my blade. The beast fell for it a 3rd time.</p>
<p class="cnM0Zjk4Mjk5NjFmZjQzMTBhZjhlNjFhYTQ0NTc1NTU4" data-original-margin="">Without hesitation I concentrated all my flames into the top of my blade and sprinted towards the monsters back. I yelled as I jumped through the air.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTA3ODc3ZjY2NTRiZGE5YmQzNGViNTBlMjMxMWNk" data-original-margin="">"THIS IS THE END FOR YOU!"</p>
<p class="cnM3MmVmZWM2YjI1YjRjNTliZDM5M2E3YTA5ZDMxYmY3" data-original-margin="">I stabbed the cyclops deep in the back of the head. It let out a cry of agony.</p>

<p class="cnM2ZjRhZDRhYzgxZTQ0YzliNzZjODI0Y2JiNzQ0YTli" data-original-margin="">I held on on tight releasing as much fire magic as I could into the creature. It struggled and cried but quickly came to its end. This was a very effective attack.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzQ5NjQwOWRiZjQ3ZjBiMjdjNDNjNDczMzI1OWEw" data-original-margin="">With a final burst of flames the cyclops fell to its knees.</p>

<p class="cnNkYjRiZDY4MjhhNzRkNWM4ZGYzMWQ3OTQzMzQyYjk4" data-original-margin="">It dropped its club and fell to the rocky ground moments later.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2Y2NmFiZDU3MzQxZTZhNjRlM2IwMjFhMTEyMWJk" data-original-margin="">I gripped my sword and pointed it to the sky smiling and admiring my work.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmU0OTJjZjk1ZjQ1ZjViZjhlZDJmMDRlZjE1M2Ey" data-original-margin="">It felt great to defeat a new monster by myself without any higher level instructors or guides around.</p>

<p class="cnMzNTRhYzM0YmM4NzQ1MzdiY2UzOTMxNjRhZWUxOWFm" data-original-margin="">Moments later the cyclops completely disappeared and dropped a large mana crystal. I tossed it up and down in my left hand before placing it in the item box.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZThiOWE3MWIyMzRlMmNhOTc3Mzc3ZDk3NmI5OGYy" data-original-margin="">I walked back down to the flowing water and washed my face and arms in the stream. I was covered in small scratches and dirt after that fight, it got pretty brutal.</p>
<p class="cnM2M2RkMTM4MDk5YjRlNmE4ZmE0N2I4YWNiODg4NWNh" data-original-margin="">I drank a potion that restored my MP back to full. I stretched my arms and pulled my sword out as I ventured off following the steady water source deeper into the dungeon.</p>
