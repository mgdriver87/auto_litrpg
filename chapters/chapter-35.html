                <p class="cnNkZjE2OWZlNzAwZTRlMjk4NWVkMjFjMTVlMDk5MjBl" data-original-margin="">The main road was filled with independent street vendors.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWUzMmZlMGQyNDQ0MGY4YzRlZTc4YjY5NzZmYTlk" data-original-margin="">We walked for about 10 minutes in the direction of the city's center.</p>
<p class="cnM0Njg5OTdiYjg3YTRjMWM4MjQ3M2QxODQxNTY5YTk2" data-original-margin="">It became very clear to me that most of the shops around the train station were mostly for tourists and small time hunters.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmM0ZWVlYmM2NjQ4ZWU5NDhiZWIwY2ZjMTYxYTlj" data-original-margin="">It was filled with scammers and con men. What can you really expect? Business is business. That's the way the world works.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjIzN2UzOGVjODQyODliMzM0ZmZmZTZhOTlkM2Qy" data-original-margin="">As we walked further in, there were less people out on the streets. The buildings became much taller, it looked like they were mostly allocated for office space.</p>
<p class="cnNmOWYwMjM5M2I5MDQ1OGQ5NmEwNWNmNGM3MzY5OThj" data-original-margin="">We turned a street corner and I saw a massive mall. There were escalators that connected at least 10 floors of shopping areas. The floors were a smooth white color and the walls connecting each new floor were made of a thick clear glass. The curved silver steel beams that held everything together were incorporated into the building design. It looked very futuristic.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTBlODg0MWEzNzQxN2FiMWFlOTIyZDgzMzc5NjNm" data-original-margin="">We took an escalator up to the 6th floor. Maria and I were fascinated by the scenery.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTk0ZDgwNWUwOTQ5ZTA4MmY0ZDA4ZTdhMzYxMGQy" data-original-margin="">The shops sold mana crystals, swords, armor, shields, and much more.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2RmNWMwMTQwYTRlYmM4Mjc5YWI2YzdhNDRhM2Fj" data-original-margin="">People here were a lot more civilized and dressed much nicer than the town market. This must be the designer district. Higher class items are sold here. Makes sense.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjJlNDZiNDIwODRjZDVhN2I2M2M4ZTVlYjQxMGYy" data-original-margin="">As we arrived to the 6th floor Rei motioned for us to get off the moving stairs and to follow her.</p>
<p class="cnMyNWM3Njk1ZDAwNzQ1ODY5MTU4MDkwMTk3MjNjYTc3" data-original-margin="">We walked along a balcony with a clear glass barrier. There was an open hole in the center of the mall, it was doughnut shaped. Looking up there was a blue sky, looking downwards we could see the bottom floor. It's an incredible building.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDRhYWM4OGQxZTQwMTA4MGI0MThlMmJkZGUxN2Mw" data-original-margin="">We kept walking along the balcony until a large storefront came into view. It seemed to be a separate shopping area closed off by a white wall, I couldn't see inside.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODkxMjNlMjFhODRlNzk4MzJhOTkzM2UyOTlmZDYz" data-original-margin="">Rei talked to a security guard outside and showed him a card. The guard nodded and opened the door.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjczMzUyZTU2MDQ3OGJiYjdjNDFmMGE4ZDJlOWEy" data-original-margin="">We walked in.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGZiYzM5NjE4MDRkZGZiZjU0ODllOGRhMmM3OWIy" data-original-margin="">It was a large shopping center with organized gear on each wall and display tables. Rei spoke up.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDliNDY2YWM4MDQwMWZhYWJhZWQyZWE1NmYyZDQ0" data-original-margin="">"Alright, give me about 30 minutes. Im going to stock up on gear for the guild."</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWRlYmM0MjRhMjQ4MWU4ZGMyYzg4NGYyYjViMGQy" data-original-margin="">Maria and I nodded.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGFiYmIyNDg1ZTRhNmZiMWE5YWU4YTRmZmZmOTVl" data-original-margin="">I overheard a few employees and some of Rei's previous conversation.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzJmNTFlYjAyODRmZmJhMzk5MjI2ZDZlNTdmYWIx" data-original-margin="">This seems to be a high end magical item store, but its customer base is exclusively bulk buyers from guilds.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmZlMjNjMWU1NjQyODM5NWUxM2Q4ZTcxZmU2YjRj" data-original-margin="">They must offer good deals.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTNiOGE5YTc4MTQ2OTE5MjczODlkYWIwZmI1OGFi" data-original-margin="">Maria and I wandered around the store looking at all the equipment.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWQ4YmM1ZTRiYTQxM2Q5MjNjMmQ1Y2FlOTMzMGVk" data-original-margin="">There were display tables full of potions and interesting looking stones and items.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGE1NjgwMmM5NzQ2NDM4ODJmNWFiNzI1MjI0Zjkw" data-original-margin="">I saw a wall completely covered in glistening silver swords.</p>
<p class="cnM4OWQ0Y2QxYjE2NzQwYzI5NTMxMWE1MzVhMWQzOTgw" data-original-margin="">There was even an accessory table that had all kinds of rings, bracelets, and necklaces with a variety of attributes.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTI4ZGNiYzhiZTQ1NWZhZWM1NDM5YmQ0NjBlYWE3" data-original-margin="">There is nothing like this back home. The capital is amazing!</p>
<p class="cnNlYmM5M2E3NjUyOTQ1YzRiYjQ1MzBkMTkzYmIwMWQ3" data-original-margin="">Maria's was mesmerized as well.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzMzODhiZmUyMTQ3NmM4OTgzMTVmMjFkOWFiYzM0" data-original-margin="">It all seemed to be high grade E and D Class gear. There wasn't much here that was mind blowing. It was just the fact that there was so much of it in one place. I assume there are other shops with higher grade gear, but it wouldn't be worth the guild's money to buy those in bulk.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTliMzNmMmJhYTRjYjQ4YjY3Y2M3NjVkZjdjZGJm" data-original-margin="">"Alright. That didn't take too long did it?"</p>
<p class="cnMzNDRhYTY2N2NkZDQzNDk4NzAzOTUzYTg2YjhlODU2" data-original-margin="">Rei came over to us while tightening a large leather pouch around her waist.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjhiY2Y3ZTNmZTQ0ZGU5ZWM1MzFmODM2OTY4YzEx" data-original-margin="">I raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWI4ZmRiMGFmODQ1MDRiZWI4OWEzMTM3MGE3YTMy" data-original-margin="">"That's an item box right? It looks a lot bigger than mine? How much can it carry?"</p>
<p class="cnM1NGU4Y2EwNWVlYTQ1MzZhNDI2MGNkMjBmNzRiZTMz" data-original-margin="">She grinned.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzBmYTYyMDE1ZjQ5ZGI5MWRjNzRiZGEwZTgzY2Yx" data-original-margin="">"You're right. It's a lower grade C Class item box. Holds up to 100 items. I filled it to the brim. We have enough swords and potions to last a few months."</p>
<p class="cnMzZThiMjU0MDY4MDRjN2RhMzRlZDgwNjVjMTBhYzRj" data-original-margin="">I nodded.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2RiNThhZTExNTQ3MWQ4ZGRhODhmYjgzNDkyYTE5" data-original-margin="">"Wow. Good to know."</p>
<p class="cnNkYzc4YmU0YWQ5NjQ3ZTRhMTBhZmM5NmE2YTIwODVk" data-original-margin="">Maria interrupted.</p>
<p class="cnNlZmI2YzEzMTMxNjQyYjU5MDc5YTk4YjJhNTYyY2Vi" data-original-margin="">"Hey! Now that we got the guild's shopping out of the way where can we go to that shop? I want to get that sword you told me about. It's here right??"</p>
<p class="cnMzZjU4NDJhYTYwMzQzMGQ5ZWUyMTVkZWUxOTA4ZTRh" data-original-margin="">Rei nodded.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2Y3NDMxMmYxMTRhMmRiNjNjNGJkNjdjNGQyNTQ1" data-original-margin="">I looked to Maria with a bit of confusion.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWVlYjhkOTU4MzRlMTE4ZDBlZTcyZGQ4MTNkZGVh" data-original-margin="">"A Sword? You're able to handle a sword now? I remember the last time you tried to carry mine, the floor nearly broke!"</p>
<p class="cnM4MTAyN2VlNThjMTQwM2RiNDBmOWIxYThjNjc0MWM2" data-original-margin="">Maria went a bit red in the face.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTI4YTM5YmEzMjQ2YTdiNzkzOGI1ZDYwNDIzNzA4" data-original-margin="">"I can actually! Rei said there are light weight swords here, they will be perfect with my ice magic."</p>
<p class="cnM3NjJmMDllYTIwYjQ4YjE5MjQ3ZjllNWQwNThkNmY0" data-original-margin="">"Oh yeah? A special sword shop? Let's go check it out. I need to find something new as well."</p>
<p class="cnM5OTE5MTQwNTc5NDQ2ZjE5ZjdkY2U5OWE0NTY1MDY0" data-original-margin="">Rei interjected.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDE2ZWY3ZTQxZjQ1Y2M4ZjhjZWIzMzJhYmQzNGRl" data-original-margin="">"Okay. Follow me, its on the 8th floor."</p>
<p class="cnM4MmY5YWRhMGE0YjQ0OGU5Y2EzZDhkMjRjYzY1ZDZi" data-original-margin="">We followed.</p>
<p class="cnM5YmJmMjA3OWJlOTRjODliYjNiZDBlODI1NTI0Nzkw" data-original-margin="">After 2 escalator rides that took about 5 minutes we made it to floor 8.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjUxYjY5NTRhZDRmYmQ4ZTA3NTJiZGFhNzRmYzAz" data-original-margin="">There were quite a few people on this floor. All the shops were open to the public and many items were out on display.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzI5YzFmMjM0YTQ4N2RiZmYxY2E5OGQxN2M4YmNj" data-original-margin="">We walked over to a shop with tall glass doors and were greeted by a woman in a suit and tie. An odd sight, but it wasn't too out of place here I guess.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjI0NWQ2ZGQxMzQ3Y2Q5MWU3NDhkZTNjNWY3OTUx" data-original-margin="">"Welcome to Apollo's Sword Shop. May I see your Hunter's Licenses."</p>
<p class="cnM1NTdlZDQzMTA4NzRkYTlhNzJmMDIzZGEwYjliN2Q0" data-original-margin="">We handed her our cards and she escorted us to a counter with dozens of silver swords behind it.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTI4YjViMTlhNTQwODliYTVlZmI3NTU2NDE0OTM1" data-original-margin="">"We have an E, D, and a C Class here. Get them what they need."</p>
<p class="cnNkZWI5YWE5M2IxYTRkN2E5ZTNkZmMwNzE5MzM1OWQz" data-original-margin="">She spoke to a man behind the counter wearing a suit identical to hers. His eyes perked up.</p>
<p class="cnNkNGM0MDk2NDJiNDQzMDRhNTBjNjc5ZWEzZjI4ZjNj" data-original-margin="">"Who needs a sword? What can I do for you?"</p>
<p class="cnMyYTYxMWNjMTZlZjQ4Mzg4MDQ0MzRjY2UzMWQ4M2Ux" data-original-margin="">Maria and I both raised a hand. I spoke up.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTkzODg2MWQ0MDQxNDViYmNiYzk2NDMwMGEwNTRm" data-original-margin="">"Both of us, but take care of her first. I'll look around the shop."</p>
<p class="cnM5ODQ4YmRjYjhlYTQyZGY4YmEwYTQ4ZDJlNmQwMjY0" data-original-margin="">He nodded and started asking Maria a ton of questions. I zoned out of the conversation and started eyeing a few swords in the nearby display cases.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDVmYjE3MDkzYzRiODU4YjViMGUwZDQzYjBkZjVm" data-original-margin="">I needed a good replacement sword, but I don't have the money to get anything too crazy. I reached in my item box and counted what I had, the total was 43 silver. I left a good amount at home, I didn't want to blow my whole savings.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWU0Nzc3YWRiZTRjNDRhOGJkMGE5YTFiOWNhMzYw" data-original-margin="">This can get me a good sword. I remembered back to the auction, I can probably get something with a 100-150 strength stat. That's all I'm looking for. It'll be a good upgrade from my last sword, but its better that I don't get too attached to my weapons. They do break...</p>
<p class="cnM0NGM5ZGRjYWI2NzRlNGJiOTA2NDlmNTg3MTU3NDQx" data-original-margin="">There were clear markings on the walls showing what the range of stats on different items in display cases held. I could tell there were private rooms in the back too, that must be where their VIP customers make expensive deals. Interesting.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjc4Y2Q0ZGMwNzRmOTRhYzhmYTBiMjQ1MjNlNjgy" data-original-margin="">I came upon a D Rank Long Sword display case.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWQxNDJjNzQyYjRjYzU5MjI2OTA0MGRhMGZiNzMx" data-original-margin="">A shining silver sword with a black handle caught my eye.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTkzZjRlMzJjZDQ4MWY4ODFlOTM0Mjg3ZTMwODgy" data-original-margin="">A younger man caught me eyeing it.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWNhMmU3NTkxYTQwNWVhYWI1MjljZmYxNjA2YmRk" data-original-margin="">"Hey! My name's Marco! That's a nice sword you're looking at. It has a 125 strength boost, I can sell it to you for 30 silver.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDI3YzM0NWVlYjRkNWVhZWY5ZWQzOWQzYTBhYTA2" data-original-margin="">"Can I hold it?"</p>
<p class="cnM3N2M2NGQ5ZjA1YTQ1NzhhNjE3ODRhNjhiYmJlOTU0" data-original-margin="">"Yeah sure. Just know, if ya break it ya buy it."</p>
<p class="cnNhOGY5ZjI5MzgxNzQzZjg5NDRkNjdhY2I3NDdiN2Zh" data-original-margin="">I chucked.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDU4MjAyZjhiZDRiMTBhZGRjODc2ZjQ2YjkxZTlk" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, yeah."</p>
<p class="cnMxMDc0ZGE3YmM5NjQ0OThiYjJiMjA2ZjBhMDExY2Q5" data-original-margin="">The man handed me the sword off the wall and I gave it a good feel.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTgxYjdmMDk2MzQ2MTliOTVmNjBhNDU5NmE5MGJl" data-original-margin="">It was heavier than my last sword, but I could instantly feel the strength upgrade surging through me. This sword has some strong magic. I like it.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmNjYjVhMDE0NTQxOTVhMTc0MjQ2NGQxZWZlYjc0" data-original-margin="">"Give me it for 25, it's a decent sword."</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWRiNmU0ZDc0NjRjNDQ4Y2E1N2JlZWNmYzUwYzM5" data-original-margin="">The man grinned. He knew I was hooked.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDgxMDAzYmJmYTRlYzE5NmJiMTlkODUxZDcwNjUw" data-original-margin="">"Ahhh so you're the bartering type. You from out of town or what?"</p>
<p class="cnM0NDg5MTlmMjE3ODRlMGNhOWE5NmVhYjAxYTE1MjEz" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, came in this morning. It's my first time in the city. Well, at least first time in a while. So, 25?"</p>
<p class="cnMzZjFmNTM4MThjYzRiNjBhYjk2NzIwN2M5NjZmNjkz" data-original-margin="">The man shook his head.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWQwZGM0NTBmODRlNjliNTVkODJlNTQwYTE5ZjI5" data-original-margin="">"28. I can bring it down 2 sliver that's it."</p>
<p class="cnNlNjkzNGY1ZGU3OTQyNWY4YTA4YzA2NmVmYjg5ODEz" data-original-margin="">"Come on, i need it closer to 25. How about 26? That's all I have on me. I need to get lunch later ya know."</p>
<p class="cnNmOGNlOTJmYmMyMDQxOTVhNWUxNjY5YTUzZTIwZmI3" data-original-margin="">Clearly a lie, but that's how you barter. He knows it too.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzJlMGVmNDZhNDQwZjQ5OGIwY2ExNTQ4MmVhOTBm" data-original-margin="">"27. That's the lowest I can go. With a sword like this you can kill your own lunch."</p>
<p class="cnNlMjU0ZjJkMDczZjRjZmZhY2E5Y2Q5ODA0NDI2NTg4" data-original-margin="">"Fine. 27, but I want a nice sheath with it too. Black to match the handle."</p>
<p class="cnMxNTJjNTBmZDNkMDQwMzc5NGEyYjU2OTQ0MzdkYjNm" data-original-margin="">"Deal."</p>
<p class="cnM1OWEyMThlODFkYTQ1MjE4YWVmZWU1N2NlZjU2ZDAz" data-original-margin="">"Great."</p>
<p class="cnNiYjU0ZDgwZGNmZDRhZjE4ODhjYmI0NTExNWJmMzQx" data-original-margin="">We shook on it and the man went over to a nearby display case to find a sheath. I counted out 27 silver and had it out on the table before he got back.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjYzZGY1NzM3NTQ5Y2FhZmJkN2RjYjhjZjJlNzk5" data-original-margin="">We completed the deal just like that. I nodded to the man again and put my new sword on my back.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDJkYzBmOTBhODQ2NzY5MTljN2ZlMTAwZTNlMzIx" data-original-margin="">That was easy, didn't need to search around too much. I got what I needed.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmVkMWM3YTZjNjRjMDVhZTZmZWNiMTljMzhlYjY4" data-original-margin="">I walked back over to where I left Maria. There were about half a dozen sword laid out on the tabled.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDRkOWJlNzZlZjQxMGM5OTY2NmU1NWEyZTllNjlm" data-original-margin="">Maria had a look of concentration on her face. She was clearly having trouble deciding which one to get.</p>
<p class="cnNlY2QxZjQwOWNjNzRmMWVhNWFmMWQyYTQ5NzgyZjc3" data-original-margin="">This is the difference between men and women shopping. It makes me go crazy sometimes.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzBlMzI2OTNiZDQ1MzE5NzUyODc5NDgwM2MzMWM3" data-original-margin="">I watched Maria pick up each of the 6 swords at least 10 more times and swing them around.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODQ5ZTZmM2JjYzRiZGY5M2MwMjQyZmQxOGY4MDFi" data-original-margin="">Almost 20 minutes went by. I was just happy to be out and about, it didn't bug me too much today. She can take all the take she wants.</p>
<p class="cnM4ODUwODJhZTMzNjQ4NGU5NDFiNzA5ZDY1YjU1ZWZj" data-original-margin="">"Alright. I think I like this one. I'll take it!"</p>
<p class="cnMwMWE5YzY2YTBjYTQwYjFiOGY3ZDdlZGNkN2E1OTQ4" data-original-margin="">Maria finally picked out a sword. She stood holding a long and thin silver sword. When she swung it, there wasn't even the slightest sound. It seems to be a custom made sword.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWYyYmViMTMzYjQ5NDI4Njc4Yjg1YzA1NWFkYWU2" data-original-margin="">"That will be 10 silver."</p>
<p class="cnMxNjhiNDYwZTQyNTQ4OWNhN2ZiM2NmYzcyZDc4Zjll" data-original-margin="">The salesman looked at her and smiled. Maria reached into her small bag and pulled out a few silver coins.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjE1MmZjMmIyZTQ0MzI5MTM1Mjk4NDBjZjA5NWMx" data-original-margin="">"There you go! Thanks!"</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDUwNWRmYWU3ZDQxODFiYTAwZTQ3NzQ0YWFjZTgy" data-original-margin="">She purchased a white sheath as well. With an agile movement she slung the sword over her back. The three of us started walking out of the store.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2JlZmY2MjNlMjQ3YjFiYWEzNTcyNTA2YWEzNTMw" data-original-margin="">She didn't even try to haggle the price down. Whatever works for her I guess. There was one thing I was curious about.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWJjMDAzMWE3MzQzNjNiZGMyYWYyYjYyNmJhODhk" data-original-margin="">"Hey Maria! Where do you make your money? That's an expensive sword for an E Class."</p>
<p class="cnNkNGRjM2ZkYmVmYjRiN2I5M2MwNGZhYjRiYTRiYTdi" data-original-margin="">She smiled.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDM5MzYxZmNkOTRiMGM5N2Y3Yjk2MGNkMTAzZWFj" data-original-margin="">"Pace has been paying me for dungeon diving lately. I've been saving up!"</p>
<p class="cnM4MzBkMTY5M2FmYzRkYWNhNmYxOTQxNjhlNTY1NTM5" data-original-margin="">"Pace pays you???"</p>
<p class="cnNmNWQxMjc4ZGFlMjRlZWQ5YzBlYWM5NWU5ZTJlYzIw" data-original-margin="">She looked confused.</p>
<p class="cnM1MmVmYTE1Y2I3ODQxNGJiMGY3NTA3YmFjMjBhN2Nm" data-original-margin="">"Y-Yeah. I have an exclusive student contract. They're obligated to pay me."</p>
<p class="cnMwMjc2MmE5N2E1NzQxYzJhYzZiMDg2NjY2NTRhMzE0" data-original-margin="">I thought for a moment. I guess exclusive contracts with a salary would make sense. I don't get paid because I never even asked to...</p>
<p class="cnMwZmU3YjQ5NmVjNDRjYmViMGUxZjhiZTkyOThiOTIy" data-original-margin="">"Ahhh okay. Makes sense."</p>
<p class="cnMxZmJiMzVjY2QyNzRmOTg4ODUyNjBkMGQwZWNmYTIw" data-original-margin="">We walked out the front door of the store and Rei stopped in front of us.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjFkYmRiN2ZmOTQ4NjhiNjY4ZDI2ZmM0YjBjODYz" data-original-margin="">"Do you two want to test out those new weapons?"</p>
<p class="cnMwNmM4MTFkY2ZjNjRiNjhiYmZjNTkwMzVhMWZmMDhh" data-original-margin="">Maria and I looked at each other. We shrugged and nodded eagerly.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGZmNWRkZjEyZTQ1OGY5ZTQ2NTAwYjQ1ZWQwOTZi" data-original-margin="">Rei grinned.</p>
<p class="cnMxZTI0MTE2NzQwMTRiYzFiMzNhYjBmMDczMTYwYmZh" data-original-margin="">"Follow me. I know just the place to put those blades to use. This is going to be fun."</p>
<p class="cnNlNjJiYWJkMzhlZjQzMzg5YzlmYzA1MjEwOWNmNzlj" data-original-margin="">I looked at her with curiosity.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWFjMTdjYjdkZTRlMDA5NTliOTc2MDI3MWJkNmJk" data-original-margin="">"Are there dungeons nearby?"</p>
<p class="cnNjMGFiNTZiZWJkYjRkM2Q4OGYwMTJiMzBkNDcxOTQz" data-original-margin="">Rei kept a smug grin on her face.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGM4MDg0YjQyMjQ2ODM4ZWRmOGI4ZWI0ZGEyZmJl" data-original-margin="">"There are, but that's not exactly where we're going. Trust me, you'll like this place."</p>
<p class="cnNhM2M5OWJiOWJiZTRhZjI4NmZmNGQxNjI3OTRmMTQ1" data-original-margin="">She hopped on an escalator moving downwards and we followed.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDMxZWRlZDllZTQ1MmZiYTFjNTlkMGQxZTA2MDBh" data-original-margin="">I wonder where we're going to test out our new weapons in the capital?</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjRhOGNkMGQ2ZjQzMzE5ZTZkODE4YjhkMGJiM2Jm" data-original-margin="">Wherever it is, Im looking forward to it. I'll get to see Maria in action for the first time too. This day is about to get even more exciting!</p>
