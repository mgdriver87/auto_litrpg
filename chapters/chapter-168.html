                <p class="cnNkZDA1NDQzOTRiODQ0NDY5OTZlZjAzMTZiNWEyZmVk" data-original-margin="">I look up at Fisher while powering down my sword.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzVlMDY3NmQ4NzQ2ZDc4OWMwNjlmNzI0NTg4Y2E1" data-original-margin="">I've had a lot of time to think about my situation here in the labyrinth while I was away training in the Titan's Domain.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjNmZWM3NjVlNjQwZDBiZmRkYWYwNjIxOTNmMDYw" data-original-margin="">When we first met, I was a bit annoyed with this blue-haired Elite for stepping on my toes during my solo labyrinth diving mission.</p>
<p class="cnM5NWMzODA0MjdiOTRkNGI4MWRlYjFkMmZhZDgxNzQ0" data-original-margin="">I still am... but he's just following orders. If anything it's the Director's fault. He's telling all the other Association lackeys around here what to do. I don't blame him for following through on his mission, but I still work better alone...</p>
<p class="cnMzZGNkNWYwZmE5MzQxZTNiNWE4ZTZhNDY4MDczNmFh" data-original-margin="">Fisher continues to speak.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTgxMmEyZGQ3MDQ1MmU4YjQxZWRhNWE4YTE2MTVi" data-original-margin="">"We'll be climbing the Labyrinth."</p>
<p class="cnMzMTFlNzIwZjBmZDQ1ZWM4YTRmNjQzZGJjNWZmMDE5" data-original-margin="">I hear what he has to say, but I was expecting it... I reply.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGZkNjg2MTI3ZDQxZjA5OTNmYjc0OGU0YzMyOTQ1" data-original-margin="">"I still want to climb these floors alone you know... Just because the Director wants us to team up, doesn't mean it has to happen."</p>
<p class="cnM2MDg0OTI4Zjk3YjQ4NmY4ZDhiMjdjZWFlMjM2YzMy" data-original-margin="">Fisher smirks, letting out a light laugh.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDc2N2NiNDMzMjRmN2NiYTUwMmQzODJlM2VhMTRj" data-original-margin="">"I remember when I still had the will to fight like you. Trust me, stay on his good side while you still can."</p>
<p class="cnNlY2MyMzYyY2YzYjQzZTZhY2Q1MjdmNWJmZTYzYjkw" data-original-margin="">I lock eyes with Fisher. He looks back at me with a serious, worry-filled gaze.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2NiNWM5MzkyNTQ2OTliZjBkYjY1YzkzMjg3ZGRk" data-original-margin="">I turn away first, replying under my breath.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTk5YmM4MjdlNjRjNTliNjFjNGFhMzk3ZTM2OThm" data-original-margin="">"This is no fun..."</p>
<p class="cnNiZTYwNTk0NGIwZTQ5MWQ5YWQ4MGY0YzhhY2VlNTQw" data-original-margin="">The Elite sighs, then replies.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjQwYTMxMTRiMjQzYmNhY2EwZTVjN2E0ZDczMjI0" data-original-margin="">"It's not meant to be fun. We're going to war soon you know."</p>
<p class="cnM3NzU4MjhjM2Y0NDQyM2RiOTg3NzUxNTdhOTcxNjhh" data-original-margin="">I gulp, looking up at him.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2IwODFjNDgzNjQyNGE5ODkyOWEyMmRkN2Q3ZTNi" data-original-margin="">"What are you talking about...?"</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGQ4OWNhZjlkMjQ0NzA5YzRkZTg0ZjkzMTQxYzBl" data-original-margin="">"The breaks up north, coming from the Dark Continent. They're the worst ones we've had in a long time... That's why we're even here in the first place, and why the Director put so much money into training you C-Class recruits."</p>
<p class="cnMyMjJjNGIzOThiZjRkNTg4YzhmOWE1YjNiM2UwYmE1" data-original-margin="">Fisher digs through his item storage and takes out two palm-sized crystals. They're both completely white and give off a low mana filled hum.</p>
<p class="cnM3MmRmZWQ1NDY0MTQxNjY5MWJmM2FlYTRjOTgzYzli" data-original-margin="">"If necessary, we'll be using these to transport back to the Association HQ. They're one-time use transport crystals."</p>
<p class="cnNiYzU0MjIwMmY5ZjRmNzhiNjAxOWU1ZTBhZDNlZDU2" data-original-margin="">I raise an eyebrow, staring at the glowing items until Fisher puts them away and continues to speak.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWRmZjkxYTVlMjQ1OTU4ZTJkMDc0MmU0MTJmMjVk" data-original-margin="">"I hear you have a mana crystal quota too don't ya? We can help you fill that while we climb the floors."</p>
<p class="cnMwOWMwYTE1NjdhNDQ0NjhiYjM4OTZlOWZkMjEwMDE5" data-original-margin="">With a grin, he points a thumb back to Rylan. The redhead jumps in.</p>
<p class="cnNjMGUyZjVlMTFiZTQ2MzhiNzM0ZTczNWVjZDdkMmE5" data-original-margin="">"Hey! I never signed up for this free labor!"</p>
<p class="cnNhMDE1NDc0ODM4OTQ3MjI4Nzk5ZDFhYTBkZDNmYzBi" data-original-margin="">Fisher turns back to him.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmQ0Mjg3Yjk4YzQ3M2FhMWVjYjEyMGRhYWM3OTUw" data-original-margin="">"I... think you did. You should be with your squad on floor 17 anyway. We'll drop you off on the way up."</p>
<p class="cnMwYzgxOGQzYjM1NzQ4OWM4Mzk1OGE4MjcyM2RkMjIz" data-original-margin="">He opens his mouth to reply, but stops and nods.</p>
<p class="cnMyM2UwM2FkMmIzNzRiOTdiZWQzMzdmYzBhZDA5ZTk2" data-original-margin="">I think about it for a moment, then let out a sigh and a shrug.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODdlZDNmMWMyYTQ1YmZhZmZlNzMyNDcxM2RhZDIy" data-original-margin="">"Fine, I guess I might as well."</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2Q5MmNjZjEwYTRjMmM4MjBhNzI1OGZhYzk0YmVj" data-original-margin="">Fighting this point won't get me anywhere.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjU4NDgzZTA5ZjQ1NmU4MWNkYjJkYzMwNDEyYmVl" data-original-margin="">I could probably farm 50k MP worth of crystals in a few hours if I teleported around any dungeon solo, but abandoning my mission isn't a good idea. Even if tricked into it won't get me anywhere close to the Director's good side.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjA1M2JlZjNlNDQ5MDhiYjIzYTgwNDM2MjVhZTlm" data-original-margin="">Although Fisher seems to be completely tied up by the Association, I still sense some fight in him. I'm curious to learn a few more things about him, and see what else he can potentially teach me about mana control in the meantime.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGMwYzY4NjI5NjQ4MTk5NzM5MDZiMWZiMmMyYmRi" data-original-margin="">Even though he didn't teach me much directly, he's been pointing me in the right direction every step of the way so far.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTQwYWU2ZTQ4OTRkNjU5MDk5MWVkM2FiZmRkZjc3" data-original-margin="">I speak up.</p>
<p class="cnM2NWM5ZDA4YjE2ZjRiMDZhNmMwZjlmMTBiY2FiYWZi" data-original-margin="">"Before I agree... Could I test out an attack against your mana shielding again? I'd like to see how far I've come since our last clash."</p>
<p class="cnNiOWNkYzkzZGMxZDRiNzZhMmZiNjUxM2ZjOGRmZjE2" data-original-margin="">Fisher crosses his arms, giving me an arrogant smirk, while Ryaln's eyes light up behind him.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDNkYjhmMzUyNDQ4NDQ4NDcxYzhjNTcwOWU1NTZi" data-original-margin="">"Sure, go for it. It'll give you a good idea of how hard these higher-floor monsters will really be. Now that you understand mana control a bit better, you'll realize how outmatched you really are."</p>
<p class="cnM2OTA5MTI4MzFiMzRiMDdiMGRjMDg5YzBjZTAyMDFj" data-original-margin="">He takes a step back and puts both of his arms to his sides. Rylan gets out of the way as I step in from of him with a sharp look in my eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWZjOTU3ODFiYjQ2NGZiZjI2MDFhYjBjOWQ2ZDk2" data-original-margin="">"You're sure? You don't even want to block with your sword?"</p>
<p class="cnM5YTkyNjliMTE4MjQ1NGRhY2JmOWMyNDFjOWVjMmRi" data-original-margin="">He rolls his eyes and shakes his head.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTFkMDEyZTk1MTQ5YjdiOTI5YzkxMzFjZmM5NTZm" data-original-margin="">"Don't worry. Go all out. I know your full potential power already, you'd need over double that to even think about breaking through my shielding. Try all you want."</p>
<p class="cnMyN2I1NWExYWQxYjQ0NGQ4NmFkZTI1ZTIyMWQ0M2U2" data-original-margin="">I clench my jaw, then grip my blade tight while focusing on an attack. I make my strike as thin as possible, The same width as the attack that sliced through the Berserker's shielding.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGIzNDA4NmU5ZjQ5NjNhYjg0YTU3MjBmOTM4NmM4" data-original-margin="">My availability of mana here isn't as abundant as the environment I trained in, so I can already tell my proficiency has dropped. In just under 60 seconds, I focus around 1000MP into a deadly black fiery slash.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzdiNTJhZmY2YTRkMmRiMmI2NWViMmQwZDU0YzE1" data-original-margin="">With a swift swing of my blade, I let it soar.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjQwN2Q4NTRlMTQwNmRiYjYwNDYyZWU2Y2Q5ZmVi" data-original-margin="">The swordless swordsman's expression changes as he watches the thin energy blade approach.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTE5ODE0ZTJmYTQyNjg5NGJmYzFmM2YwZjI0MWRk" data-original-margin="">Using my All-Seeing Eye to watch from afar, I witness his mana shield activate less than a meter before impact. It's denser than any shield I've faced before... I didn't get an actual close look at it last time we faced off...</p>
<p class="cnMwYzgyNzVhZmFlYzQyNWZiZjNiZDlmZDhmY2IxMGE3" data-original-margin="">Well, I did. I just didn't understand how fine-tuned his mana control really was.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjU5MGQyNWMyYzRlNTU5YmFhMzNiYmE1MmQxM2I2" data-original-margin="">My sliver of energy meets his invisible wall of mana. For a moment, it seems like time stops... My blade hits the center of his chest and comes to a complete halt, pushing forward with nowhere to go...</p>
<p class="cnM2Zjk1MWE5NzliMTQ3NzQ4NGY4ZTdkYzU5YjhiNWEw" data-original-margin="">Moments later, I see a dim flash of white light as Fisher moves out of the way and the blade flies past him, disappearing into the rock face 20m away.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzNmMWM1YTViMjQ4MTY4ZTk0NzA5MDc2ZmM1YTE5" data-original-margin="">A toothy grin creeps across my face at the sight before my eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTdjMzc0M2YyOTQwMWViZjllNTNhNjJmMTljYTk3" data-original-margin="">At the bottom of Fisher's torso on the side my blade flew off to, there's a small rip in his shirt, and a light trickle of blood coming off a tiny paper-thin gash.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWI1ZTViYjY1MjRkOTdiNmJiNmQzMGQ0ODY0N2Ew" data-original-margin="">The blue-haired Elite curses under his breath as I celebrate with a childish attitude. Rylan's eyes open wide as I power down my sword and Fisher speaks while putting a hand over his side. He activates a light blue glow and the bleeding stops immediately.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzBmZjE4ZWRiYzRlMzZhOWZjOTE5MGI3ZmRmOTA0" data-original-margin="">"Damn it- How'd you possibly power up this much in less than 24 hours... That kind of improvement takes months of training! You-"</p>
<p class="cnM2NmIwODY2YmIwOTQxMzFhNjYxMWIwYWQ4MWUxMGRl" data-original-margin="">Rylan steps in.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTQwNTJmOGRkNzQyN2M4NDc5MjllZGEwNDU1ODlm" data-original-margin="">"Looks like someone might be taking your spot as the new youngest Elite hotshot. Wouldn't you say?"</p>
<p class="cnM3NDk4N2EyYzVkODQzODk4ZDQwZTIyZTZmMzVhZjY0" data-original-margin="">He looks over to me, and I just reply with a shrug.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjk4NTJiYmI2YzQzZmI5MzEwNDc5Mzk5NDdjOWM4" data-original-margin="">Fisher speaks up.</p>
<p class="cnMzM2UzZWY1MmI3MTQ3YTU5NmYwOGUxNGUzYWQzZmNi" data-original-margin="">"Well, that certainly settles it. You're at least ready to train on the 19th floor. Maybe even the 20th... Not going to lie, I thought I'd have to beat the Behemoth for you. At this rate, maybe you'll actually have a chance at that thing after all."</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjY0MDY2ZmYzZDRiZDBiZjE5MzZiYzY1YWQxOWQ5" data-original-margin="">"..."</p>
<p class="cnNiY2IyZGZiOWJjNjRkOGNiNDI1NDc1NmUyYmJhNDg3" data-original-margin="">I'm still silent, staring down at my dark blade. Excitement fills my body as I realize just how far I've come.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWQxOWQ2YjY5NjQzOTBhZTc2YzYwYzk0NDdkNTUz" data-original-margin="">It's been a grueling 30 days for me, but it feels like it went by in a flash...</p>
<p class="cnNjOTFiNjU4YzU5YzQ2NTViZGZkNDQ5ODMxMjAyZTQ3" data-original-margin="">"Come on, we might as well start now while the day is young. I brought food and water, let's start our trek upwards."</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGNkZGExNjU0YzQxNDM5ZjU0MDg2OTk0MmFjMjRj" data-original-margin="">I look up Fisher.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzE2Mjk5ZDBjYTQ3ZjI4NDNlZDAwM2E1MzUwNmVh" data-original-margin="">"Already?"</p>
<p class="cnNjZmJiYTExMzJmOTRjNmJiNWYxOTE2YTQyMDE2ZGRj" data-original-margin="">"Do... you have anything else to do?"</p>
<p class="cnMwYWYxYzgyMzdjZjQzMDM5MDI1YzY4NWIzNzU5NWIx" data-original-margin="">"I...."</p>
<p class="cnMxZTU4YTBkNmQ1YzRhZGE4MjExNDM4MGU0ZmU2MzY0" data-original-margin="">"Thought so, come on. We'll farm mana crystals with you up until the 17th floor. That's where we'll drop off this tag-along with his team."</p>
<p class="cnNkNTg0MGFhNmVhNDQxZjA5YjgyZDUxMGM3N2FiZWFh" data-original-margin="">The redhead rolls his eyes, and I nod.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjQ0YzhkOWFiOTQ3NTY4YWFjOTllNWRlMmRkMGYz" data-original-margin="">"Once we make it up there, I'll have to check in with the Association one more time before going up to the dead zone."</p>
<p class="cnNkOTQ4NzVlNjljNDQyNDVhZmU1MWE5MzE5Y2IzOTdi" data-original-margin="">I raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzY2YzIzMTFjMzRlNWNiYjY0ZDU5OTA2N2Y3ZTUy" data-original-margin="">"The dead zone?"</p>
<p class="cnNmNzRkN2RhY2RhNzRjYmZiNmYxMTRiMDgwMjBkZmQz" data-original-margin="">Fisher nods, taking out his silver quota tablet.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjU1ODNhYjc1YzQ5MDBiMzI5MzdiNjJkM2ZkMjQ4" data-original-margin="">His looks much different than mine. It has 4 clear gems attached to each corner.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzJkZDY2NmJjNzQxZWY4MzBlZjM4OWE1MTc4NDdk" data-original-margin="">"The Association can't contact me that far up. Monster's with higher mana control tend to live in much more mana-rich environments. It screws with long-range connections. That's why we call it the dead zone."</p>
<p class="cnMwMjcwMmE3Yjc3YzRlNTBhZTk3NDIzN2ZmNzk0OTFj" data-original-margin="">I nod slowly, not understanding a word he just said. The only thing on my mind is the fact that his tablet has clear gems on it and mine doesn't.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTc3YzlmN2M0YzRkMmU4ZmIzZDc4OGRiMjUyMDE0" data-original-margin="">"Hey, why doesn't my tablet have those- The Director didn't-"</p>
<p class="cnNlNmQxYjllZTY4MzQ4ZWViN2E2ZWQ5YmY5ZTNkNzQy" data-original-margin="">All four clear stones on the tablet begin to light up with a white glow. I stare mesmerized.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTBjNDc0NTVjMjQ4YTQ5YzliYjgwZjk4YTg5MmJk" data-original-margin="">The blue-haired Elite's eyes instantly go back to the tired look I saw moments ago when he was waking up from his sleep at the Inn.</p>
<p class="cnNmODRmMDYwMWNmOTQ5ZDU5OTg5MmIxM2E5MGVjNjll" data-original-margin="">He grips the tablet tightly.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzM0NjJhNThmZDQzZDZiOTA2NzI1Yzc2OTVlYTM5" data-original-margin="">"What kind of timing is this... you speak of the Director's name and he comes calling..."</p>
<p class="cnNlMjBjMTk3OTRkNzRlZmNiNTU3ZjhlYzllMjdlNzRi" data-original-margin="">I gulp.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDE2ZTRmNDRiNTRlODhiZGVhMTRiNjBlZTVkYWNm" data-original-margin="">"He's... calling? Through that?"</p>
<p class="cnNjMWE5OTRhZjQ5NDQzYzQ5YzI1Y2E5NTY3ZDdkMTMz" data-original-margin="">The lights on all four corners of the silver tablet begin to shine brighter and brighter until a very familiar voice comes ringing out into my ears.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTYzNjkyMTkxMDQ0MmM4MjA0MzMyOTY0MjY1MDFl" data-original-margin="">"Fisher. Fisher. Do you read me? We're going to need your immediate dispatch on a series of C-Class Dungeon breaks along the northern border. Please report your training progress with your assigned member of the new Elite squad."</p>
<p class="cnNlZjNkMjYyOGZiNzRhMjJhMDg5OTk2YzIwN2ZkM2Rm" data-original-margin="">Fisher replies.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDU0M2QzZTk5NDQ3MDJhNDA1MzZlYzk3ZTBjN2E2" data-original-margin="">"We're just about to start phase 2 of Jay's training."</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTE0NTU3MGIxZjQzN2FiOTIwZGZiOTJlZWQ4ZWVj" data-original-margin="">"... Phase 2 already? ..."</p>
<p class="cnNjNTAyNTA0YWNiNTQ2YzNiYjBhYTE0ZTcyYWJjMmEz" data-original-margin="">"Yes, Sir."</p>
<p class="cnNlY2NiNmZmNDM5MjQzNTdhMzk3ODQ0ZGI2ODAxMDJl" data-original-margin="">"..."</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDFjNTUyYTk1ZTRmNGM4NTc1YTRkMzMwOWE0ODJm" data-original-margin="">There's a pause on the other side of the line for almost 10 full seconds.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWUzOTE3ZDY3MjQ2ZDFhNGYyOTM2MzkyMmQxNmRl" data-original-margin="">I grit my teeth while listening, but can't hold myself back any longer. I storm over to Fisher with my eyes locked on the glowing quota tablet.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTY2NGZmYmU5YjQyMzE5M2U5OGJlZjNhZTNkNzM5" data-original-margin="">I've been thinking about this man for over a month straight.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDhmMGFhOWVkMDQ4MTZhOWQxYjRlZWU2ODlhZjg3" data-original-margin="">"Let me talk to him, I'd like to give The Director a piece of my mind. I signed up for a solo labyrinth mission, and I'm going to get what I was promised!"</p>
<p class="cnM2YjIxZTgyZTdjNDQ2MmQ4OTg5YzMyMDM4MjgyZGJi" data-original-margin="">I reach over and grab the silver rectangle right out of Fisher's hand.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjAyMjEwMjI2NDQ5NjFiNmI2NjIyNTYzZTMwMGM0" data-original-margin="">"Hey! Hello? Can you hear me?"</p>
<p class="cnM4YTgyOGZkNjIyYzQwYzliYzk3NmE4OWUyOTM4NDQ3" data-original-margin="">Another long pause follows, then the Regional Director's voice finally rings out of it.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDBkZTVmMGFiMzRlZWNiNjc0ZjUxYTE4NDlmYmVh" data-original-margin="">"Well, what a surprise. It's nice to talk to you again so soon Jay. It seems there's been another change of plans."</p>
