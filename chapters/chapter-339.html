                <p class="cnNmMGQ5NTY5NWUxNzQ4ZTRiOTZhNjdhYmE3ZmVjZTA3" data-original-margin="">I walk out from the dungeon hub square, and the early morning sun shines down on Solara.</p>
<p class="cnNhNmQwZWQ0Yjc3ZjRkNGRhNDk5N2M3NmJjMjM0MWNh" data-original-margin="">The guard outside gives me a nod, followed by a weird look as he doesn't recognize me. It's not unusual for hunters to stay overnight in dungeons. It's easy to assume I entered when he wasn't on his shift. He shrugs and continues on with his day.</p>
<p class="cnMxYmQyNjNkNzNhMDRiYWNiZDgyMGMyNjY3NWJiNjY3" data-original-margin="">With this, I look out at the city with a brand new disguise but still keep my red hood covering my face.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzljYWUzNWQ3YzQ4ODk5YjFkN2VlZjY5MGEzY2Uw" data-original-margin="">My muscles are pretty sore, but I manage to still walk down the streets at a moderate pace without signs of any limp or slowness. If I were to jump back into battle right now, it would be a bit more painful, but I'd be able to fight at 90% power without much problem.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDllOTNjMjhhMzRlMjY4MDZmN2ZjNjQ0NzZkMTNl" data-original-margin="">Although I may feel a bit better, it doesn't mean I'm not exhausted for the time being. I drink some water and left over food in my item storage on the way. It perks me up a bit.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWUxZTczMGZkMTQ3NjNiODIzYjU2MjZmYTViMTll" data-original-margin="">Minutes later, I walk through the front doors of the bar and see the same middle-aged bartender talking to a few lower-level hunters at the side table he mentioned to me a few days back.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjg2ZTg0MGNmZTQ5OTNhYTk3M2I1OGNlN2E5Mzg1" data-original-margin="">The bar, once crowded with almost a hundred hunters and tables full of multicolored cocktails and drinks with flashing lights and full of laughs, is now completely empty.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWQyZjFlNzNlOTQyMTliOTBkNWE4YWQ1MTA2MTRj" data-original-margin="">As I walk closer, the man and woman turn away from the bartender at the side tables with a few handfuls of silver each and smiles across their faces as they pass me. A voice sounds out in the calmness of the morning.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWEzYTYxODQxYzRlZTRiMmQ3NDhmN2NmYmQ4ODA3" data-original-margin="">"I recognize that quality of red cloak you've got there, son. You're the hunter that wanted to make his way to Valor City a few days back. I knew you were just messing with me when you said you'd show back up the next day with all the quests completed."</p>
<p class="cnNjNzAwMzUzYTA2YzRiYzI5ZjBhYzNiYzM0NmM1Nzdi" data-original-margin="">He lets out a chuckle, and I play along while reaching under my cloak to grab the quest papers.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzRiYmUzMjE2NjQ3ZTU4ZjJiMjcwOWFiYzA1OTk4" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, something came up. However, I do have them all completed for you now. Three days wasted is still better than taking the train."</p>
<p class="cnMyYzczODUwZmU1OTQyZmNhZGM3MGQ5MDNjY2M5YjI5" data-original-margin="">I smirk and place the pile of papers onto the counter.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDJkZjBkMmFkYjQxYjE4YmU2NTY3NDViYzlmOGU3" data-original-margin="">His eyes widen with surprise, then tighten with suspicion. The battle-seasoned bartender sifts through each of the papers one by one, reading them and doing math in his head.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjM5ZjAxNTQ0MTQ4YzViNTdhYmJmZTVlMDFiMzUz" data-original-margin="">"Yeah right... These are quests for thousands of the highest-tier beasts in the city. It would take a team of our best fighters months to finish all these. There's no way-"</p>
<p class="cnNkZTczMGJhYWE0MzRiNDU4OTM4Y2NkYzBkNTRmYzVl" data-original-margin="">*THUD*</p>
<p class="cnM4NmZjYzNmNzk2OTQwMTA5ZDJjMWVmMGRhYWI5NjU3" data-original-margin="">I begin pulling out the Minotaur horns first, stacking the black and red shimmering high-grade items in a pile on the bar's wooden floor.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjIxMTU0ZDhjMDRlYTM5NzZhZmYwNjY3ZDZmM2Qw" data-original-margin="">It begins to creak under the pressure, and my thin smile grows the longer he's left speechless.</p>
<p class="cnMxZTVmNzQ1MTgyMzQ5ZjE5ZWRhMTNmMGVlZmQxZjll" data-original-margin="">The man keeps his mouth open in shock, but doesn't say a word until I turn and start pulling out piles of rat claws and turtle shells next.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjYzNDJjODhhNjQ0MTdhMGU4YmZkODY4ZTM4ZDcz" data-original-margin="">I can hear wood splintering under the weight, and he puts his hands up.</p><p class="cjM3MDY1YTg3ZDZmMDRlZWQ4ZTkwNzM2MWVjZGVhNGMw" data-original-margin="">A case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjhmNzY5NDNhNDQzNDhiZGI0YWQzZmVlNWIyMzZj" data-original-margin="">"H-Hold on a moment, let me get some item boxes from the back. We can store and count these for you in a moment."</p>
<p class="cnM4YjYyMTg1MTQyNzQyNGU5ZmQzOWU3NGM5Nzg3NWE1" data-original-margin="">The bartender runs into a backroom and comes out a few minutes later with a handful of small item boxes along with a kid no more than 16 years old wearing an apron. The dishwasher came out to help with the extra work.</p>
<p class="cnNhODQ0MzQxZWJjNTRjY2JhNjA2MTVhYjdmNGNlNTBl" data-original-margin="">We begin going through every quest from top to bottom. The highest paying ones like the Minotaur horns and bulk mana crystals pay out a few dozen gold each, while the middle-ranged quests pay tens of silver to a few gold coins, and lastly, some smaller ones are just a few silver.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGI5ZmEzOWFkMzQyYWQ4ZmVlODIwNmE3ZTA5NGE3" data-original-margin="">Both the bartender and the dishwasher can't believe their eyes as I continue pulling more and more items from my cloak to match with every single quest paper.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzAxYmM3N2MxZTQ0N2ViOGEzZTc2NWUxMmNjZGIy" data-original-margin="">It takes over 2 hours to sort and count everything, but finally, I'm given a total for everything by the man.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjg0ODUzOGM3ZDQ3YmRiMGFlOTM1YzFhMDlhNjY0" data-original-margin="">"That's the final one right there, your total after the 2% Solara Government tax on large payouts is 138 gold and 42 silver."</p>
<p class="cnMxYmRjOTI4MmY5NjQzYmJhZTJkOWYyZmI1NzNhN2Y2" data-original-margin="">I nod, and the corner of my lips curls up as he starts stacking gold out from a silver safe with the Solaran Government logo on it.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTU3OWUzNzdkYzQzZDI4NDMwZWJlMDIzZTg4NTJk" data-original-margin="">This brings my total gold to just about 150, counting the leftover I had stored away from previous quests and missions back in the Vice Region. It's over half way up to where I was before spending it all on those soulstones. This time around, there's no emergency so I'll be sure to save and spend it wisely after purchasing the transport crystal.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTM3MGM2NjVjMzQxZjI5MmZjMDI2ZmIyN2VlYzRh" data-original-margin="">Also, the fact that I'm capable of clearing out the quests in any city I go to and make a hundred gold a day if I please fills me with confidence. Maybe I'll do the same at the Capital in Sector 1.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTc0ZWRiZjMxYzRmODg4YTljYmNkOWE3MjNmNjJl" data-original-margin="">"Great. Which way is the Solaran Government office?"</p>
<p class="cnM0NTQyZTM1YTVhMzQ0ZmQ5MTk1ZWExNDE5MWFjNTcw" data-original-margin="">I grab stacks of the coins and put them under my cloak and into my storage as the man responds, giving me directions.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzQ3YzgwOGM3YjQ5OGU4NzJlOTAyZjczMDQ4Nzg5" data-original-margin="">With that, I turn around and raise a hand in the air to wave.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjRiZGY1MDE3MjQyMjg5ZGU1YTAwM2VmODQwYjgy" data-original-margin="">"Appreciate it. Maybe I'll come back soon for some more quests."</p>
<p class="cnNlMzg5Nzc3ZmQxYTQyYTliODRlZTg4ZTAwZDU2MjM4" data-original-margin="">Then, I walk out the door.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmQ1NGMxYTNkMTQxYjBiZGQzMzdmMzA5ZjBhNWRj" data-original-margin="">Both the bartender and the dishwasher lean back against the wall with looks of awe, but also nervousness on their faces.</p>
<p class="cnMyNWQyZjMzMTNhYTQ4ZGQ5YThkMWNmOWEyNjZmNWQ5" data-original-margin="">I hear the kid speak under his breath as I turn the corner.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGU5OTk0MWQ5MzRjNDE4OTE0ZDUwODU1ZjA5YjNm" data-original-margin="">"Hey boss, that was all the high-grade quests the capital had to offer this month. The hunters aren't going to be happy about this. Who is that guy?"</p>
<p class="cnM3MGZlZDRjZjE3ZjQ2NTY5YzcxZjNjMWRiMjQ4NWY4" data-original-margin="">He replies, but I only hear his last remark.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDczYWMxZjhiYTQ5OWE4MWUyYzhiYjQ0YTg4ZGIx" data-original-margin="">"Doesn't matter. Whoever hands in the quests, we'll get the same commission. It's better not to question the actions of a man who can pull something like this off in just 3 days."</p>
<p class="cnM3MzY2NDRiMmZkZTRmZmVhMjBiYTIwMzgyYzkyOGFi" data-original-margin="">I smirk and chuckle to myself. If only they knew I finished everything in a matter of hours.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzNjY2Q3NTRjZTQ3YmRiNjkyMTQyZTgwNmU1ZDA2" data-original-margin="">If there's any backlash from me clearing all these quests, I'll be out of here before they even catch wind of it. Considering all the trouble this city has brought me, I hope I leave them with a little chaos.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTdjOWYxYjA1OTQ0M2M4OWI1N2ZjNjdlMzI4MzYy" data-original-margin="">With a single coin being twirled around my fingers, I finally make it to the government office and walk up the long rows of marble steps before walking through the front blue glass doors that slide open.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzE2NGIzNjU4YzQwNzZiMWYxMGFhOTA5ODU3MzE1" data-original-margin="">Chatter fills my senses as I'm met with the blinding whiteness of mana shielding on the floor and walls.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTVlYjJmZjljMDQ1YTA5ZjlmOWI0YTE5NWQxYmYx" data-original-margin="">Cityfolk stand in lines behind 4 separate workers sat behind a curved white marble counter at the back of the room to look like a semicircle. Each worker has a small booth with the same clear blue glass as the door, covering their upper bodies above the counter.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDFkZTg3NjJlZDQxNDJiN2M0YTZmOWU5MzZmYjQz" data-original-margin="">Upon closer inspection, it's filled with mana too, similar to the walls, ceiling, and floor. Everything is protected by shielding in this office.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTdhZmVjNThmYzRhMWFiY2YzZTdlNWFkZjg1MWI0" data-original-margin="">*Ding*</p>
<p class="cnMyMGQ2YmY4MWI2YjQxYzViNmFmYzYyNDNhZTEzMmNi" data-original-margin="">A green light pops up above one of the booths and a line moves forward. Once someone steps up to be helped, it changes to red just like the other three.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGYzMTZlZTJlMDQ1MWRhM2FmMDBhNDI5N2Q1NjFm" data-original-margin="">I cross my arms and wait my turn.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTk1ZDRkZWRhNDRiZDY4ZjBjZjQyZmE4ZjBmMzcz" data-original-margin="">"How can I help you today, Sir?"</p>
<p class="cnM4YjRlMTUzZjE1ZDQwMzNiOWExYTJjZjMyZTMxMmFj" data-original-margin="">After less than 10 minutes of waiting, a young woman greets me at her booth with a smile. I reply.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDYwYTFhYjFjNjRjYTJiY2M0NjQ3NmQ1MGIyZGFm" data-original-margin="">"I'd like to purchase a transport crystal to Sector 1. Valor City, to be exact."</p>
<p class="cnNiYWIyNTE5MjU3OTRmYTg4OTg1MjEzMmUyYWU5MDZh" data-original-margin="">Her eyes widen, then her mouth opens but no words come out. She swallows, raises a finger, then looks down at a small silver tablet before tapping it a few times and looking up at me again.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzNiYjE5OWY3YzQ1ZWFiNDE0N2M1N2Y3ZTE0OGFm" data-original-margin="">"Of course. It's not every day someone comes here to buy one, but we still have a few left in stock. Usually, people just take the train."</p>
<p class="cnM3OGVhMjUyNDU2NjRiZTNiZGI1YjcwNTA3ZTgzYmEy" data-original-margin="">She looks down at her silver tablet and taps it a few more times before turning it to me to show bold black numbers.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzdmMDMzMzA3OTQ2YTZhZWU4NWU2M2E1ZjcwZTg2" data-original-margin="">"The current going price is 24 gold and 11 silver."</p>
<p class="cnNmZjE0ZGViNzk2OTRmNWJhYjRiMzQyMDlmODc1ZDc0" data-original-margin="">I reach into my storage and place the requested amount on the white marble table without hesitating for a moment.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWNlZTIwYzYyNTRjODM4ZGZjM2U0NDI5MDU2NzBm" data-original-margin="">"That's perfect. I'll take one."</p>
