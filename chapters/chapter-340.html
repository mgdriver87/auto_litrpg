                <p class="cnMxMWQ5NDEyNGIzMjQxNTNhYzgyMTI1NDdkMWRmNjJk" data-original-margin="">The woman behind the counter takes my coins, then walks into a backroom before finally coming back with a small white concealment case. She opens it up for a moment just to show the white crystal inside, before closing it quickly and pressing a small button on her workstation beneath the counter.</p>
<p class="cnMxZTBkNzMyZTdkMzQyNzY4YzZmZjMyMjY2OTA4YmJi" data-original-margin="">A portion of the blue glass window slides open, and she pushes the rectangular case through. As I grab it, she speaks to me.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWRkNzM0MDQ4YTQxZDg5OGY3YzBlZTU5OGM1N2Uw" data-original-margin="">"I'm sure you know how these work. You don't need an explanation, do you?"</p>
<p class="cnM4NDA1MzNiMzRkZTQyYmQ5YmFhM2YxNTMwNzAwMmJm" data-original-margin="">I nod while accepting the box, remembering back to the crystal I used after defeating the behemoth in the Vice City labyrinth a while back. It transported me beneath the Association building right before we headed off as a team to the dark continent.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzFhYTAxZWZjYjQ4Yzk4ODFlNjhhZTU1NDNjNDY5" data-original-margin="">"Of course. It's a one-time use transport spell. I just break the crystal and I'll be teleported to Valor City, right?"</p>
<p class="cnM1OWNlOGM2NWYwNzQ4YTE4MWM1ZmJjZTA0OGYxMWJi" data-original-margin="">She smiles and nods with a sparkle in her eye.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjlmMGZlZWY3YTRhMTM5NDc2NjIyMmM4M2RkNzJl" data-original-margin="">"Yes, exactly that. You'll be sent to a teleport platform right outside. Valor City is the City of Commerce, so keep an eye on your coins at all times. Those without them very seldom leave. Though, I don't think I have to tell someone like you that twice."</p>
<p class="cnM0YmZkZTZiNGU4MDRmYzdhZWVjZjcwMzU5NWFhYmI2" data-original-margin="">She gives me a thin smile, and I give one back with a quick nod. However, the atmosphere slightly shifts, and a hint of sorrow shows in her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNmMGFjNDQ0ODU4MTRlMDQ5OGEyOGI4NDJhMjMxZGY5" data-original-margin="">Then, she gives another bright smile just like when I entered making me question if I imagined her brief change of tone.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDg2YmI2YTQwMTQ0MjI5NjhlYTY4NjIyMGU3OTAy" data-original-margin="">"Anyway, is there anything else we can help you with today, Sir?"</p>
<p class="cnMyYjlmZjdhYzVlZTQxMGI5OTA3ZTFmMTRmZjFkNDI1" data-original-margin="">I open my mouth to ask what she meant by that but decide to brush it off. Keeping track of your money is good advice for anyone.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjQ2OWM3MTY0NjQzN2U4ZjA0YTljMDBhMTM0Yzg1" data-original-margin="">"This is all I need, thanks. Have a good rest of your day."</p>
<p class="cnNhNGJiNmE3N2RkYTRhOWI5MWU4NjM0MGI5ZDY1ZjEz" data-original-margin="">I turn and walk out the door I came, then begin making my way down the marble steps.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjNkYzE4YmY4MzQyZTJhZjliMWE3OGViOWE0YTI5" data-original-margin="">The morning sun is about to come directly overhead to mark the middle of the day as I step into a less crowded street and take out the white concealment case.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzI1ODg5ZTgzNzQyMjhiNGZmNGY5YmNjODVjNmRm" data-original-margin="">"Well, there's no reason not to go right now. I've waited long enough."</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjEwN2IzMGU0OTQzZmViYTgxNjBlY2MxNDQzY2Jl" data-original-margin="">After taking a deep breath in and out, the concealment container pops open with a light click and I waste no time in taking out the crystals and crushing them in my fist. A white light takes over my body and I feel weightless for a fraction of a second before my boots squeak against a glossy tile floor.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjExZjhkZGNmZDRjZTU5ZmQ1NjEzY2M1YTVhOTlm" data-original-margin="">The desolate desert city street around me fades, and the chatter of what sounds like a crowded train station fills my ears.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDMzNTU4NThhYTRjNWI4YmY4NTRhNDhmOTZjNGFj" data-original-margin="">Once my vision comes back to me, that's exactly what I see...</p>
<p class="cnM3NjEzNTM2MDZlNDQ1N2NiNmQ1ZWIzMjg1YmJjYjEx" data-original-margin="">Looking down, I'm standing on a large circular tiled surface about 10 meters in diameter, with a large white sign above me on the wall just behind my head labeled [Teleport Platform]. In front of me, a subway system is moving like any normal city would.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDk3ZGE3ZmNjZjQ2YjY4ZGM5OTQ4NmE4Y2JhMjhj" data-original-margin="">Everyone is dressed in much darker clothing here; the red cloak I wear sticks out like a sore thumb. My darker complexion also doesn't match the majority of much lighter skin tones of the locals here.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGY2ZGY5MWU5MDRlNDg5YTYyNTUxMWZhZDI5NDNl" data-original-margin="">My gaze travels over everyone and I quickly change my appearance to match the average person in the crowd before taking my hood down.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmM2Y2FiYWY3YTQ5MTM4ODNhNjc2NjdiMzI1Mjgw" data-original-margin="">I slowly step off the raised platform and walk through the crowd. As I do, a small transport train pulls up, similar to ones used in the Vice Region. Its brakes screech to a halt and a flash of white light appears behind me as another man appears on the transport platform right where I left.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGMxNWNhOTM2NjRiOWE5N2RkOTJmN2FiODJlZjUz" data-original-margin="">A long moving staircase is visible off to my right about 30 meters away, and that seems to be where everyone getting off this train is moving to. I follow the crowd and ride it upward.</p><p class="cmFmNjUyMTYyNmQyNjQ3ODM5N2NmMjIyM2QwZWY4NDhm" data-original-margin="">Unauthorized usage: this tale is on Amazon without the author's consent. Report any sightings.</p>
<p class="cnMxZGU5MTRlNzBiOTQxZTU5ZTlhOWE1ZGYyZGMzNGQ4" data-original-margin="">The blue sky of the outside world comes into view as I step off the top of the escalator and breathe in the crisp and cold air while taking in my surroundings.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTgyNmEyNWU5MzQ3NzY4ZmVlMjhiNDcxODAwOWRi" data-original-margin="">There are small shops that line the streets, selling all kinds of items. Not just hunting gear, but home appliances, food, and even children's toys and personal gadgets.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTNjYWQ2NTkxMDQyNTA5YTA5ZDE3ZjkyN2E0OGYy" data-original-margin="">Everyone that gets off the train below begins heading off in all directions, but again, most head primarily one way.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWYzMjk4OTE2MjRlN2NhMDIxY2U5MWNmZWMwYmZm" data-original-margin="">I scan the streets one more time before deciding to follow the crowd.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjhkZDQ2YWE0MzQ3ZTFhMTgxZmQwOTZiMmM4ODhi" data-original-margin="">The sidewalks are hard, and the smell of food from nearby shops fills the air. People of all background line the streets. Some are beggars, others are busy salarymen, and a couple stand outside shops yelling out deals while holding up signs to try and get people to come inside. Most of the storefronts rise up 1 or 2 floors at most, and some even have apartments above them. Off in the distance, I see a few complexes rising up to 4 or 5 stories, but nothing is close to the high rises in Solara.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDQwODI4N2MyMzQzZjA5ZGRmMzkxZGUwYjBmOWEx" data-original-margin="">I murmur under my breath.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzRmMzU1YTc4ZjQ0MGM5Nzk5YTFhMGM0YjQ1YmE4" data-original-margin="">"Is this really what they call the City of Commerce?"</p>
<p class="cnMzNDg1ZjZiOTkyMzQ5MjNhZjc1OGM1Y2UwOTVhMzg4" data-original-margin="">It's hardly even as impressive as my hometown back in the Vice Region. It's definitely interesting, but not what I expected to see from the so-called strongest and richest city in the Dark Continent.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDRlOTgyMWZhNTQ5ODRiNzMwZThmYjkwMWE1MTQ3" data-original-margin="">Still, I enjoy my time and stroll the streets, enjoying the sight of a new city. The crowds from the station start to disperse more and more to the point where I'm not quite sure who came off it and who is a native citygoer here.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmM1MzM5YTVhMjQyMTA5NTdlMzQ2YWU1ZmM0NzU1" data-original-margin="">I decide to fit in as well and drop into a hunters' clothing store that looks to be my style. Although I could use my conceal skill to make a disguise myself, I'd rather not constantly think about and use up mana on something I could just buy cheaply at a store. Keeping my face concealed is more than enough of a mental drain.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzQwYjk5ZTIwNjQ5NjM4ZjYxMWExZjMwY2U5ODA4" data-original-margin="">I'm greeted by a kind old man at the back of the shop with a wave as I walk in the door and begin browsing their selection. However, I'm soon disappointed by none of the items surpassing 20-30% buffs even in their most expensive sections of the shop. This seems apparent on my face. The man who greeted me speaks up again.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDhmZGI0MDAxZTQ4YzZhMzczOGRiNDE5ZmY0YTY3" data-original-margin="">"Is there anything in specific you're looking for, Sir? You seem to be from out of town. That cloak is of incredible quality, I can see from here you may need to go into the city to find what you're looking for."</p>
<p class="cnM5MzYwZmJkZWYyMjRkYTU4YjM2ZGY1YWRmMzNhYTli" data-original-margin="">I turn to him and raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjZjMTRmNDI5NDRjMGJiZjIwZjUxYTdhZGMzNDAy" data-original-margin="">"If it's that obvious I'm not from around here, then yes, I'm looking for something to substitute for this gear. But-"</p>
<p class="cnM2NzE1MzRhYzYzMTRjYTQ4MTc5ZjM0ZDkwMTllZTdk" data-original-margin="">He finishes my sentence before I even realize it.</p>
<p class="cnMzODEzNDE5MjY1NzQ4NmI5OWNiZGYwYTliNWJkZTRh" data-original-margin="">"But none of my items stand up to the buffs given by your current ones, it seems."</p>
<p class="cnNlNWU2ZmZlNTI0OTRlN2NhMGU1MmY0YWNiZTc5MDJl" data-original-margin="">He gives me a sly smile.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmZjNmUxNWY4ZDQ3MjNhMTYzOTlhN2JjODhlYzY3" data-original-margin="">"Well, if you're just looking to fit in for the time being, I have something that may suit your fancy."</p>
<p class="cnMyNGI5MjMzYWYzNjQwMDJhZWUwMTQxMzQwODYwZTcx" data-original-margin="">He shuffles under his desk counter, and I walk over out of curiosity. This old man knows exactly the situation I'm in from a single glance, so whatever he has to offer must be worth a look.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTBiNTRmYjdmMDQyNjhhYzI4MTk5ODliMDA1NDQw" data-original-margin="">He places a small silver ring on the counter, and I immediately use my appraisal skill to see what it is.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzdkY2Q4ZDQzMjRiZWRhNDY5NGQ5MjNkYzIwNGJl" data-original-margin="">[Silver Ring of Appearance v16][72/72]</p>
<p class="cnM2NjMyMTQ1NzgyZjQ1MTI5NDI4MDBhYmIwNzllZDg3" data-original-margin="">My eyebrows scrunch, and I don't know what to make of it. The old man speaks again.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDViZTk1ZjY5MjQyN2VhZGY3YWFhYTIzNjUxNzll" data-original-margin="">"You've never seen one before. You really are new to town, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="cnNjYWIyN2FlMjE3ZDQyNzRhYzAyMGJmYmUzYmI1OWYw" data-original-margin="">I nod, but he continues.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDY1MTM0ZGM0YTQxODI4MDRjMmYyYWEwY2M1OTY2" data-original-margin="">"Now before you complain about wasting an item slot on your status, I assure you this doesn't count as an active item. It's already infused with all the mana necessary to do its job."</p>
<p class="cnM5NTYyNTNhZWJkOTQ1OTc4NTk1MWFkODExMWY4ODc0" data-original-margin="">He slips the ring on his finger, and his entire appearance shifts. The old man's outfit changes to a long black classy coat and formal pants and shoes to match. It looks just like what the business men in the crowds outside are wearing. My smile widens and I reply.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTgxMTg2ZTcwOTRjZTdiMDg3MjViZWU5YzJiODIx" data-original-margin="">"A one-time use concealment item."</p>
<p class="cnMxOWNhNzM3Y2Y3NTQwNGY4ZjlhNWZhYTJjODgyNzQ3" data-original-margin="">I think back to the time I wore contact lenses similar to what this ring does, but the fact that it's already infused with mana is another thing that catches my attention.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzEzZjgxMGNiNzRlZjM4NWNkMGE5MWFkN2NkZTZh" data-original-margin="">"And you said it doesn't count as an active item? It's already infused with mana?"</p>
<p class="cnMxMjNmNTIwN2U2YzQyN2ViOWMwODA1NTk0NmY3NGU4" data-original-margin="">He takes off the ring and places it back on the counter.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjA2OTgzZDljOTQ2MDJiNGE0NmIxZTM4NzkyZjYz" data-original-margin="">"That's right. This model lasts 72 hours, and it comes in 20 different versions. This one is version 16."</p>
<p class="cnNkODA5NGIxMzA1MDRhZDk4MjUyYjE3NGIwOGI3MTg3" data-original-margin="">He smiles wide while pulling up a case of identical rings from beneath the counter.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWNmMGI2NzA4NzQ0NmM5YmQzZTBlMWY3MGI3ODQy" data-original-margin="">"Feel free to try as many on as you'd like. Just don't wear them too long, I don't want future customers to have too much time missing. They're just a silver each, by the way."</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGQzMGMxNTMzZDQ2Mjc4ZmUxMDNiNDczODQ0Yzc3" data-original-margin="">I nod while picking up the ring he just took off and sliding it on a finger.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDcwOWU4OGIxZDQ5YjNhYmZiZDA4YTFkOTY5MDRj" data-original-margin="">Nothing changes at all in my eyes, and when I check my status, nothing pops up at all. I move over to the closest mirror, and sure enough, the same black coat and outfit is on me now, fitted perfectly.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzZjZDY0MjVlYjRlYWNiMGE0ZGQ5NDNhYmJmNzhj" data-original-margin="">However, less than a minute goes by before the [72/72] on the ring ticks down to [71/72]. I let out a sigh as I realize this is the customer copy he shows everyone. I roll my eyes, but then smirk as an idea pops into my head.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDc4MzljN2IwODQwNWY5ZDRlMmU3MTYyMjc1MWFm" data-original-margin="">Using my mana manipulation skill, I infuse a few dozen MP into the ring, and the bar turns back up to [72/72]. I let out a chuckle and think to myself. It looks like I don't have to buy more than one after all.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjliYmQwOTcwNTQ1MjBhNDAyNTgxMTk0NmVlMTBh" data-original-margin="">I reach into my storage and put a single silver coin on the counter.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTVkNjJmMGEzMTQxMjBiYTZmY2FlYThhOTZjOWJj" data-original-margin="">"I'll take this one; that's all I think I'll need for my time here in Valor City."</p>
<p class="cnMxMWFlNDQzOTM4NzQ1ZDdiNmIyY2I4ZDQ2ZTY0M2Vk" data-original-margin="">He quickly takes the coin off the counter but looks up to me with a concerned impression.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzE0MzJiMGY3ZTRlY2M4OTE5NjY5NWJjZGQ2N2Jk" data-original-margin="">"You're really going up to the City? What business do you have there?"</p>
<p class="cnM2YjcxZjNjZjdmYjRmOTc5MTFlMzkzMTFhMTE3YTIy" data-original-margin="">I look back at him with an equally confused and concerned look.</p>
<p class="cnM3N2FjODhlYWIyMTRjN2VhZWZiZDQwOWFmN2Y0MDgz" data-original-margin="">"I thought I was already here...?"</p>
