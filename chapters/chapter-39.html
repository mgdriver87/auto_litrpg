                <p class="cnMyNzlmMjgzZDdhNTQzMDA4N2Q1ZjJjZDQxZTk1ODNm" data-original-margin="">The train left the platform and we were off.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDEzMTMzMGVhZTQzMzdhODgwZjE5MTI5MWZmZGIw" data-original-margin="">"Hey uhh. What's your name? I'm Jay by the way."</p>
<p class="cnNmMDFlMThmODk1NDRlNjY5NGJmMmQxNjRhNTM3OGJj" data-original-margin="">The light skinned girl looked at me and smiled.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDExZjQ3MjM4NTRlMTY5MzM1MmRiYjE3MjE5NzFi" data-original-margin="">"Nice to meet ya Jay. I thought you'd never ask. My name is Talia, this is Cori."</p>
<p class="cnNiY2JlMjZjODBhODRjMTNiMDljZDI5NGVjZWU3OTkw" data-original-margin="">She pointed to the man. He nodded at me with a small grin.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDYyZThjMjJjNDRhNjdiY2Q3MDhlN2JmMjdhMTNj" data-original-margin="">I nodded back.</p>
<p class="cnM2M2UzZDBmOWYwYjQ1NmNiNGU1MGFmM2U2NTRmYjll" data-original-margin="">"Well, nice to meet both of you. Do you live in the city?"</p>
<p class="cnMyMDc0ZmQyZjI5ZjRkYjg5YmM3NDFhNTIxZmUxMzcw" data-original-margin="">Talia rolled her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjc5ODRmZDgzYzRmZGQ4OGNhYThkZGI5YjFiZWM0" data-original-margin="">"For the moment, yeah. We've been traveling through a few regions these last few months. The goal is to see the whole country and making good money while we're at it."</p>
<p class="cnM0OGNiYmJmNDYzMzRhNmViMWU3ZTllY2Y5YTRmMGNm" data-original-margin="">Cori looked at the ground. He was an odd guy.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTE2N2FkNDA4OTRhNzVhOWNkN2RhMTRlNTNkYjM0" data-original-margin="">"Ahh okay. So you two have been to many other places... If you don't mind sharing some knowledge with me, what are the guilds like in the big cities?"</p>
<p class="cnNjNWYwYzljMmVkNzQxN2M5NTIzYTM3MTBhNTUwNzIw" data-original-margin="">Talia's eyes perked up.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2M1ZGQ1Y2IzZjQ4MjY4M2JjMzQ1MmY1MmM1NjY3" data-original-margin="">"So you want to join a guild? You're a D Class Hunter. Pretty much any small guild will pick you up and give you a decent contract, there's hundreds of them in the city."</p>
<p class="cnM4YjUxMjI2ZWUyMDRhNDVhOTc4YzRiMzE2NzIxM2Fh" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, I assumed so. What about the bigger guilds? Do you know anything about them?"</p>
<p class="cnM2NGFmMDg4ZWUwMjRjZmI5Y2M3ZjQ0Y2U3MTE2YWVj" data-original-margin="">"Well, there's a couple pretty big guilds in Vice city. The 3 main ones are invite only, you probably wouldn't ever even be able to walk through their doors without being at least a C Class hunter with some kind of crazy skill."</p>
<p class="cnNlNmI0MGUzZjAyMjRjYjg5NTJhZDlhNWUzNWI5MGY4" data-original-margin="">I looked at her with curiosity now. It's not just small talk anymore, this is interesting.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjg2ODMyNDliMzRmZjBiMGI0NjQxMTg0NzYyMWIx" data-original-margin="">"What are their names?"</p>
<p class="cnMwOGVkNmVlOGJkMDRlNTg5MTY3ZmU2ZTQ4NjhmOGJl" data-original-margin="">"Uhhh let me think. There's the Viridian Guild, that's the biggest one in Vice City right now. The Luna Guild and Fury Guild are definitely tied for a close 2nd."</p>
<p class="cnNhNWFiMDQ5NWJjNzQ1ZjNhNmEwNWU3YjUxMTVlMDI1" data-original-margin="">I grinned and nodded. I turned to look at the cement walls flying by out the window.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTcyNmI0YjZkYTQyMmRhNjdhZDdjNjhjZjI0MGQ2" data-original-margin="">"Interesting. I bet they have access to some really neat dungeons"</p>
<p class="cnMxY2VmOTg1N2FiZTRmNDJiMDU2OGFkOGQyZTZiYTM0" data-original-margin="">I could see Talia's reflection in the window like a mirror, she made eye contact with me and continued talking.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2U2NDk0NTg2ZTQ0NWM5MDU5NWU0ZDcwZjFmYjVj" data-original-margin="">"Yeah but we're just a couple of D Class Hunters. Even if they have scouts everywhere in this city there's no way they'd reach out to us."</p>
<p class="cnNjODI5YjA5OTg4YjQwNTZiMWQ2NWI3OGY3OGYzZmI0" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, yeah. I can dream."</p>
<p class="cnNlNTg5OWFmZmM5MTRlMWI4NDdmOTM4ZTk3ZjM5MWNh" data-original-margin="">She grinned.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzliZGVkMzdlNjQyYjc4MTUwMzMwYzhjZGQ5OTE5" data-original-margin="">"Screeeeeech."</p>
<p class="cnM1MDFlOWY2ZmQ5MzQwZWZiY2M0ZWQ5NTBlODViMGIx" data-original-margin="">We made it to the troll dungeon.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzZlZjYwNDFlMjQ1Yzc5NzZkZTMxOGY5N2Y1NWFj" data-original-margin="">The escalator up was exactly the same as the dungeon I visited yesterday. At the top there was a very similar room with a floating blue portal at the back.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmU4ODhjZmUxYjQyNjZhMjIyMDNiMmVjMTZjNmU4" data-original-margin="">Talia and I drew our swords, Cori stretched his arms and got into a readied state as well.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTIyOWFkNzYxZDQ4MWM4OWY0MWJkN2Q3MmFhZWE5" data-original-margin="">We all jumped through.</p>
<p class="cnNiZWUzMTRlYTY1OTQ5YzQ4MmJjOWZlMzNmMDMyNzE4" data-original-margin="">This is definitely a new dungeon environment for me.</p>
<p class="cnM2NGEzMDAyY2IxZjQwODRiNTczMjAxODY2OTg1Yjlm" data-original-margin="">The ground is moist and the air is very humid. There are small swamp patches everywhere I look.</p>
<p class="cnM3OGZhOWZjNjcwOTRiZTdiZTg4ZTM0MTM5ZWM2YTU0" data-original-margin="">The moss smells weird and pond grass rose up to my knees everywhere I stepped. Thankfully there are no bugs in sight, that's a relief. I hate bugs.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmExMjA4ZjAxODQ3MjBhMTFkZTg4NTUyMjY4MGUw" data-original-margin="">When I look out far into the dungeon I can see thousands of trees. Most of them are pretty short and have long green vines hanging off their sagging branches.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTI3YTNhMTRmYjQ4MzA4YjZlMzBkMTIyZWI3NGZj" data-original-margin="">This is honestly a pretty gross dungeon, I should have done a bit of research before I agreed to come. I'm definitely going to have to do a deep wash my boots, or just buy a whole new set of clothes after this raid...</p>
<p class="cnM2YjY0NzUyZDI3MDQ5Y2Q4ZDgyNjA5OWI2MTk1Nzli" data-original-margin="">When I squint my eyes I can make out the shadowy outline of what looks like a large tree in the back of the dungeon.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTI4NDlkODVlYjQ5M2Q5ZWMxNjg1YjgwMjYyMmFl" data-original-margin="">"Hey, have you guys been here before? What are these troll monster like, and is that a tree back there?"</p>
<p class="cnNlODAxYTRiZTA5YTQ1NTZiNWIzYzQ5ZWExMmM1OGE0" data-original-margin="">Talia spoke up.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjMxN2I5NDI3ZjRiZGY5ZmI0YTU3NjE0OGNkMGY5" data-original-margin="">"Yeah we've been here a few times this week with teams of 3 to 5. Trolls drop good mana. They're pretty tricky to kill, but with the 3 of us it shouldn't be a problem. We have two sword users."</p>
<p class="cnNmZGRjMzM5NTk1MDQyYTM4YWFkYThkMWYzMTdlNGZl" data-original-margin="">"What about that tree?"</p>
<p class="cnNkM2RiYWRjNDRkMTQwNzg4YTc2NGE1ZWZhZjU1NjE4" data-original-margin="">"Oh yeah, that's where the boss room is. I've never gone that far in, just heard the stories. Apparently it's a pretty tough boss, powerful magic."</p>
<p class="cnM0YjQ1MzM1YzkyNDRmODBiN2FiNWQ5ZjI2NzcxN2Rh" data-original-margin="">I nodded.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTY4MDg3MTg4ZTQzNzA4ODAyN2ZlYTA1NDkyNDhi" data-original-margin="">"Okay. So we'll just stick around these parts for now and farm trolls. Got it."</p>
<p class="cnM5YjlhZDU1YmQ2ZDRhMzhiZTBkNGVmNzQwYmU4YTlj" data-original-margin="">She nodded.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDY0MzQ3ZWQ0MzQ2MTNhYTNjNjc5M2EyMTIyMDAx" data-original-margin="">Cori spoke up. This was the first time I heard his voice. It was light and quiet.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTU0NWE3NjlkNjQ2OGViMDNhZmVhMDIwOGVlMWQy" data-original-margin="">"One enemy. 100m ahead."</p>
<p class="cnMyYzBlNDBiYThiNzQxOTFiMGE5ZTQ1OTA0ZGNlZDI3" data-original-margin="">He must have some kind of enemy detection skill. I activated mine as well to see what he was sensing.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTVlZDY1MTMwYjQ5NDg5ZjQ0OWZhODcwMDY2Y2Yx" data-original-margin="">A large creature was moving towards us at a consistent speed right in front of us like he said.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjhkYjgxNjk5YzQxZTg5MjY2NDRmMDI5MTljNWE3" data-original-margin="">I readied my sword and started walking cautiously in the direction of the incoming opponent.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjA0YTk1N2ExNTQwMzhiM2EzNjc3MzcxN2I2ZmY3" data-original-margin="">Cori backed up and Talia took the lead in front of him.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzBjZGFhZjIyMTQxODU5YmY2OTczZjI2YzgyODM2" data-original-margin="">"It's just us fighting. Cori is our support type. He'll find enemies, then help with finishing them off. The actual combat will be handled by us. Okay?"</p>
<p class="cnMwYmU4NTBjYTNjNTRiNDlhMTcwZWQ1YjE2YmY0OWUx" data-original-margin="">I nodded while keeping my eyes locked straight ahead. The creature was moving much faster now. It was less than 50m away.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjQwZDExYTdjNTRhZDI5MThjODhkMzUxY2Q2NTMx" data-original-margin="">The soft swampland makes it much harder to move around with ease. I'm going to have to focus on my footing a lot more during this battle.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDlhYWE1OTk0NjQ5NDhhOWRiYmRkOWNhMzk3Mzdj" data-original-margin="">Moments later I heard heavy footsteps splashing around in the muddy water less than 10m away.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGYxNjY4ZmVhMDRlOWRhZmQzNjBhNTgwMWM1OTZi" data-original-margin="">Talia yelled.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmVjZDZmOTkyODRlOTVhNTk2ZDVmNjg1MmJjOTg2" data-original-margin="">"Its here! Immobilize the enemy and don't let your guard down for one second. Even if it looks dead keep your weapon ready for battle."</p>
<p class="cnM2MTE0Njc0ZDUxYzRhMWZhMmJhMTZhNGFhOGJmMTQz" data-original-margin="">"Got it!</p>
<p class="cnMyZWFiOWQ5MWQwMDRmNTU4MzdkOWMxNGQ1YjA4NTk3" data-original-margin="">Talia was in a very serious battle mode right now. These trolls must really be no joke...</p>
<p class="cnMyOTFkZDdjNjE2YzRiYWY4ZjAzNDExNDRiMDY4M2Vl" data-original-margin="">Moments later it finally came into my view.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjcwMDdjZjg3MzRiYmRhOTVjMDgzOTBkYjczY2Nl" data-original-margin="">*GRUNT* *GRUNT* *GRUNT*</p>
<p class="cnMyMTQ1NzQwY2FlZjQ2NzBhZWI5MjhmNzQ0OTk3NjRj" data-original-margin="">A nasty looking green creature came out from behind a wet sagging tree. Its arms were very long, they were almost touching the ground. The smell coming off this beast was similar to rotting flesh.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDUzZjMwMGFmODRlNWRhYjRlYjYyZTU5ZWJmNTRi" data-original-margin="">It had a wide nose and its bottom teeth grew out like small tusks.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODQwNjU2ZjNmOTQxOWRhMjg0MzMyZDJmZjAyYmVk" data-original-margin="">The monster stood around 3m tall, each of its fingers had long claws that looked as sharp as knives. It was a menacing creature, but I've faced much scarier looking opponents before.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjYyMGQ1NzMxMDRmMDU5ZDNkMGVjMWE3MDc4ZDg5" data-original-margin="">I used inspect to see what I was really dealing with here.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzFhMTlkODQ2YjQ1ODc5NjNiNDNkODg0YzAxYjU2" data-original-margin="">[Lv. 148]</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTkzMzE4OTJmMjRiMGI4Y2IxMDk2MTk5YTgzODNi" data-original-margin="">This monster is a few levels higher than me, but I'm sure with Talia's help it won't be too difficult to defeat.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTBkM2QxZmEzYzQxYjVhODY3YjBiOTdlZTZlNWM2" data-original-margin="">"Alright it's game time Jay. Let's do this!"</p>
<p class="cnNmYmJhNDRiZGIzYTQzZjdiNjA1ZTg2NWFmMGJjYjQ3" data-original-margin="">We both stood in front of the disgusting creature as it charged forward.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzRlNjI5Yzk4ODQ2NDVhMGFlMzBmY2MzOTBiYzQ1" data-original-margin="">"CRRRUUAAARR!"</p>
<p class="cnM5MThkZTBjN2YxYzQ5MWVhYzhiZWM3ODJjNzk4MGI0" data-original-margin="">The troll made a shrieking sound as it started to swing its arms and charged towards us.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODRhN2MyM2JmOTQzN2NhN2I1NTY3ZWI4ZDliNjVl" data-original-margin="">It had a very irregular and awkward movement style. This worked in its favor I guess. It was harder to tell which way it'd swing its arms at any given moment.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTFjYWRlNTVhYzRmZmQ4YWMwYmY4MDNkZDJlM2Zm" data-original-margin="">The troll was quick, but I was definitely quicker.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTIyODcyOTcwOTRiMzBiYmYwOTE4ZDkzY2M4YTY1" data-original-margin="">It looked strong... but just by the way it moved I could tell I was much stronger as well.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2NlODM5NjlmNzQ1ZmQ5NWZkNGJjMmE0Y2RhOTIy" data-original-margin="">How could this thing be a higher level than me? This seems way too easy.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzkyNDBhZTZhYTRhMTI5ODQ1MmFkOTcyNDYzNGQ3" data-original-margin="">I out ran the monster and made a quick doge to its right. Its clawed hand flew passed me as I maneuvered myself behind it.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2RjMDE1YWMzYzRiZTA4YjQ5YjE3MTg1NGFkY2U5" data-original-margin="">This creature isn't the smartest tool in the shed either...</p>
<p class="cnNiMjAxODI2MWYyOTQyMmNhMmQ1NTliODUyZTg0MDNh" data-original-margin="">Talia dodged to the left and the beast started eyeing her.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODJhNjc2NGJjMTQ4YTdiODAwZjdkYzQ2YTgzNjBl" data-original-margin="">It made an odd jerking motion and started sprinting towards her and away from me.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGExYTNjNTZiMjRhZmRhMmY0N2M3MzFjODQyZDg5" data-original-margin="">Talia could definitely handle this mindless beast herself, but I wanted to show her that I can pull my own weight.</p>
<p class="cnM2Mzk2ZjA2ZGFlMTQ2NGFiZWJkMjhkMDBkM2MxNmM5" data-original-margin="">First impressions are everything.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTc0ODlkN2JlMzQyOWNhMmJhYTVmMTE1MjU2NzEy" data-original-margin="">I readied my sword and followed the monster as it hobbled away.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTI3ODUyOWU1OTQxMzRiNmMyN2ViZjA2Y2NiOWFm" data-original-margin="">I planted my right leg on a hard bit of ground making sure not to get stuck in the mud and jumped forward straight at the toll's backside.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjQ1ODJhZjE5YTQyYzQ5OWNkMDgwMmIyZmRhYTFj" data-original-margin="">"Shinnnggg"</p>
<p class="cnNhNzBkNjY4MTI1ZTRjOGFhMGZkYjg0MjE5Y2EzMDMw" data-original-margin="">"THUDDDD."</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTFhZmMwZGZlZDRiMjBiZWUxM2UwNmJkZDhiYTAy" data-original-margin="">I landed a picture perfect slash directly to the back of the monster's neck. Its head came clean off and landed in a patch of moss.</p>
<p class="cnM3MWRmYzQ2M2M0NzQ5NDFhNThjOGQ5NjkwMTQ5MzFh" data-original-margin="">I stared down at its disgusting head and its body fell into a shallow swamp behind me.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmFkMDQ0NDQ4ZjQ2MmM4Yjg1YzVhMDEyYzVhNzc0" data-original-margin="">I looked over to Talia with a satisfied smile on my face.</p>
<p class="cnMwODhhYWM0NDRiNjQ0YjdhNWU4NmEzNTBhYmYzZDNi" data-original-margin="">"Well, that was easy. Clean hit right?"</p>
<p class="cnM4MTU1YTM1ZWU3ZDRhNzlhY2E4ZDgzOGQwYzdjMjU2" data-original-margin="">For some reason she didn't look happy for me... I spoke up and tried to lighten the mood.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDcwZTFiZTJkNTRkM2FiYzZiMTEyY2I4MWQxNDky" data-original-margin="">"Come on!! You're upset I took the first kill or something?"</p>
<p class="cnMyODZiOWI1ZDViODQxOWRhN2E3MTc4ZjQxODFmMGYy" data-original-margin="">She still didn't even crack a smile. Talia just stood there holding her sword straight ahead looking off in the distance behind me.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTYzNWYxZDBiMzQ5OTNiZjQ1N2VjMmYwODIxNTUz" data-original-margin="">"Stay alert Jay! I told you. Don't underestimate these things."</p>
<p class="cnNkN2IxMjNkNGNmYzQ4MjY5NWQzZjJlMzRhZGU3MTg5" data-original-margin="">I stared back at her with a confused look.</p>
<p class="cnM0MzZlYjY2Yjc1MzQ3NDJhMDhkMjQ0MGY0YzliY2Ex" data-original-margin="">Then I heard movements of another troll.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDhmMDJlOGFmZjQzMWY5NWRiMTg5YWM1ZWRiMDQx" data-original-margin="">They must travel in pairs... or even groups..? Is this what Talia meant?</p>
<p class="cnNlMDRlZmI3MTFlODQwNGFiYjNmMTM5ODRjYzJjMjM3" data-original-margin="">I turned around and my eyes went wide.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzUwMjU5ZWQ2ZTQxZTViY2E2MjYyN2Q2MWQ2Y2M0" data-original-margin="">This is not what I was expecting at all.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzQ4ZjM0ZjBjMTRhMGVhZjVmZjAyODA5OTc5YmEz" data-original-margin="">The body of a troll was climbing out of the shallow swamp... yes, just the body.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTJkMmE0Y2UzMDQ3NzM4ODllMzNkZTA0M2U0NWIy" data-original-margin="">I gripped my sword tightly and stared at the abomination before my eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjVkOTE2NDc2MjRhNjdhZTUwNTIxYmZjZWM5ZGU4" data-original-margin="">The troll I had just killed... seemingly came back to life and its ready to fight me again!</p>
<p class="cnNhYmMxZTFhNDE3MDRjY2E4YTM5ODI0ZWIxZDZjNGUw" data-original-margin="">&nbsp;</p>
