<p class="cnM3MTRhMDA2YTMyMDRjNzk5YTNkZDA1ODg5Y2QwNWI3" data-original-margin="">As I speak these words, the thought of going back into that white-walled prison makes my stomach lurch. If I could never see one of those emotionless monsters again, I'd do almost anything to make that happen.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjhmYmI2MmJhYjQ2YWQ4ODdlNmM4NWNlNWUyNjcy" data-original-margin="">Almost, anything... One of my faults may be the undying urge for more power. All self-preservation and logical reasoning bends at the possibility of this.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODIzM2E0MDgwZTQ1NGRiM2M4N2MzZDQ0MmMwOGM0" data-original-margin="">Ember has a good point. I'm burning through way too much MP to reasonably keep this up.

<p class="cnMxZGQ5NmM1MWY0OTQ1YTU5ODE4NjJkMThiZjAzNmM3" data-original-margin="">The Dragon slips into my pocket dimension and I Dungeon Walk back to my hometown's starter dungeon without a second thought.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTZiMjhkZWIyNzQ5ODc5NDNlOTI4ZmZlNDFlOTEw" data-original-margin="">A wide grin creeps across my face as I step out of the exit portal into the outside world. I make my way to the village market grinning all the way.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGUzMzY0OTBhMzRlZWI5NDhhMzRhZTVjYTY3M2Q0" data-original-margin="">I'm excited. What started out as a nightmare, is now turning into a gold mine for new power-ups. Falling into the Titan's Domain may not have been a pleasant experience at first, but It turn out it may become even more fruitful than I'd first thought.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTY2MTJmZTRlYTQyOTg4ZjczOWU2ZGQwYWQ0OTA0" data-original-margin="">I make my way to a local grocery store and begin stocking up on everything I'll need for this upcoming training session. I grab a small shopping cart and get to work.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2UyODkzNjFhMDQzNjRhZmVhZjIyYzk0ZDU1NDRm" data-original-margin="">I go overkill on the water... Stacking up 10 cases of 20 1-liter bottles, almost clearing out a whole section of shelving.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2ZmNTZiMGFhODQ2YTRhMzgzZWNjNThjZjMyNzdh" data-original-margin="">With food, I keep it simple. I stock up on 2 months' worth of fresh fruits, vegetables, dried meats, and nuts. My item storage works as a perfect preservation chamber, so none of this will go bad.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODEwZTM5YjQ5ODRmMTc5YWI5NjQzYmQxMmI3Y2Vl" data-original-margin="">I grab a few comics and light novels I've been meaning to catch up on at the register while checking out.

<p class="cnMyNDBlZmUyMDkyODRiM2RiNGRiNWU2MTA0YjkxMmNh" data-original-margin="">It's been almost 30 minutes now since I got to town. Not wanting to waste another minute, I jog back to the starter dungeon ready for what's to come next. I'm shaking with excitement, but also some nerves.</p>

One of them could be a monster, but they're traveling close together, and sticking nearby one of the blind spots...

<p class="cnMyZWFmMGE0YThiNDQ1NmM5MDljZDM3Mzg4MjI1Njcw" data-original-margin="">I whisper under my breath.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTk3NjhiN2I4ZDQwZDNhOTk2NDFiMDdjNTgwMzQ2" data-original-margin="">"Could it be Arie and a B-Class...?"</p>
<p class="cnNlNzRiYTVmOGM0YjQ4MjliYWMyMDdjYTQ0MTg5NmIx" data-original-margin="">I remember back to when my team was sharing our weekly quota assignments, recalling Arie's was to take down a Titan. He did say that he'd be accompanied by a B-Class Archer. There's a good chance that's them.</p>
<p class="cnMzNGNjNjYyY2Y4MjRiMWJhODIxMzg3NjFhMDZmZTY4" data-original-margin="">Not wanting to make an awkward unplanned appearance, I Dungeon Walk in the opposite direction putting another 5km or so between us just in case.</p>
<p class="cnNiZWYwMWM1MjYzNTRmY2FiYmRkZjJkMGZkNTE3ZDdh" data-original-margin="">If I get caught hunting Titans right now, there would be too many people asking many questions I'm not looking to answer. It's best I steer clear of that mess.</p>
<p class="cnM0MzJlMjhmZDZlNDQxODdiODZhNWQ0MzY2MzkzNDcz" data-original-margin="">Once confirming there's nothing but a new slow-moving mass of endless mana within many kilometers of me, I open up my item storage to let Ember fly out.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjM3YjZlMTg2NzQ0OTZiZDBmMTQ4MjRjMjA4NDM2" data-original-margin="">Immediately, I open up our telepathic link.</p>

<p class="cnNkNzdkZGVkODUxYjQxOWI5ZjRlYjA2Nzg2ODM0NTY0" data-original-margin="">I turn to face the low hum as well. Off in the distance, no more than 700m away, a wandering black hole of energy comes marching at us.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWU4NDQwYmIyOTQzYzY5ZTEwODMwODdkY2M3MGM0" data-original-margin="">I take out my sword and instinctually burst into flames. Ember flies low to the ground, and I air-step forward to follow. I hear his voice in my head as we get closer and the humming mana becomes louder.</p>

<p class="cnNkNjRmNmIwNjQzNjQ5ZGJhNTRlOGEwMzNmMGZlMWYy" data-original-margin="">We soar closer and closer as the humming gets more intense. I hold onto Ember's back with my legs and carry my flaming sword with a death grip.</p>

<p class="cnMzZDYxZTcyMmI4YTRiNGI5MTE5ZDlhZDI3ZjVjYmE1" data-original-margin="">Ember bursts into flames as well. We leave a trail of dark fire behind us as he speeds up, facing the Titan head-on.</p>

Although, the more I hunted them the less often those Void Creepers came out from their realm. It would be wise to train inside each one for much longer than 24 hours.

<p class="cnMxMTRhYjMyMjI4MTRlYTRiM2YxMWZkMjdhMmU0Yjkw" data-original-margin="">I nod.</p>
