                <p class="cnM1YTIxZWNlZTU0MTQ4YzBiMmY4NjRhN2IzODEzYTgw" data-original-margin="">My gaze tightens as I conduct a full body scan with my All-Seeing Eye on the tan-skinned archer who walks through the room and sits down in the last remaining empty seat in front of Lith's desk.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTdlOGVhZjk5MzQzNzlhNzA4ZjkyM2M4YjY1YTVk" data-original-margin="">I'm not sure what I was expecting to see, but I'm surprised to find no Demon's Core inside Arie's body. With the amount of used-up Demonic Energy lingering around in his aura, it seems as if he just finished up a battle with a Demonic Creature.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDBhOWNhMjhhYzQ5ZDJhN2VjOWQ4YTg0YWZiYTBh" data-original-margin="">Only one other possibility enters my mind as I open my telepathic link with him.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTYwY2Q3NWE0ZDQzOWNiNThjM2M4Njc3ZTY3Y2Y1" data-original-margin="">"Have you been training in the Abyss?"</p>
<p class="cnMxMGJiM2QwOTIwNDQ1ZjI5ZTJjZDFiMDhhYzU5NjFj" data-original-margin="">His gaze quickly turns to meet mine, and he replies through our link.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTI5YjNjNTZhZTRmM2JhY2RkOThjMTUzZTlkNGVh" data-original-margin="">"I have... but it hasn't been easy. How'd you know?"</p>
<p class="cnNlMzdkZjJjZThjNTRhMTFiMmM4NTQ4YjEwZDAxYTMx" data-original-margin="">I nod and look back to Lith, but reply through our link.</p>
<p class="cnNiY2VmNWY0NDc2NTRkOTRhMTAzZTg3MmQzNzRhYzMz" data-original-margin="">"I can sense the remnants of defeated Demonic Creatures all over you. You can see them?"</p>
<p class="cnNmZjgwYTIwM2NhMTQ4M2Q5MTg4MGEyZTg3YzExMmU3" data-original-margin="">Arie looks back toward Lith too, answering but making it seem as if we're not even talking.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWJjNzk0NzEyNjQ1MzJiODI1MjZhZWM0ZTJkMmJk" data-original-margin="">"I can sense them, yes, and the more I fight them, I can see them more. However, I've found normal mana attacks are very dangerous to use inside the Abyss. I have to use my ranked-up buff as well as the red hydra's power to take them out without harming myself."</p>
<p class="cnMxNmY5YmQxMGM0YzRiMjBhMWYyOGQyMjRhOTM1OGI5" data-original-margin="">I think to myself for a moment as silence in the room continues to settle. I knew Arie's skill was always a bit unique. Spirit Arrows aren't exactly a skill that I've ever seen in anyone else, and with his new ranked-up buff to manipulate this energy allowing him to hunt Demonic Creatures, it must come with some odd special effects too. The last comment about the red hydra's soul energy aiding his fights makes the most sense, however, I still have a lot of questions I'd like to ask.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGY1YjQxNDFhNDRiYTdhNTAxYzVlZTM3ZDU1MzYx" data-original-margin="">"Let's talk after this meeting, I'm sure we have some insight to share about the Abyss."</p>
<p class="cnNiNDllMDQyZjFhMjRmMTI4ZDVmZTcyZGI2NzZhNWJj" data-original-margin="">He gives a small nod.</p>
<p class="cnNkMGE3ZDhiZjFkZTQ5MTdhYWIyZTMwOGNkMjE2NDdi" data-original-margin="">"Of course, you're the only other person that's even acknowledged the monsters in there are real. We definitely have a lot to talk about."</p>
<p class="cnNlNDM5YzE0MDdkNTRlODE5NzQ5NjI1ZDQ0NjFkYjEz" data-original-margin="">As his words echo in my mind, Lith talks out loud to all of us sitting in the chairs in front of his desk.</p>
<p class="cnNjNGE5ZWJkNzk4NDRlYzRiZmI3ZWIxNDM3MDRjNjVi" data-original-margin="">"Looks like the whole crew is finally all together in one place. Now, let's get down to business and finish up these final negotiations. We have a continent to conquer, don't we?"</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDFhNDhmMDYzYTRlZWJhYjY2M2MyM2IyZGViZDkx" data-original-margin="">His gaze turns to me, and I reply, rehashing the same deals we spoke of in our last 2 negotiation conversations, moving back and forth on the numbers a few more times before we come to a final agreement.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTllYTIwYTZmMjQ4MmI5MWI5ZTI2OTA4ZWEzZjVh" data-original-margin="">I restate it out loud while standing up and putting out my right hand to shake his.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTg5ZDcwM2YwZDQ5OTE4MTcxMTMwY2RhODQ4MzMz" data-original-margin="">"So, before we discuss the actual details of Sector 2, let's get our numbers straight. We will keep 100% of the profits from all trade deals with the other sectors and regions from the mainland outside the walls. The only exception will be trades to Sector 1. You will only pay the price it costs my craftsmen to make it up to 100 Platinum per month in product. After that, it's 50% off market price indefinitely as long as I still retain a 30% or greater profit margin on those goods."</p>
<p class="cnNjNDg2NmFhNTBjNjQ1YmQ5ZWNlNmIwNDYyNWI2YjFl" data-original-margin="">Lith nods and brings his hand closer, replying.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTY2MWIyZDAyOTQ5ZTJiYWRlYTVhZDE3Y2FkZTFl" data-original-margin="">"Yes, and in return, I am allowed to post as many guards as I wish around the Sector 2 Territory, but none will be allowed within 500 meters of your main distribution center or base of operations wherever it may be. Along with this, you may hire your own craftsmen and do as you wish as long as I continue receiving the product I need to maintain my business here in Sector 1. My mercenaries need gear, and the shops and businesses I sell to need my product as well."</p>
<p class="cnM4OGU4NDlhMTAxMzQ2NzY5YzQ1MTk5YjEyZWJkNTk4" data-original-margin="">I nod, bringing my hand closer too.</p>
<p class="cnMyNGVjMzVmMDkyZDQwNGI5ZjI1YzQ1NDliMDQ4ZDA4" data-original-margin="">"Of course. In return, you'll be the 3rd party broker for the Sector 3, Vice Region, and Apex Region deals the first month of business, as they are more familiar with you as a business associate. But after this, you will introduce me to the main contacts under an alias so I can maintain trade with them long term."</p><p class="cjc2MTJiOGMwN2RhNTQ5YzJhMjBhOWM2YjBhZGNhMTJk" data-original-margin="">If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzY2ZDkxMWM0MzQ3ZDM4ZjEzMGFjMmExNjkxMDRm" data-original-margin="">Our hands are so close to shaking I can feel the heat coming off his palm as he replies.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWRiNTkxNTEyNDQyOTE5MGM3ZDc4NTU0Y2I2MWM5" data-original-margin="">"Yes, all this, and I grant you access to all my amenities here in the Galeheart mercenary guild, and you will kill The Dark One. There is no time limit, but of course, sooner than later. You know as well as I do after facing those Arena Monsters this is an urgent matter."</p>
<p class="cnNmMzZiOTAzMzIxNjRmMTg4ZGE3ZmUxNTliYmExMzA0" data-original-margin="">I grip his hand as we both stand over the desk and smile at each other, knowing we're both about to profit heavily from this arrangement. I reply.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWExY2Y0OTJhODQwNDM5NjA2YjhhMmEzNTQ3OTY3" data-original-margin="">"You have my word. Give me the means to get strong and rich enough, and I'll personally deliver The Dark One's head on your desk at my earliest convenience."</p>
<p class="cnNmYTEzOGU1NDljOTRlYzJhNmZkNzMyNGQwNzU2MTFi" data-original-margin="">We both let out a laugh and give a firm handshake before sitting back in our chairs facing each other to discuss the fine details of the arrangement.</p>
<p class="cnNlODA5MWM3YjRhMDQzMjNiNDczMTA5ZGM4NmFlNDg3" data-original-margin="">Maria and Abby are happy to continue training in the Arena, stacking money and training their new abilities for the time being. They don't explicitly say what abilities they're training because of all the people in the room, but it's clear to me they want to refine their Qi control to the point where they can beat the 7th Stage without the help of the Red Hydra's Buff.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjRkZTg1ZjQ2MDQwYTBhYTM3ZjFlMmUxMTZmODM3" data-original-margin="">I agree that this is a good idea for them for the time being, but I won't be joining.</p>
<p class="cnNkZmY5ZWNhZDcwODRjYTg5OWY2ZjJhZGNhNDhiZDUw" data-original-margin="">As much as I'd like to test my own power in the Arena again, I'm certain it's a bad idea. I know I could beat a Ghoul now with my Qi control alone, and most likely face off against a Wraith in the 8th stage too without much issue, but I haven't even begun to awaken my own Soul Energy, so there's no way I can stack up against the true enemy in this city.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWU4N2U0YWU2MzQ2ZWJiNTE2NjQxM2NiZGI0ZTU3" data-original-margin="">Showing off my new power is just asking for trouble, so, I speak up in the middle of our discussion, turning to Fisher and Lydia.</p>
<p class="cnNjNGU5ODUwZTY1MjRkYzk4Y2VmMzNkYzgzZjVjYWY2" data-original-margin="">"I'd rather venture out and see Sector 2 for myself. What's it really like out there?"</p>
<p class="cnM5MWUzOGE3MjJmMTQxOThhZmZjMTMzYmNjNzhiMmNi" data-original-margin="">Fisher replies with arms crossed and a confident smirk.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDcxMTU0OTcyYzQ2N2Y4YzIyMzYxZGRhOGY3Njkz" data-original-margin="">"Oh yeah? You want to be on the front line of the clean-up patrol out there with us too? It's really a chaos-filled wasteland, I already told you."</p>
<p class="cnMwMGI1NDdiYTk2NDQwMWY4NTMyOTliMmRiY2E2YTIz" data-original-margin="">I chuckle.</p>
<p class="cnNmNGU1ZDRhYzc3NDQ2YjZiNGQwODU3MTNkYWM2ZTZi" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, I'd like to know. What'd you two see..."</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2EwZjVhODQ5MjQwY2JhZTgwYThkMGM0NmZhM2Fk" data-original-margin="">Lydia pulls out a few sheets of paper from her item box and spreads them out on Lith's desk while Fisher begins to explain.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmQ2ODk5NjkyYjQ3NTk4ZTEwZmExM2Q2ODJiYTU1" data-original-margin="">"Well, if you see here in the outer regions of Sector 2, the portion at least that borders Sector 1, it's mostly a wide-open desert."</p>
<p class="cnM4MzQ4ZjFmZTdiOTQxODA5ZGViNmFjOWM1YmNkNWFm" data-original-margin="">Abby pokes her head into the conversation too.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjExMGM3ZGY0NTQ3MjBiODY2YmQ1MDc0ZmEwYWRi" data-original-margin="">"So, similar to the landscape we explored initially in Sector 4?"</p>
<p class="cnM5NzM2ZTVlODVlYTQzMWU5MmZmY2ExMGI0YTgyN2Y4" data-original-margin="">Fisher nods.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDYwOTlkOTU1NTQyOWViZjQyOGMxOWNiYzNiMjEz" data-original-margin="">"Kind of. When Lydia and I first made our way out to survey the land, everything seems pretty tame. Every 20 to 50 kilometers or so, there was another small village or settlement connected by stone or dirt roads for trade."</p>
<p class="cnNkNmY2MzQwOTg2NjQ0Njk4YzFhMjk4ZDdhYjc4NzMw" data-original-margin="">Lydia interjects.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDZjMDg2MjJiNzQzODlhOWRkMjk3YWYzNzUyM2E1" data-original-margin="">"However, after about 2 days of travel into the Sector, some of the settlements ended up being abandoned or burned to ash. More crime and looting became rampant the closer to the center of the sector we came, it was so odd."</p>
<p class="cnMzMGRkMDJlOGI5YTQyNTliN2NkZGU1Y2NiODg4NWMx" data-original-margin="">Fisher nods and picks up from there.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjE5MWVjYTJlYTQzYzQ4MDc4ZDRlMTZlMjFmNmY1" data-original-margin="">"After 4 days in, not a single town wasn't covered in graffiti or burned to the ground, only the larger settlements we found even had people left in them. Even those were lawless. Plenty of merchants and normal villagers were fleeing to try to get to Sector 1 or move toward Sector 4 in a hurry."</p>
<p class="cnM2MmU3MWMyNTQyZjQ4NWVhZjIwYTRlNWY0NzhmODNj" data-original-margin="">I raise an eyebrow at this.</p>
<p class="cnNmODUzODU5YTgyNTRmYmNiM2M4NmIxZmQzN2NhMWFk" data-original-margin="">"So it's all pretty recent? People are moving because of something?"</p>
<p class="cnM4NWFhYmViMjZmOTRhMGFiNTE0OWQ5NDM0ZTk2OWZk" data-original-margin="">Lydia replies.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODZiNWI1OGU3MDQyMDZiOGFkZTBiMzIzYjZmMzk2" data-original-margin="">"I think it's just the lack of authority in the main Sector 2 Capital."</p>
<p class="cnM5MjBjZjRmNDdlNDRlN2ZhZGUyZDcxZmRmMzhhMjIy" data-original-margin="">Fisher nods slowly and explains.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTI5NjA0ODU3ZjQzYmE5YjU1MGNiMGQyOGU2MmIy" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, when we got to the Capital, it was already overrun with thugs, crime, and monsters. Plus, everyone is on edge with the Abyss approaching too."</p>
<p class="cnNkN2JhMTNiMzFiNzQxZWE5ZWQyODdiMGE5NjU2ODlm" data-original-margin="">Arie's eyes perk up at the mention of the Abyss, but Maria butts in with excitement for the first time in this conversation at the mention of something earlier in Fisher's statement.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDNlZDNjMzUxMTQzNTBhZWNkMDhkNTdiMmE5NGRm" data-original-margin="">"Monsters? In the City? Outside of dungeons?"</p>
<p class="cnNjZjczZGFmMmI5ODRkMzRiNGI0MmIzNWMwZjZjZDk4" data-original-margin="">Fisher proudly replies.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjA2NjA0ZTc2NjQwNmM4Yjc4MDQ0NjFhYzc4MTk5" data-original-margin="">"That's right. The Capital is right next to a canyon in the desert that goes deeper than even my own vision could see. Lydia and I tried to explore it a bit, but turned back before we got lost. It's truly massive. There are hundreds of dungeons inside it, but some of them have recently had breaks, so monsters flooded out from the canyon and took over parts of the city."</p>
<p class="cnNlOWRkNTg5ODIzMjRiOWFiOTg0YzNiMTljNDg3YzFi" data-original-margin="">Lydia adds to Fisher's point.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjE0YzZiNjlhOTRhZGJiMzRiNGE4M2I0OGVmZTQw" data-original-margin="">"It's dangerous for low-levels to roam the streets alone. The only reason people stay in the city is because of the abandoned warehouses. The Sector 2 leader has many materials and experimental magic items locked away in various underground and aboveground secret locations all over the Capital. Rogue Hunters anywhere from level 50 to level 500 have made their own gangs and search parties all over the city to try and strike gold. There are human wars and monster wars happening every day in that hellhole."</p>
<p class="cnMyOTVjYjNlZWQ3MzRlYjU4YjYzMDgwMzMwMDc4YjM2" data-original-margin="">Fisher points out the portion of the papers where maps of the Capital city are drawn.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWQ2MTA4MzRhNjRjODhhM2IxNTgwOTRlNDFkZWQ5" data-original-margin="">"This is the best we could do, but the location of monster attacks, gang raids, and newly discovered warehouses are changing every day. The longer we spent there, the worse it got."</p>
<p class="cnMyZGIyODFmYWUwNzQ1ZTliNmU3OWQ3MjBmZTU0M2Fk" data-original-margin="">He lets out a sigh. Then, sits back into his chair and crosses his arms.</p>
<p class="cnNlZmVlNjJhOGM2MTRkNzhiYTU5M2ZkYjVjYzZkZDNj" data-original-margin="">Lydia takes a similar stance.</p>
<p class="cnMzODU0YzQxZDE0NDQ3YWZiNmRlODQ3NDgwOTdjOWEw" data-original-margin="">"We're all strong, we can handle cleaning that place up if you really think it's worth it. But, it's not going to be easy."</p>
<p class="cnNkZmRkMWYyNTU3NjQ2NWRhNjQwN2ZlYzE4ZGM0NjRl" data-original-margin="">After this, everyone sits and thinks about their words for a full 30 seconds before I speak up to reply.</p>
<p class="cnMyODZiNjQ2M2U4OTQ4MjY4Y2Q3OGNkMmJhODM5YTA2" data-original-margin="">"I don't want to spend another second in Valor City, and the sound of hundreds of new dungeons to be explored definitely piques my interest..."</p>
<p class="cnNlNGRiNWJjNzQxYzQzMmJiMGQ4NjE3MGExODkzZDcz" data-original-margin="">I scratch my chin, but follow up my statement pretty quickly.</p>
<p class="cnMxODg2MDlkZDcwNTQ3MDNiZTI5ZDY3NmE2YTRlNjc5" data-original-margin="">"I'll check it out and help with the cleanup, sounds like a good opportunity to me. I'm in."</p>
<p class="cnM1OTk2ZTVlOWQzZjRjYmE5MTIwNjI3ODQ5MjRhYzNi" data-original-margin="">Lydia smiles.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjIzZmJkNDdiZTQxNTc5MWZiYjQ1MWI2NmJjZGEy" data-original-margin="">"Great."</p>
<p class="cnM4M2E1ZGNhODFkMTRiYmM4YWY1ZTI1NGI4MWU3YWMz" data-original-margin="">Fisher grins.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2JjNzE5ZjFhYzRmOWRhODRlMWIxNzFmNmJjYTA0" data-original-margin="">"Looks like you'll be getting down and dirty with us after all, Jay, I can't wait to see what kind of fighting style you've grown into."</p>
<p class="cnMyMmJkNzdlYmMwYTQ5NmJiMjBlZDkxYmI5ZmM5MTM3" data-original-margin="">Then, out of the blue, Arie speaks up for the first time this whole meeting.</p>
<p class="cnMyZmUxOWY3MTUzOTQyZDI4MjVkOWE5NmJhYTNlYzA3" data-original-margin="">"If the Abyss is close by, I'll join too."</p>
