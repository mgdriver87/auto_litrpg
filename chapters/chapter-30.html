<p class="cnNmNDY2ODg3ZDNiYzRiMDNhNTMyMWIxOTIwYjA4M2Uw" data-original-margin="">It was much faster than the normal monsters I faced earlier today. I definitely had to come up with a new battle plan.</p>

<p class="cnMwNjVjY2MwNThlMjQxYjlhZTQzMGM1MmQ1MzI0NTJm" data-original-margin="">It wasn't slowing down one bit.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjc4Y2VjNDg3MzQzZTM4MjQ1ZWRjNmQ5NTk4NTU2" data-original-margin="">The monster was less than 20m away now. It's time to move. I decided to match its movements and sprinted towards the oncoming beast.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTEyNWRmNmRmZDRjODY4MTFkODZlY2U3MDE2YmU5" data-original-margin="">When I was about 5m away I made a sharp left turn and narrowly avoided the massive club. I could feel the strong wind against my face. It was an impressive swing.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmY0MzI1Nzc5MTRjMWRiYTJjODhlMTg4YTMwNDE0" data-original-margin="">I turned to face the monster as it charged passed me. I tried to catch it off guard but to my surprise it was already turning to face me as well. Cheap tricks are not going to work.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2ZlOGMyODYzYTRjNDI4YjZlY2EzZmY2MTQ1MmVm" data-original-margin="">We glared at each other and both lunged in to make another attack. It's club was so massive, almost 3m long. I couldn't get anywhere near the beast, it had perfect defense.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2FjZDNkNWJhNDQzMjdiNTQyMjg5MWQ3OTI4OGJj" data-original-margin="">I had to dodge again, there's nothing else I can do. The familiar wind of the club's swing hit my face. I was getting a bit frustrated. I can't afford to get hit by this mutant, its attack is definitely stronger than my previous opponents.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjg4OGQ0YzQzZDQ3NzQ4YzBlM2Y3MTBhYzNjNTA2" data-original-margin="">We faced each of again. Both of us were standing close by the flowing stream on flat ground. The valley's upward hill was to my left.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWMxMzFiNGE1YzRkNGE5MjIzOGM3ZjRhOTNjOTc0" data-original-margin="">As we charged towards each other this time, I decided to dodge early and run up the side of the incline.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTEwZWE1MmI3MzRjMGE5YjczYWYzMmJlOWIzZjFm" data-original-margin="">The beast skidded to a halt and changed directions to follow me up the hill. Thankfully it's lack of agility gave me a small head start.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDcwYjk2MTFkYjRjZjE5N2VlZjEzOGNkZmRhOTAx" data-original-margin="">I ran up the valley's edge as the massive cyclops followed.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzE0MDU2YzFmZjQ1ZTY5OTNmMWE4MzBiYjc1YWFk" data-original-margin="">Once I got enough distance I turned to face it and ignited my entire body into flames. My grip tightened around the fiery sword and I took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWFkZGQ3NDVjNzQ5YmViMWUxZDQzNjUxOWYxMzIx" data-original-margin="">I sprinted forward and jumped in the air with all my strength. The cyclops was still bellowing towards me from below with its club raised.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODAzNWZkMzI4NzQwZDQ4NzE1MzAzYTYxMWFiZGVk" data-original-margin="">As I jumped down the valley I raised my sword for an attack. I was aiming to fly over the entire monster and land behind it for a chance to strike.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjNkMjljMDM4ZjRiZGM5OTlmYjBjNGRkOWE1Yjkx" data-original-margin="">That was my plan anyways...</p>
<p class="cnM5M2E4YWVjZjkyNTRkZjc4MmNhN2E2MGEyNjczYzBk" data-original-margin="">The monster let out a roar and raised its club high into the air.</p>

<p class="cnMzMmI4MTU2YjU1ZTRkNDk4MDM3MzIzOWIwMzFiM2Qz" data-original-margin="">The club hit me like a brick wall. At the last moment I did my best to block some of the spikes with the flat side of my own blade, but it didn't help much.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjVlOGNmNzQ1NzRjZjVhMDc4MmQ2Y2I0OThkYjYz" data-original-margin="">I was sent flying backwards behind the beast hitting the rocky ground just meters from the water's edge.</p>

<p class="cnNmOGQ0YWFhZWQzZDQ4NWRiZDMxZTFjN2U3MTNmNzU1" data-original-margin="">The monster gave me no time to think.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjYxOGM0ZTgwMjQ3ZTRhOGFjZGMxNjYzZjdjYmUw" data-original-margin="">I spat out dirt and blood while readying my sword. I looked up to see the quickly approaching mutant cyclops.</p>
<p class="cnM0Yjg0NmFlNTM1MzQ3OThhMWUyMWNjNDk0ODk3MTNm" data-original-margin="">I have to try again.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTI3NDAxOWRjZDQwYTY4NDQ3MTE4NmQ2ZDJkYzkw" data-original-margin="">The beast kept charging, and I kept waiting.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDk3ODBkMDJmMTRhNjRiNjc0MWQ1NzRiNDY4N2I1" data-original-margin="">When we were no more than 5 meters apart I used all of my speed and agility to sprint and twist away from the massive incoming club.</p>
<p class="cnMwMWZlNDM2Njc2NjRmMjdhYTA4ODFiNWFkYTdiODYz" data-original-margin="">Without looking back I ran full force up the side of the valley. I heard water splashing behind me.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTMwYmRmY2U0YTQ2YTJiZGI2MWVmNTJjOTkxYzBk" data-original-margin="">As I ran about 15m up the hill I turned to face the monster. I expected it to be close behind and starting its charge. What I saw brought a wide grin to my face.</p><p class="cmYzYWM0YTA5ZmMzMDQ5NDhiMmYxNjAyMzljYWU0NzA4" data-original-margin="">If you spot this narrative on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzJkZmVmYmQ5ZjQwODJiMzZkMzAxNzEwNDE4Yjhm" data-original-margin="">The monster overstepped its last attack on me and ran into the stream.</p>
<p class="cnM3N2E2YjA0ZWI3OTQxMTdhMTQ4OTkyYWFjM2NhOGNm" data-original-margin="">It took a few extra seconds for the monster to recover and turn. It was just starting its charge up the valley now.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDVlMzM2MTAzNjRhOGVhMWNlMDcxOGI5YTA3ZWUw" data-original-margin="">I smirked and ignited into flames again. This time I had an advantage. I was moving much faster, and had more time to position my airborne attack.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTIzZTkxN2YyMDQzYmM5NWVhMGE1YWM1Mjk0MTA0" data-original-margin="">I waited longer to jump and focused more force on getting higher up rather than farther this time.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTVkODVhZWY3NDQzM2ZhYzJjYWZkZmMxNDY5Nzhl" data-original-margin="">The cyclops let out a roar as it made its attempt to smack me down with a swing of its club.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzA5ZjQ2Mjg4MjQ2MjM5MjJiZmZlODc1MDNiZjA0" data-original-margin="">It missed. My plan worked.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmM5OGEzZmU3MDQ2MzE4ZTdlNTQxODM4MTUzM2Q2" data-original-margin="">I landed directly behind the monster and planted my right foot to jump up towards its head.</p>
<p class="cnNkODI5MzgxMGE0YTQ0OTFhNzI1NzhlMjZlMDYzOTdh" data-original-margin="">The cyclops had already come to a halt and was trying to turn around.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmEzYmNjNjA2NjRjODE5NzQxMDY4MWVlMDhlZjY1" data-original-margin="">I focused all the fire I could into the tip of my blade and pierced the back for the monster's head. I let out a cry as I released as much fire as I could into the beast.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDUwMzg3M2YyNTRmZTk5ODZlMzFlMWU2Mjk4NjZj" data-original-margin="">"TAKE THISSSS!!!"</p>

<p class="cnMxOGJmYTc0OTI2MTQxZjVhYzIzZjRkODc3NmUwM2Y4" data-original-margin="">It thrashed around for a few seconds as I repeatedly stabbed it and released fire into the beast's body.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmVmMGIyYWFhYTQyNmNiODU1M2ExZWIxMmE4OTBk" data-original-margin="">It couldn't shake me off.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDM1MWQyZDhlMjQwNDViNDA5N2EyNTQzM2ZjN2Iw" data-original-margin="">The mutant decided to swing its own club at the back of its head aiming to crush me.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDU0ZTg3NTRlYzQxNmM5OThkZWE5OTgwZDEzOTY2" data-original-margin="">My eyes went wide and I jumped back ripping the fiery blade from its flesh. I fell to the ground as the beast bashed its own head in with its club.</p>
<p class="cnM4MWU2NzUzMjc5YTQ5ODFiNzhlZWI2NTZmNDZhOWUz" data-original-margin="">I ran back towards the river. It's better that I get to flat ground now, this thing is mad.</p>

<p class="cnM0MzY5MjAzNmYzYjQ0MDJhM2FjYzM2ZTViY2ViMTVj" data-original-margin="">To my surprise the mutant was still standing. It was slowly walking towards me with steady loud stomps.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjM3MjgwNzgzODRiMWJhNDMxZjYxNDAzMTc1MDlh" data-original-margin="">Its head was caved in from the direct swing of its own club and the backside was still on fire due to the leftover magic residue.</p>
<p class="cnMyMGM4OWI3MjZmZTQ2OTY5M2M5OGExMDc1MGU5Njcy" data-original-margin="">Its eye was bleeding and cloudy, but it still stood tall ready to continue our battle to the death.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjlkYzAzM2E5YTRlY2Y4YTFlYmRlMTc4NDEyMDg0" data-original-margin="">I have to give it credit, this monster is a tough one.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTk5NmY1NzBhMjQ1Y2M5M2FmMTRlNDM3NjI2NGMx" data-original-margin="">I was breathing heavy and bleeding all over as well. I couldn't help but to grin a little bit.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmE4NjBiY2UwNTQzZGNiY2UxM2Y3YjU5MGU2MWQ4" data-original-margin="">The beast ran towards me, but not in a straight line. There was something off...</p>
<p class="cnNkMzI5ZGQyZDM1ZDQ3OWE5MWI1N2E5NzE4NjhiZTYw" data-original-margin="">It can't see...</p>
<p class="cnNhNzIzOWU3NTkxNjQ0YTNiMWNmZmMyZjk1MDQ3NTUz" data-original-margin="">The beast was swinging its club and blindly attacking where I was last standing.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjRiMDQxZTJlNzQ3NDhhNmMzM2JjYjRlNmJhMjM3" data-original-margin="">I nodded slowly realizing the situation.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGVkYzRmZjcxNDQwZWQ4YWNiN2VjNzU2NmRkYjMy" data-original-margin="">A well fought battle indeed. Without the valley's geographical advantage I would have never won. Thanks to my surroundings I've defeated this monster.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDQ2YTllMDZlNDRlYTE4MmRlZGQ4MjUwODcyNTBk" data-original-margin="">With a swift fiery maneuver I ran up the valley's incline again without the cyclops even noticing me.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjBjNGI4OTMxOTRkYjliNjY1MDFiYjUwNTgxNzUw" data-original-margin="">I focused every last bit of fire I had into the blade and jumped at the monsters backside.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTI5MjNhMGQ4ODQyNmM5M2I0YzNjODdlODdjZGY5" data-original-margin="">I pierced the same spot in the back of its head and let my fire burn bright.</p>
<p class="cnNiODFhMzA4ZDJmMDQ3MjE4NmE2ZjY3ODJjMzA1ZWU4" data-original-margin="">With this silent strike the monster fell to its knees, then its head fell to the rocky floor.</p>
