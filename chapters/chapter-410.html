<p class="cnM0ZTQ0NWM5OGUwOTRlNWE4MjZmYTE4YmZjYzA4NmU0" data-original-margin="">I pull it out of my storage and use telekinesis to let it hover above my left hand.

<p class="cnMyNzcxOTlkOTY4MTQwYTRhZWUzMmE5YWQ2YTc5ODg3" data-original-margin="">A bright white light flashes and the wisps of wind around the stone only grow larger.</p>

Even Ember reacts to the huge disturbance in energy, opening our telepathy link as I recharge my MP from the surrounding dungeon air while the tornado-filled stone plummets to the ground.</p>

The closer I get to it, the faster I feel my mana being drained again. I activate my own plunderer skill to try and counteract its pull, but my MP bar barely manages to stay over 20% even while all my buffs are activated to help my skill's efficiency.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjFhODc0YmUwYjQxYjNhZThlN2RmYjk4OWU4OTk0" data-original-margin="">This is more than enough for me to open up an item storage portal underneath the falling stone and its volatile absorption mixed with swirling energy ceases once it falls inside.</p>

<p class="cnM1MTM3MGQ4MTZkZTRjNzQ5MGZiNTA0MjIxZTRlNjkx" data-original-margin="">"Maybe. By nature, cursed items are unpredictable. It's what occurs when powers that shouldn't be mixed are forced together. Whether the strength between an attribute and the material are unique and different, or possibly the quality gap between the material and skill being imbued are too far apart. Cursed, or uncontrollable items with minds of their own, will appear when an item that is not supposed to be crafted comes into this world."</p>
<p class="cnM5N2U4ZTk0YjE4OTQ1YzhiNDRmNmMwYjVlNmE2N2Fi" data-original-margin="">The wind flies by us on both sides as Ember breaks through the cloud line again and continues.</p>

I recommend you test that stone out on something before attempting to collapse a Titan's Domain. It'd be smart to test it and watch from afar to make sure there aren't any hidden traps."</p>
<p class="cnMxNjhkZDQyYzVkYjQ2ODViZDg2MWYyYWNjYzMxMjUw" data-original-margin="">I cross my arms and stay quiet for a moment, then finally reply.</p>
