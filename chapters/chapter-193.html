<p class="cnNkMjljMzE1YWIzMzQ1NDk5YWQxZmNmNTIyNDc5MDM4" data-original-margin="">I gulp, then deactivate my teleportation skill. That confirms it. The boss room has been defeated and the cooldown timer is real.</p>

<p class="cnNiYzhkNmNhOWYwNTRjY2M4NjUxMjAxMjhjMDY2ZWUz" data-original-margin="">Seconds later, I fall to the ground. My sword hits a hard white flooring with a loud clang as I catch myself with two open palms.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDQxYmY5NDRiYzQ3MDVhNGM2YTdiYmVmYmFhOGJh" data-original-margin="">My ears are still ringing and my breathing is heavier than ever. My vision is blurry, but I can see my own crimson blood dripping onto a glossy white surface below me.</p>
