                <p class="cnNkNzkwMTY0NzIwZDRkYzViNTIzYWVkYTg2NmY5NjEy" data-original-margin="">I put on a smile as Rylan continues to hold his arm around my shoulder tightly. We walk over to the nearest wooden table being offered to us by the old cheerful Innkeeper.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWY1MjQzZGVkMTQ2ZTA5Y2JlMGQ1Y2Y3MzAxODRm" data-original-margin="">"Sit down boys, it's hot off the stove!"</p>
<p class="cnM2OThmMmIxMjZmYTQ5OGNiZTg1OTkwNzYxMDMyZTdj" data-original-margin="">Rylan releases me from his grip and takes a seat, I start to sit down as well and the old man continues talking.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTBkMWQwZjNmZTRmZmRhNGQ1MGMzZTIyNDU4YjBm" data-original-margin="">"I know you wanted some time to rest, but I thought you could use a good meal right about now, was I wrong?"</p>
<p class="cnM1MzZlZmE4MzI4MjRkNzM5OWJmMWJkMzQyMjk3YTZm" data-original-margin="">I chuckle and take my seat, hearing my stomach gurgle at the sight of steaming hot food and cold drinks in front of me.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjNmNzdiZmNmZDQyMTA5MDgyMzk1NDM5YzdlNDlm" data-original-margin="">"No, you weren't wrong at all. I appreciate it, Conway."</p>
<p class="cnM0MjZjMGNhMGQ4OTRmZTJhZjYzNGViOTY2NDNkODll" data-original-margin="">With a slight bow, the kind innkeeper turns and waves as he walks into the back room behind his check-in counter.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDk3NTI0Y2FmZjQ2ZDc5YTBjNTllYzlkNGQxYjhj" data-original-margin="">"Welcome back Jay, enjoy."</p>
<p class="cnM5MzYxYjQ3NzhiMzQ4MDNiYTcwN2M2MDY3OTkyNGI5" data-original-margin="">I let out a sigh with my eyes locked on the meal in front of me, then dig in.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjIyMDUzMjc2MzQzYjhiOTMzYzJhOGM0NmFiMDUx" data-original-margin="">I pay no mind to any of the hunters eating their meals and trading goods on the tables nearby. Even Rylan's presence begins to leave my conscious thoughts as I become fixated on the meal before me.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzc4NzFlMTRlYjQxMDJiNTcxZTIwOThlYzMxMTYw" data-original-margin="">Every bite rejuvenates me more and more. I'm fully invested, body and mind.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmIxMzBhYzdjODRiYThhNzdiZWM0NjM3ZDAwOTEz" data-original-margin="">Over 10 minutes pass before the redhead's voice finally hits my ear.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGY2YzRlMGI3MzRlM2Q4NTRmMmQ5ZDFjZGY0NmZh" data-original-margin="">"Hey Jay, want to hear something wild?"</p>
<p class="cnM4MGMyMjVkODNlZDQ1ZjI4ZGE4MDM1MThjNzFlMTA0" data-original-margin="">I look up, beginning to feel much more satisfied. I shake myself out of the small trance and sit back while replying.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjIzN2Y5ZjIwNzQ3M2ZhMDRkMTZiNWFiYmUzZGUy" data-original-margin="">"Sure...What's up?"</p>
<p class="cnNiYWRiNDQ2ZDc5YTQwNTM4NjJiOTc1NDU4MjM3YTg2" data-original-margin="">Rylan crosses his arms, looking a bit annoyed.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2RiOGVkN2FkNjQwZWRiMzk1YzlhNmUxMmU3MjU1" data-original-margin="">"Remember those nobles we ran into the other day before you went off o your own? Apparently, they made it up to the 19th floor, just like you. They took out a ton of the base-level monsters. Can ya believe that?"</p>
<p class="cnMzZmZmZGNhZDY3ZDRjYTZiOTIzZTRkMWNhMDIwNDYx" data-original-margin="">I raise an eyebrow, then rely in a low tone.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzE4NjdmZWJkNDQxNzY4ZWM4Njg2YzFkZTRiNjEy" data-original-margin="">"Hmph. Really?"</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTRhMWJjMDMwZTQzMzU4MzI5NDQxNGQ5NmVjOWVj" data-original-margin="">He nods, placing both hands back on the wooden table.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmMwZjNmZjNiODRjY2RhNjBiYTFjMjk1OWE3MmRi" data-original-margin="">"Yeah, they even passed through to our resting camp with a collection of really rare swords. They must have really killed a lot of them!"</p>
<p class="cnM1Njk5OWNkNThjMTRkOWM5OWE2Mjk4MzA1ODc4MjU4" data-original-margin="">I slowly nod, thinking to myself.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzNkMDVhNDI2NzQ2OGJiYTEyZGZhODEzYjM5Yzcx" data-original-margin="">Those nobles didn't seem that strong to me. Their levels were nowhere near high enough and I've even fought their leader back when I had no mana control training at all... and I was a near-even match for him.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjM2Y2JhODIzMDQ0OTFiMjJiZDU3Y2YxNTJhOTBi" data-original-margin="">Something isn't adding up, but it's not my biggest concern at the moment. He's probably just collecting gear for his family to sell or something, it's none of my business.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTlhN2ViN2M4NjRmN2Y4NzlmMWQxNDQyNTQ3ZDVj" data-original-margin="">Although my 10 minutes of bliss while eating were nice, now the real problem at hand has to be figured out.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDVhYWRlODE3MzQ4ZTk5OWYyZGEzMTk2ZmE0YzE2" data-original-margin="">The fact that the 20th Floor Boss supposedly has a 7-day cooldown timer is rather troubling. I won't take Rylan's word for fact, but it's more than enough for me to worry about the possibility of it being true.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWRlOTY3MWQ1MDRlNjM4Nzc4NjM5MzZhMDE1NjM2" data-original-margin="">I clench my jaw, then speak up.</p>
<p class="cnM1Zjg3ZDg3NjcyMDQ2YjY5MTFlMDNmNGMyMTA2ZTdl" data-original-margin="">"Hey, do you know when Fisher is getting back? I- I wanted to see if I could face the 20th Floor boss..."</p>
<p class="cnNlNzBiY2NhNmFiZjRhZDlhZGFhMzA1MzlhMDY3MThl" data-original-margin="">I create a small item storage portal beneath the table and pull out the small white transport crystal the blue-haired Elite gave me before he left, then put it up in front of Ryan's eyes.</p><p class="cjNjNTM0ODIxM2FlNTRmN2Q4ZjQyYmNlYjNiOGRhZDJi" data-original-margin="">This narrative has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. If you see it on Amazon, please report it.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGQxMmQyM2FmMjQwMjBiNTllM2Q2MDk3OTQ2OWM0" data-original-margin="">"Or ya know, I could face it myself if he takes too long. I still haven't used my emergency exit."</p>
<p class="cnNjY2YzNjQ3ZjA0YjQyNjBhNzhkZGNlMzNlZWZlZDM0" data-original-margin="">I smirk and put the crystal down, but don't get the response I expected. Rylan pauses for a moment, the replies in a softer tone.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGUwODNjNTlkYjRjN2NhYjMzNTFmZDE4MDRkOGMz" data-original-margin="">"There's... been no word from Fisher or any of the others in his Elite squad that left a few days back. They should have returned by now..."</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTRiYzdlOWQ1OTQyOGVhZmYyMzI0MDIwYmM1YTI0" data-original-margin="">I nod slowly, catching onto his serious tone. The redhead continues.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmQ4NjE0ZDY5MTRjMjA4YzE4M2E5ZmY4NzVlYzIz" data-original-margin="">"I assume they'll still want your new squad in training to go out and help defend the northern border. It's just...</p>
<p class="cnMwYTk1ZWI3YjQ1NzQ3YWQ4YmY2N2QwODVkMDgyZTBi" data-original-margin="">I'm not sure what's taking so long... If they can't finish the job, I don't know how much your squad will help-"</p>
<p class="cnMzZjVhMjYyYzE5MzQ4Y2NiNjM5OWUzN2EzMjc4ZmY2" data-original-margin="">I cut him off.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2NkZTE3NmM1NzQyY2FiMjQ3Zjg5N2RkNDU4YWI1" data-original-margin="">"Got it. Understood."</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjQ0ZDJkZjIwYTQwNWRiYzU4ODQ0ZmRkYjRiNWNk" data-original-margin="">I take a deep breath, faking a look of concern.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWE1MTFlNmIyYTQ4ZWQ5NDUxOTk4OGYyYTZjODJl" data-original-margin="">Rylan looks upset. Fisher was his student, he's probably very worried about his extended absence.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTg0YjMzYWU3MDQ3ODY4NjMyOGNmMDgyZTQ0M2Rm" data-original-margin="">It seems there's some trouble brewing for the Association. First, an urgent mission, and now a full Elite squad is missing...</p>
<p class="cnM4MzE2YzAwZGMxMzQzYzNiNWU1NDYzNDUzMjNiNGQ1" data-original-margin="">Sounds fishy, but this all works out perfectly for me. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect turn of events.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTUwMmQyMWMyODRkMmFhNzcyZjg0Njk3ZTA0MmU4" data-original-margin="">I stand up, looking down on the redhead, and speak in a volume just above necessary to get the attention of hunters at the tables surrounding us with my next line.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjM0ODU5NzQ4ZTQwNDM5MDNlYTc3OGZlNWYyYzBi" data-original-margin="">"Rylan. I'm going to face the 20th Floor Boss. I may not win, but at least I'll know the difficulties ahead. I'll make sure to say hi to Fisher when I see him in the dark continent soon. I'm sure he's fine."</p>
<p class="cnNhYmNkMTUwZjk1ODQxY2ZhNGNhNDhkZmJmNWVkNmQ5" data-original-margin="">The redhead shows me a thin smile and perks up a bit.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzc5Y2I0OGU0MzQzNjBhYjRhNDUzMDU2MTA4OTg4" data-original-margin="">Letting out a sigh, I sit back down and Rylan relaxes as well.</p>
<p class="cnMyY2JhZjgwMzk1ZDQzZDZhMzA3ZTZmZmU0ODhmOTkx" data-original-margin="">We finish up our meal, share small talk about the association, and I throw the white transfer crystal back into my storage after repeatedly assuring Rylan that I'll use it if I get into any trouble while on the higher floors.</p>
<p class="cnNjOTEwNDE3M2JkNzRmMGJiZDMyNzZiZjM4NjMwMWZj" data-original-margin="">In reality, I plan to use it no matter what.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjlmYTc3NzlmNzRlM2Y5NDRjYjNjMmVmMzM0OWU5" data-original-margin="">If that boss room is actually closed off, using the crystal to transport away will be the perfect excuse. I can just say I ran from the fight and that's why the room is closed for any future hunters that try to enter.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTgwNzA3MjUxYjRmODBiYjg4Y2NiMjAwMWMxODk2" data-original-margin="">It's simple, but I don't see how it won't work.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTZiMTMzYjk3MzQ0NzViMWI0YzcxNzIxOTQ3Yjhh" data-original-margin="">My soreness and MP withdrawal effects are much less noticeable by the end of our feast. I can fight at 40-50% now if I needed to. It's great progress, but it feels like it'll take a while to regain my full capabilities. This won't be a quick recovery, time will tell.</p>
<p class="cnM5OWEwNmQ5MDgzNTQ2NWNhM2QzM2ViM2E3ZGIwYjYy" data-original-margin="">I let out a satisfied sigh and turn to Rylan.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTk2YmQ5Njk3NzQzZTFhYjFiNTI3ZTdiMTdiYTM0" data-original-margin="">"Well, now is as good a time as ever for me to get going. Don't ya think?"</p>
<p class="cnM0YTNjZmJjOGUwNzRiNDBhYjgxMTc2YmUxYmZhNGIx" data-original-margin="">With a smirk, I stand up from my chair at the table and put out my hand for the redhead to shake it.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmNjZjU5N2RjNzQ5NTVhNjRkZjQ2MzI0MjBhZmU5" data-original-margin="">He replies, standing up and shaking my outreached hand.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2IxNDJmNjI0MzRkMWQ4YmIwOGFjZWM1YTg0ODg0" data-original-margin="">"Y-You're leaving already?"</p>
<p class="cnMzYjAyMDA4YzY2MjQ4MWJhMTYzOGI2NjJlYjBhYWFj" data-original-margin="">I give him a firm nod.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjM3ODNhOTkwMzQ3ZGM5N2FlMTg1NDYzZTIxZjEx" data-original-margin="">"Might as well. I'm fully rested and have a full stomach, there's no better time to start my journey."</p>
<p class="cnNhMmVmMmFlYjI2MTQ5MWNiMjMxYzMwNDNmNDU2Mjkx" data-original-margin="">I turn around to see the old Innkeeper come out from his backroom right on cue. I take the small metal key out of my pocket as we make eye contact and throw it at him from a few meters away.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTJiNzVhNzk0YjQ3MTJhMjUxMjg1MmQ2MGZmZThl" data-original-margin="">"Appreciate you, old man. I'll be out for a while."</p>
<p class="cnMzYWEwNTRmOGQwMTQ0MzliMDgxNGQwMDM1Nzg0ZWJi" data-original-margin="">Conway catches the key and gives me a firm nod.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzk5ZmJlOGM3ZjRjZjc4ZTEwMWE0ZGQyZjE1ODVj" data-original-margin="">I turn back to Rylan.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjI0M2UxYzdlYjQwMzViYzFjY2NmOTFkMjkzMWUy" data-original-margin="">He gulps.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDI1NjliMWMwYzRiZTQ4MzYwYmI0YjEwY2ViN2Nh" data-original-margin="">"I'm starting to understand why they picked you to become an Elite... You never take a break do you?"</p>
<p class="cnMwNzRhM2U0MGQzNzQxNzViMmJlYjRiNmJiZjNiZjE1" data-original-margin="">I chuckle, turning to the door.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzA2YjcwMGY5NTRlZDQ4NmYzYThhY2JlMmZiZjZj" data-original-margin="">"I guess not."</p>
<p class="cnM3OTU4MGI4MDkxOTRjODY5YTUxZDNjZWE0Njk5MzZm" data-original-margin="">The redheaded hunter waves.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGMwYzA5NGEwODRhODA4MTBhNDMwZDJlNTNmN2U0" data-original-margin="">"Hey Jay, good luck."</p>
<p class="cnMxZmNlNDI1ODc2MTRjZGI5OWQ4MTE2MzEzMmM3OTRi" data-original-margin="">I nod, replying while walking through the tables full of low-level C-Class hunters.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGNlMGVhMWM4MTRkYmM4OWM2YTM4YjQ1NTA0NDM4" data-original-margin="">"Thanks for showing me around Rylan. If I'm not back soon, I'm sure we'll still meet again."</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDA0M2QzMjc4MzQwNTE5NmM0M2Q4ZTAxMTk0Mjk4" data-original-margin="">The poorly crafted wooden door swings open and I walk out into the open air of the dungeon.</p>
<p class="cnNmOWNiYjQ4OWNmMjQzZGRiZjU3NmI0OGJhYmI3MzI2" data-original-margin="">Making a quick right turn, I make my way around the back side of the Inn and begin trekking deep into the 10th floor.</p>
<p class="cnMyZmYxNWUzMGRkZDRjNThhYmNhZWRkNTYxN2RkZTIx" data-original-margin="">Once out of sight, I Dungeon Walk upwards.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDVjMTA1ZjMxYzRjMGM5MTUyYTY0OTk4Y2Q5Yjdm" data-original-margin="">I prepare myself for the sharp pain and exhaustion that follows, but my real reaction isn't as bad as my mental image.</p>
<p class="cnMxZmNlN2EzZGFjYzQ2MmQ5ZmM4NmYxN2NlYjE5YzM0" data-original-margin="">I feel a slight headache for a fraction of a second, and my breathing gets a bit healthier the moment I blip back into reality, but it fades away quickly.</p>
<p class="cnMyOGNiZTZmNDhiNTQyMjE5ZmYzYjQ4YTBhMmQxNzEx" data-original-margin="">I've healed enough to Dungeon Walk without much trouble, this is good.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmJkYmU0YTk3NDQzMjU4NDkzMmIwM2NiMGVmYWMw" data-original-margin="">Although I'd love to check out the 20th and confirm my suspicions as soon as possible, I still have a mana-collecting quota to fill. I need over 20k MP worth of crystals before I think about going back to the Association.</p>
<p class="cnM0NmNkOWI5ZGUwMzQ4OGI4OWE5Njk2NTlhYjc2OTk5" data-original-margin="">I teleport up to the High Ogre Dungeon.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGZhOWQzZmZkNTRjNDViOGZmODc1M2I2YzJmZWY5" data-original-margin="">These will be low 300 leveled monsters. Easy for me to kill, but strong enough to drop decent loot. It shouldn't take more than a few hours to farm what I need, even in my current state.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWFkMGZjZDZhYzRmNWZhZTRlYzk3MjkxNzBkM2Y4" data-original-margin="">I take a deep breath and get to work.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjUzMGQ0M2NkNDQyMTBiOGMzNDA1ZGM5MzU2Mzlk" data-original-margin="">Pulling out my sword and activating my enemy detection skill, I find my first target and teleport over to it.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzZhNjYwYjBhZTQwNTViYmJhMjU5M2Q3NmQ5MmZm" data-original-margin="">It's a High Orge, nothing too special. Nearly 4 meters tall, wearing a full suit of lightweight armor, and wielding its own long silver sword.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjE0MTgwZjkxNTRiMjhhMDVhODQyMmMzZmExMGNj" data-original-margin="">I channel a few hundred MP into an attack and let it fly, slicing the Ogre in two without a hint of resistance.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDRjYWIyMTgxMTQxY2JhYzUwYzAzNzVlMTg2MzNk" data-original-margin="">It falls to the floor moments later, hardly even registering that an attacker appeared. I slowly walk over to its corpse and wait for the monster to dissolve.</p>
