                <p class="cnNjMWJlNDNkMzQ3NTQ3MjRiYWY2MzA2ZTVjMDVmYjFl" data-original-margin="">The injured flaming Minotaurs came charging at me in a fit of rage. These two aren't the problem though. I can doge their attacks all day and kill them whenever I please. Their leader is the real issue. I haven't gauged its full strength yet, but its definitely higher than mine.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2Y4MWRjYmExYjQ4NzViYzhiOTAwNzdiODczOWZh" data-original-margin="">My best course of action is to take these two out first. I have a few healing potions, I can handle another hit or two... I'll use the same strategy as before.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGM3MWQ0ZGNiZDRkMDJhM2YxMDZjZmEyMDkyOWU3" data-original-margin="">We all charged in towards each other.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTgyMDI1ZDZhZjQyYTU4M2I4Y2MzNDNiYmQzMmEz" data-original-margin="">I blocked the two axe hits with my hardened arm and landed another double strike on the two weaker monsters while absorbing some MP in the process.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzlkZjZiMDdiZTQwZTJiNzY2YzQ4NDZiYzNjOTcz" data-original-margin="">The leader was close behind and attacked immediately just like before. I braced myself and tried to concentrate even more hardening on my arm to see if I could block the attack if I had full focus.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTAwNDQ4ZmI3MDQ4YjNiYjVhYzQzNDZlNTU0NTcz" data-original-margin="">The leaders large axe came down and made contact with my ultra hardened arm.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODFmYWVjNGE0MDQwNjM5Nzg3OTBjNTRhZGU3Yzhi" data-original-margin="">"Aggghhh bad idea..."</p>
<p class="cnNmMGE0MmZiNmY3ZTQ5YjJiYWM1YmQxNWJmZWYwNzE5" data-original-margin="">The second it made impact I heard a crack and saw black crystal fragments fly out in all directions while a sharp pain traveled through my arm and into my shoulder.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWViZTRhNjg4MzRmNjRhM2MyNDI5M2E5NDk1ODc0" data-original-margin="">It worked a little bit... but my arm is definitely still fractured in multiple places. I need to get better positioning and try blocking with my sword next time if I get the chance.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTcxY2NhOThlYjRmZjA5ZGY1MDdhMDA4ZmUzMzMz" data-original-margin="">I jumped back and distanced myself to check my stats and regenerate. It read 485/805 HP, and 680/805 MP.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTUwOTZiNmEzMjQxMjhiNWY0Zjk0NjIxOGFkNTY3" data-original-margin="">Not bad.... Just one more time should open things up.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmM4YWUxYTk3ODRlMjhhYWU3MWNkZjZlNmQ0NmU3" data-original-margin="">I charged back in and did a picture perfect attack. The two front Minotaurs fell to the ground in a pool of their own blood and my flames. Three good attacks seems to be just enough for me to defeat normal monsters here.</p>
<p class="cnM3MmViN2Y3ODQ0OTQ1ZjJhMDI4NGNmNDFkZjI5NzQw" data-original-margin="">[Level Up]</p>
<p class="cnNhNGM4MmMxZGRiYjQwZmRiNjc0ODgwNDU2MDFiMjdm" data-original-margin="">I blocked another attack while sacrificing my hardened arm one last time before running back about 20m to recuperate and plan for the actual battle at hand here.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDA1NGVkMzJkZjQ3Njk5OTBiZDVmNjY0ZDAxM2Mw" data-original-margin="">My stats read out 355/810 HP, 685/810 MP. As the lone leader eyed me down I took the time to chug an HP potion back up to full health. I could have waited a bit longer, but it's a common sense safety precaution here.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2Y4YWU0ZDhjNTQyY2ZhOWEzZmU1YmI2N2IyYWZj" data-original-margin="">We both charged forward. I ignited my blade in fire and the beast raised its axe.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzJkMzQwOTgyNTRiMGViNmZjMzFhYTljOGY2YzQy" data-original-margin="">"CLANGGGGGG"</p>
<p class="cnMzNzg4MWJiNzZiMDRlN2I4YjBiMmFmMzZlMzA2NjIw" data-original-margin="">We met weapons with a clash of flames, sparks, and grunts from both sides. In the end, I was totally overpowered...</p>
<p class="cnMwYTdlZjY5Njg0MjRhOWRiOTFmYjUxOWMyZDhjZDhj" data-original-margin="">The monster's axe came crushing down. I held my own in the test of strength for a few milliseconds, but in the end it was a one sided match up. The Minotaurs axe completely trumped my sword's power and it came crashing down towards me with little resistance. I was forced to retreat and jump backwards.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmIyNzUyYzM0YTQwMDk4ZDUwM2U2MGIzYjFjOWEw" data-original-margin="">This feels like some of my old battles... I haven't faced a truly superior opponent in a while. I grinned and stared down the beast as it grunted and started charging towards me again.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTI1MDU2MDU2ZjQ2OGJhMzcwYzg4MzYzZTRhOTQ5" data-original-margin="">I'll have to use my speed to defeat this one, brute strength isn't going to cut it.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTZjOWQ0ZTc2NTRmYjA5YjY1NzhiNzQ0NjAyMmU5" data-original-margin="">I ran forward with my sword ablaze. The monster swung its axe downward and I dodged without attempting to counter it at all. With a swift fiery strike I sliced open its leg as I ran by.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjg1YzRjYWI1YzQ1YjI5NWZlNDU5ODg0NDMzNzJm" data-original-margin="">This is a pretty nostalgic feeling. It's almost like I'm fighting that wolf boss from my home town again. Good times.</p><p class="cjVjNzZlYzRmNWUzZDRmOThiNWI1MGNlNzdlMzc1NGU0" data-original-margin="">The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWYwYWNkMTUwNjQ2OTVhMmI0MTg4MzJlNmVjNGJj" data-original-margin="">I smirked and faced the beast once more. We charged forward and I dodged to the opposite side to land a hit on its other leg. The beast cried out. This wasn't much damage to a monster like this, but it was definitely getting very annoyed.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzE0MzBlZDA5ZjQ0Y2E5NTJmYmMwMGFmNTg4MjZi" data-original-margin="">I continued my assault, switching up my movements and styles to land safe cheap hits every time. It's a pretty boring way to fight, but fighting this thing head on would not be the smart thing to do. I have a very clear speed and agility advantage, there's no point in not using this to my full capacity.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTRkNDNmNGNiODQ2ZGVhM2JmZDNjODU5YzllOWY1" data-original-margin="">Every time I made a slice in the monster's legs I absorbed a small amount of MP. It's much harder to drain than its weaker counterparts. The monster's level must have something to do with it. An opponent with a much higher experience level takes longer to suck MP from. Another good thing to note. I have to leave a large amount of fire residue in every attack I land, I'd be out of MP fast if I didn't have this new skill.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzhhMTJmMWM3MzQ1N2M4ZWUwMzgzZmQzNzkwOWFj" data-original-margin="">After around 10 attacks the Minotaur became visibly slower. I started aiming for its abdomen, then upper chest, and lastly the back of its neck. It look a total of 16 hits before I pierced my fiery blade into its head and watched the beast fall to the ground.</p>

<p class="cnM3ZjI2YTk1ZjIxMzQ2MDdhMTQ4OTM1Y2ZkMDcyNjY4" data-original-margin="">It relied too heavily on the two weaker fighters. When I had a speed advantage and we were all alone the only thing that beast could do was lay down and die. Unfortunate fate.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDgwODVmNmIxMzQ3NWFhYjA1MDI0MDVmYjM2M2U5" data-original-margin="">I've definitely got a handle on this dungeon. That was a level 191. It's probably one of the highest rated I'll find here, and it was taken out with ease.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGYzNzBiZjcwZTQxMTk4NGE4ZDg1M2Q5M2IzOGZh" data-original-margin="">With a satisfied grin on my face I walked over to the two weaker Minotaurs that burned to ash and put their mana crystals in my item storage. As I turned around to collect the leader's mana my eyes lit up.</p>
<p class="cnNjMGM3M2RkY2Y3MDQxMWNhNjRiYWFlZTY0NmFkNmM3" data-original-margin="">Looks like its my lucky day. After only 6 monsters I already got an item drop! The huge axe sat on the ground next to a large mana crystal. I picked each of them up to place in my item storage.</p>
<p class="cnM0YWJjNDBhMDJkOTRkNTY4YmNjNjAyNWYyNGZiNDJh" data-original-margin="">I started walking back in the direction of the dungeon start point. I'm not leaving yet, I'd just rather be nearby for when I decide to leave and not wander too far off into the dungeon. It's not like I'll be fighting the boss today.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTY2YWFhMDViMzQ4MTA4ZThhMTQzMTY0YzM3NmJj" data-original-margin="">On my way back I came across a pair of Minotaurs level 157 and 154. They were very easy opponents, with my recent level increases I was able to take them down in 2 hits each. I didn't level up, but collected two mana crystals.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjNjNDcyNGVhMTQxM2I4OTA1YzExMGFiYTM1NDll" data-original-margin="">As I strolled around the dungeon I got to thinking about what my purpose here in the city really is. After these recent events I have a clear idea of what I have to do.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmUxNTZjMGIzZjQ0MGNiYzc1NDNkNzViNjRiZmY3" data-original-margin="">The C Class exams are in less than 3 weeks. I need to get really serious ... This dungeon is the perfect training ground for my preparation. I'll power level here and make a ton of money from the loot drops to buy some new higher grade gear.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTA2NjQ1YmNjZDRmMzFiODE5MTdjNTEyZDJiOWI1" data-original-margin="">I spent the next 4 hours roaming around the dungeon's start point. This seemed to be the perfect spot for now. I came across 6 more groups of Minotaur.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDAxYjU3Zjc1ZDQ5YWM5OGVjNDI2ZWEyMDE1Mjhi" data-original-margin="">The first was and easy group of 3. They consisted of a level 157, 158, and 162. They dropped 3 mana stones. I didn't level up.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjkzNGIzMzNiYjQ1NWU5YzBmNWFiYjllMmJlODli" data-original-margin="">The second group was a bit more of a challenge. The was a leader at level 183 and two underlings at level 155 and 157. It was a similar battle to the previous trio with a leader. Long, but not that difficult. They only dropped mana as well. I gained 3 levels from this fight.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjEyZDMwMjlkNzRlMDM5ODEzOGRjNTY4ZmU1ZDcx" data-original-margin="">The third and fourth groups were fairly similar to the first. All of them were between level 155 and 165. Good mana, but no more levels.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTU3MzI5ODljMjRlZDdiYzYzMDQ0NWY1NzQ1M2Zm" data-original-margin="">After these two fights I got a bit antsy and decided to venture a bit deeper into the dungeon again. Apparently the further I traveled in the stronger the monsters are. I guess it makes sense.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDlkNmRkY2MxOTQ2MGE5YmVjMmEwY2FkOGQ5OGVj" data-original-margin="">My fifth fight was with two strong Minotaurs. They were level 177 and 179. I had to use my bobbing and weaving tactics to the extreme. My body hardening worked well enough, but hits still hurt and dealt a tiny bit of damage. All in all, it was a manageable fight. I gained 2 levels and collected only mana as loot.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTllNDlhYmU0MDRlZjJhOTExMGM5MDQ1MGJlYzg5" data-original-margin="">After this fight I was getting a bit tired and hungry. It was time to pack it in. I trekked back to the dungeon start point and faced off against a final group of 3 that weren't much of a challenge.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2NhYmNjYzRmNjQ3MjY5NDY1N2NiNWM4YjZiZDM4" data-original-margin="">They were between level 155 and 165. All three dropped large mana stones, and one of them dropped their axe as well. I didn't level up in this battle, but couldn't have asked for a better parting gift.</p>
<p class="cnM4ODkzOWFiYjljMjQ4MGU4NGIyN2NmNTY3ZDdkMmVl" data-original-margin="">As I stepped out of the blue portal back into the Dungeon Hub transit area I smirked to myself.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTZjNzNlZmM2YjQ1ZDI5YTMwMDAzZjI2NGQ2NDc3" data-original-margin="">That was a good first day of grinding to get my feet wet. I'm level 172 now, tomorrow I'll venture much deeper into this Minotaur Dungeon.</p>
