# Chapter 61 - Advertisment

The torrential rain soaked the earth of the Culdao Peaks, the soil and roots turning into sludge as birds and animals alike took shelter. Some relished in the water, but soon, a thunderous cacophony of pitter-patter could be heard off in the distance, a solemn drum beating in rhythm with the tired gasp of goblin soldiers.

< That accursed Gulak, forcing me to come out to this backwater area! > A small but well-shaven goblin envoy with smooth emerald-like skin and a lavish attire grumbled on his palanquin. The burdensome weight was hoisted high by four goblins who struggled under the weight of the ornate design and other ‘necessities’ the envoy had deemed essential for the trip.

The front and back of the procession were guarded by a dozen goblin soldiers each, while twenty servant goblins lugged large empty woven baskets on their sweaty backs, their contents empty in preparation for the tribute.

A strong gust of wind buffeted the troops, the rain crashing into the envoy sideways and wetting its chair and silk-like garments, causing his face to scrounge up in sheer irritation. < Are we within a hundred steps yet?! >

< Yes, sire! > A servant goblin responded.

< Halt! > The envoy held up its right hand, the procession stopping. < Send forth the messengers. Have Gulak prostrate before me! >

Three goblin soldiers acting as messengers moved forward, armed to the teeth with iron spear and a sword, while the envoy waited with anticipation. *That damn Gulak! If only he had just provided tribute on time, I wouldn’t have to come out all the way here! Let’s see his face when I raise the tribute requirements!* A wide grin appeared on the envoy’s face, its sharp front teeth bared for all to see, hardly concealing its excitement.

The envoy raised yet another hand, beckoning one of the veteran hobgoblins under his command to approach the palanquin. < Have the soldiers prepare for a raid! > The hobgoblin stood tall, nearly human height, yet he bowed to the diminutive envoy in obedience.

< Sire, are we not here to collect tribute from a loyal goblin tribe?! >

< Loyal? They have missed the final deadline for tribute offering to Sahusa, our great King! This is unacceptable and an affront to the unity of the goblin kingdom. Do you understand? >

< … yes, sire. > The veteran hobgoblin did not fancy going to war with their own tributary but complied with the order anyway.

Noticing the hesitation apparent on the veteran’s face, the envoy sighed. < If we do not teach a lesson now, then how will the kingdom survive when every damn tribe delays their tribute! Our economy is already on the brink – if we do not collect the tribute, rationing will have to begin soon. >

< Understood, sire. >

However, before the veteran could make a move, a howl of pain could be heard in the distance, from the direction of the goblin den. The envoy squinted its eyes, only to see a ragged and bleeding messenger running back to them. Arrow shafts stuck out of its skin like a pin cushion, making the others wonder how the messenger was still even able to run.

< Who's attacking us? > The envoy called out.

The messenger barely seemed to have registered the envoy’s call to stop, instead running right past the procession with all haste, screaming its lungs out with abandon. A wave of fear struck the soldiers of the procession as they watched the injured messenger disappear into the forest behind them, making them wonder what kind of danger the messenger encountered.

< What’s going on?! How dare they fight back? > The envoy was enraged – the arrows in the messengers were clearly of goblin-make, which meant Gulak had attacked his messengers. < Prepare for subjugation of this infidels! >

It was then that the source of the messenger’s fear appeared in front of them, a lone human woman bearing an ornate crossbow in one hand and the corpse of a goblin messenger in the other, its heart clearly ripped out by the woman's bloodied hands.

< Human?! What is a human doing here? >

< She tortured him! The tribe of Gulak has already fallen to the humans! >

< It’s a trap! >

A wave of panic spread through the soldiers as they saw their comrade’s corpse, some of the more timid servants immediately throwing their baskets to the ground and fleeing the procession.

< Stand your grounds, you fools! What can a human do to the great kingdom of Sahusa? We've beaten them back before and we'll do it again! > The envoy rallied the troops, but it was to no avail. With each step the human woman took towards them, the shivering and the fright spread even more through the two dozen goblin soldiers who each now faced an internal turmoil on whether to fight or retreat.

The veteran hobgoblin stood steadfast, taking up point with a spear and shield. His presence did nothing more than to hold the soldiers together precariously. But before he could even give an order, a single goblin arrow shot right through the gap between his helmet and his chest armour, embedding itself in the windpipe.

That was all it took to have the goblins to scream and scatter completely, the fear infectious as they fled in all directions. The palanquin was thrown unceremoniously to the floor, with the four servant goblins unwilling to sacrifice their lives for their envoy.

< Come back this instant, or you shall be executed for desertion! > The envoy shrieked at the top of his lungs, but the threat of the law did not pose any burden for the retreating goblins, leaving the envoy to face down the human woman alone.

The goblin arrow had not been shot by her, but by attacking goblin archers posted in the trees as scouts. The envoy gasp at the sight of the goblins acting like elves, a natural disgust rising up in his throat. < You… have all of you been corrupted? How dare you scurry around like rats on trees? >

< Better to be on a tree than a rat struggling in the mud like you. >

The envoy squinted once more, spotting Gulak behind the human woman with a wide grin. < Gulak! You! How dare you collude with humans! >

< Life is much better here than ever before, Erasg! As our guest of honour, you should come and visit to see for yourself! >

The implications was clear to the envoy, who quickly scrambled for a weapon. Grabbing a dropped-sword nearby, it quickly aimed it at its own heart and was about to thrust deep before the human woman lunged forward, kicking the sword away.

With a strong grip, the human woman grasped the goblin by the neck, lifting up high. The eerie slience of the human woman worried the envoy even more than Gulak’s cackling. *By the ancestors, may King Sahusa and the Oracle protect our kingdom…*

“Here we are at the South Sector, who we-uh…. At one of the…” A homely girl stuttered while staring blankly at a lightcapturer with a confused expression, scrounged up in desperation as she tried to remember her lines.

“Okay, okay, cut!” Reese waved his hands frantically, stopping the recording. A few sighs left the crew on site, sweltering under the intense heat as they hoisted lighting equipment and supplies for the filming. Yet none of them dared to utter a word to the obviously flustered girl, her bumbling stutter somehow a point of endearment that washed away their anger. Her intricate dress and tight-fitting skirt only increased their threshold of annoyance, her beauty a sight for sore eyes despite her various mistakes.

“Okay, Emily, breathe, focus. Breathe, alright? ” Reese calmly spoke to the flustered girl.

“Sorry, Mr. Reese, I forgot my lines; it’s my first time doing this!” Emily apologized furiously, bowing so low her dainty hat nearly fell to the floor.

“No, no, no, it’s okay. It’s all of our first time, don’t worry about a mistake or two! Let’s try again, and if you need to go slow, just go slowly, alright?”

Emily nodded, quickly resuming back into position, her opulent layered skirt elegantly trailing on the smooth stone tiles of the arcade’s outer plaza. The surrounding onlookers dressed in all sorts of clothes, Versian migrants and Raktor citizens alike, watched with hushed tones, mesmerized by the silhouette of the stunning beauty. If Reese had told them that she used to be a worker at the Lusty Arcian under the care of Slavin, not a single soul would believe him.

Except Kyle, of course.

“3,2,1 and GO!”

"Here we are at the South Sector, at one of the hottest spots of the year - the Golden Snakes Shopping Arcade! I am your presenter for this show - Emily Bourton, and we'll be giving you a tour of the area and showing you exactly how much progress has been accomplished here!" She stepped out of the way to reveal a stunning shot of the Golden Snakes shopping arcade, complete with an expansive foyer and square where hundreds of locals were gathered, soaking in the sun and enjoying themselves. Most of them stared in confusion at the newfangled light-capturer, while some of the more cheeky children waved their grimy hands at Emily, who smiled back.

"For this grand tour, I'll be accompanied by Inquisitor Mason! Inquisitor Mason, please introduce yourself to our lovely audience!" 

"Hi... uhm.... I.... I.... what was I supposed to say again?"

"CUT, CUT, CUT!" Reese hollered, slapping his own chair in a sudden outburst far different from how Emily was treated.

A collective groan erupted from the crew, their attitude vastly more aggressive in nature. A few onlookers sniggered and jeered at the obviously photo-shy Mason, who glared back at them while tapping his embellished inquisitor cap as a reminder of what he could do to them. That stifled the crowd in an instant.

Reese, on the other hand, was on the verge of pulling out his already thinning hair, the level of frustration impeccable. "This... AHHHHH! What the hell is wrong with you?! How can a man like you fuck up on this level?"

Mason gritted his teeth, his chest rising in anger. "Hey, what the hell? This is my first mistake! How come Emily can fuck up twenty times but-"

"See?! I need that, I need that confidence WHEN we're running the lightcapturer, NOT after! You know what? I don't give a shit if you're an inquisitor or not, and I'm going to treat you like a dumb kid. Even my daughter can perform better than you! Hey, YOU! Yea, you! Find some large presenation paper and write his lines big. Real big. Yea, NOW! Get them off the printing presses nearby, I don't care!"

Mason was about to protest about the apparent disparity in treatment when suddenly someone patted him on the arm, nearly prompting him to attack on instinct.

“Don’t worry, Mister Mason! You got this! Let’s do it!” Emily gave a cheerful smile along with a cute little thumbs-up, the indignant rage within Mason melting away like frozen water on a comet.

"Uhh, yes... of course of course." Mason muttered non-committingly, adjusting his sleeves and collar properly. 

Reese held back on the rest of his rant, his own anger mellowed out by the cuteness radiated by Emily. The annoyed crew were also appeased, their spirits somehow uplifted by the homely girl who was a sheer bundle of endless energy.

Soon, one of the crew returned with a big signboard freshly printed. "Now, you have no excuse to forget your lines. Your lines are right here. Before the rest of the crew comes back, I want you to practice so you stop wasting your time and my time, got it? Try it now!"  Reese grunted.

The signboard was placed them near the lightcapturer like a cue card, with Mason muttering the lines to himself over and over again, his hands clearly fidgeting from the stage fright.

"Good!" Reese clapped his hands, signaling yet another re-run as Emily and the crew returned. "Last chance otherwise I'm going to tell Bishop Vernette!”

“Why do you make it sound like she’s my mom?! I’m forty years old, for Yual’s sake!”

“Then you better act your damn age, or else I'll get my daughter to replace you. ACTION!"

Mason instantly straightened his back, dusting off his sliver pauldrons and fluttering his inquisitor coat. "Hi everyone, I'm Mason, and thanks for having me on. It's my pleasure to show off what the enforcers have aimed for and achieved here."

"Awesome! Let's get started!" Emily put on a cheerful smile, instantly carrying the fliming with sheer confidence. "But, Inquisitor Mason, before we begin, I noticed that there's something strange here. Something feels off!"

"Indeed, maybe a few intellectuals in the audience might be able to tell. It has something to do with the streets; look how many people there are and its condition."

"Wow, you're right! They are spotless, immaculately so! And there's not a homeless person in sight - how is this possible?"

"That's the secret to the success story of the districts so far - the enforcers of the Sanctum of Yual have been hard at work, collaborating with the Golden Snakes Construction Company to provide free housing for everyone in the area, ensuring a stable living environment for all."

"Free housing? That sounds too good to be true!"

"Of course, because there are a few simple conditions one would need to achieve before being able to enjoy this new housing project. Contrary to first impressions, the housing built is owned by the Golden Snakes Construction Company, which has placed a requirement for all residents to hold a job in this district."

"Holding a job here? But that's hard in today's economy, and some might even say that there are no jobs at all!"

"Naturally, if we place such a requirement, we also have provided the means with which to fulfill that benchmark." Mason was getting into the groove now, speaking far more naturally than before. "The Golden Snakes Construction Company provides more than ample jobs, with more than a thousand openings available on a daily and monthly basis. Not only that, other companies in the district are ramping up their operations, and manpower is in short supply."

"Great news for people looking for employment and a brighter future ahead!" Emily nodded, her joyful expression instilling confidence in Mason.

"As for their families, the housing provided is large enough to accommodate a family of five, as long as one works according to his ability."

"Brilliant, they can bring all their loved ones over as well! But are there enough amenities around here?"

"Of course, there are! Let's take a tour of the Golden Snakes Shopping Arcade now!"

"And CUT! Well done! Move to the next set, quick!" Reese ordered the crew, hurriedly scrambling with the equipment in tow into the shopping arcade, where the temperature control delivered the perfect climate, cooling all of them down.

The shopping arcade was a bustle of activity, with the crowd of onlookers naturally jostling into the corridors and blocking paths. A few scuffles broke out between angry customers and irritated shop-owners. “HEY! NO WAITING OUTSIDE THE SHOP! YOU’RE BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE!”

Many of them shifted, but still fought for a place to get a glimpse of the beautiful Emily who seemed to have a certain charm of sorts, one that Reese planned to utilize to its best effect.

As the crew set up again in the expansive corridor along the shops, Reese fiddled with the lightcapturer, peering through the scope and checking the angles. He tried lugging it around, hauling it on his shoulder, struggling to move with its sheer weight. *I should design a mobile version.*

He glanced around, peering through the numerous onlookers and trying to find a solution. He suddenly noticed Damian munching on a seasoned boiled potato in a nearby tuckshop without a care in the world, unbothered by the commotion all around him. "Damian! Damian!" Reese waved frantically, jumping up and down.

"Huh?" Damian stared blankly around in confusion until Reese shoved his way through the crowd to grab him. “I’m off duty now. Get Niko if you need security.”

"Get over here! Quickly! I need your help!"

"What, why? What's wrong?" Damian hurriedly stuffed the remainder of his potato into his mouth, rushing over, thinking that Reese was in some trouble.

Instead, the lightcapturer was placed onto his broad shoulders, with two crew members struggling to tighten a harness across his thick burly chest. "Damian, I need you to walk slowly with them and keep the lightcapturer stable. Hold it tightly, don’t slouch and remain steady as much as possible. Got it?"

“But I was just about to eat one more pota-“

A glare from Reese imparted the importance of the event onto Damian, who quickly nodded with a slight hint of confusion until he noticed Mason and Emily preparing up in front of him, ready for the next segment. "Okay, okay, I’ll do it!”

"Alright, lighting on!" A few handheld arctech spotlights blasted the two of them, the glare visible in their pupils along with the crew shoving a few persistent bystanders aside out of the view."3,2,1 and GO!"

"So we're inside the Golden Snakes Shopping Arcade now, what do you think?" Mason started off, reading off the cue card intently with sheer concentration.

"I think it's brilliant, and amazing. One of the better places to be in the South Sector for sure!" Emily happily skipped over to the nearby tuckshop, motioning at the queue of people lining up for their meal, most of which instantly turned around and hid, many still believing in the more esoteric properties of the light-capturer, albeit with a tinge of shyness and embarrassment.

"There's a proper weather-conditioned area to eat in peace and comfort, and if you got a bad stomach or something getting you down? Right opposite here is a certified Alchemist Guild store - but it's not your average one: it's a cheaper version! It's not as effective as a proper potion, yet it still gets the job done."

"And sometimes that is all one needs. Rest, entertainment, and relaxation are what really heal you. Everything you need is right here at the shopping arcade - you have clothiers, florists, toymakers, and cafes. Up above, we have the light-thrower theatre, one of the best entertainments in town today. All of these can be done safely without the fear of pickpockets and criminals."

"Why is that, Inquisitor Mason?"

"We have enforcers posted in the area 24/7, and of course, with the help of the Golden Snakes Construction Company, we are able to monitor and ensure the dignity and safety of everyone in this region alone. The enforcers are looking at expanding these operations, but it will be some time until the end of our test run. I believe this shows the critical importance of the Sanctum of Yual in delivering a better future for all citizens and that we are committed to making life better in Raktor."

The recording continued on, with Damian tirelessly following the two around, with a few attempts to eat on the job. The rest of the shopping arcade was shown in detailed sequence before proceeding to the new housing units, ten-story high buildings with multiple apartments per floor, an oddity amdist the more decrepit shacks just in the other district.

"And for those thinking that it is your average boarding house, with the usual chilling winds coming in through the pockmarked roof, think again!" Emily grinned for the light-capturer as she opened a door to a showroom, where the apartment was neatly furnished with the basics, the walls painted with a nice clean white finish, the furniture simple but efficient. "One apartment can host you and your family quite comfortably. Much better than being out on the streets!"

"Yes, and what's more, the Golden Snakes Construction Company has pledged to expand housing by another five blocks in this district alone, accounting for almost six thousand apartments. It would be the biggest housing project in the South Sector alone!"

"That's incredible! But Inquisitor Mason, with only a thousand jobs available in with the Golden Snakes Construction Company, how can the apartments be filled up?"

"I'm sure many have heard the news of a new weapons factory opening up in this district, co-owned by both Baron Cain and the Golden Snakes Construction Company. This and other affiliate companies are also eligible for the free housing as long as they hold a job in this area. And for those who think they do not possess the qualifications, listen up close: a trade school is about to open in a few months."

Emily gasped with an obviously fake astonished expression before turning to the lightcapturer with a photogenic smile. "That's right, all; this district is about to become the new shining star of the South Sector - what are all of you waiting for? Apply today!"

"And perfect - DONE! Good job, everyone, that's all for today." Reese hollered.

“Thank you all! Thank you, Mister Mason and Mr. Reese!” Emily bowed with humility multiple times, earning the hearts of the crew as they cheered and applauded.

Mason adjusted his collars and sleeves, nodding at Emily’s appreciation as he clapped along. The applause and cheering went on for a while longer, while Reese reviewed the captured footage on a lightthrower, projecting it onto a nearby wall to see if they needed any additional shots.

“Looks like we’re good. Tomorrow, we’ll be doing the weapons factory and the other buildings.” Reese announced.

The announcement caught Mason off-guard. “Wait a minute, I don’t remember signing up for multiple runs! This was supposed to be a one-time thing!” He objected.

“If it was a one-time thing, why did you fuck it up so many times?!”

“I only fucked it up ONCE! I never - Either way, I won’t be available. I have districts to patrol!” Mason was about to turn around and walk off until he caught a glimpse of a shiny gold emblem, Reese fiddling with it in his hand. “You… how… you’re not allowed to hold onto that!”

“Oh, but I am! Under the power vested to me temporarily by the Bishop of the South Sector, Inquisitor Mason is hereby ordered to assist the Golden Snakes Construction Company until the completion of the advertisement. Also, Kyle and Bishop Vernette will be present tomorrow, so you better memorize your lines if you don’t want to look like an idiot!”
# Chapter 62 - Plans for Expansion

“The new girl seems to be doing quite well. Where did you find her? Central Sector?” Bishop Vernette asked as she overlooked a roaring construction site, the thrum and whirs of heavy arctech machinery nearly drowning out her soft gentle voice.

Dozens of workers swarmed the area, their actions seemingly choreographed to a hidden beat presented all across the site. Fine dust particles hung in the air, kicked up by the never-ending movement of steel beams, bricks and clay, hauled to and fro along a temporary scaffolding that enveloped the entire old factory, which had been completely cordoned off by a series of barriers, guarded by a few Seven Snakes to ensure no one stole any materials.

The bishop squinted her eyes, peering not too far away where a whole host of activity was happening: the lightcapturer filiming, for which Inquisitor Mason was being berated once more.

“Bishop, the potential for greatness lies in everyone, not just those of the Central Sector. A boost in confidence is all the difference one needs to reach the sky. Even diamonds can be found in the rough here.” Kyle replied, leaving out the part of Emily being a former sex worker under Slavin at the Lusty Arcian.

“If someone else other than a gang leader said that, I might be inclined to believe it.” The bishop smiled. “People don’t change much. I’ve learned that much over my career.”

“Then you just haven’t gone far enough.”

“And do you have the means to go that far?”

“With Baron Cain’s blessing, I do. With the Ardent Cretins… not so much.”

“If this is an implicit cry for help, I can’t do anything on my end. You’re not the only one with a peace treaty.”

“I know.” Kyle took a deep breath, looking across the construction site, the din echoing off the walls of other nearby warehouses and manufacturing plants. The old factory in which Niko, Karl and Gordon used to work was being overhauled to be the site of the new weapons factory, with many of the existing infrastructure reutilized and diverted for efficiency and speed. It was far easier to retrofit the old factory than to build one from scratch, saving much time.

Kyle had obtained the land deed through a ‘conversation’ with the owner, the transfer officiated by Baron Cain himself thanks to the joint venture. With all the odds against the owner, he wouldn’t be surprised if the owner and his family were halfway to Versia or Kregol now.

“Well, looks like it’s my turn.” Bishop Vernette was a bit excited to be featured in the advertisement, carefully stepping down a sandy slope while Kyle escorted her, reaching the lightcapturer crew where Reese was.

“How’s everything?” Kyle inspected the crew and arctech engravings, checking for any errant accumulation of dust that might affect the lightcapturer.

“Looking good. We should be done in three days.”

“Good. We have all the necessary equipment in place?”

“Yes, sir, I have five dozen degraded light-throwers that we can distribute across the South Sector as a gift to spread our marketing efforts.”

“Excellent. Have them sent to the local pubs and soup kitchens. I want the advertisements playing the moment it is ready. We need to attract talent as quickly as possible. Keep up the good work.” Kyle patted Reese on the shoulder before leaving to inspect the weapons factory.

Close to two hundred construction workers were on hand, digging and layering bricks en-masse, the multiple floors being knocked down to create one singular expansive room. Kyle strode past diggers, machinery operators, and managers, earning a respectful bow or a salute from everyone around.

None of the old factory was left behind, though the workers were still retained, many of them now temporarily working under the Golden Snakes. Theoretically, nearly everything was in place for the operation of the weapons factory. Yet Kyle faced a pertinent problem, one that he had yet to solve.

He made his way through the site towards a makeshift office, where Gordon was planning the placement of the heavy machinery with the other construction managers. “Twenty rows, with a continuous conveyor belt system moving downwards. Each individual worker takes care of one specific procedure, with no one other than the designers learning more than three procedures. Each station should have an arctech etcher performing a singular task as well as spotlights for a better view. On top of that, metal grill catwalks all around the perimeter as a security feature. We don’t want any sabotages, unionization or funky business.”

The moment Gordon noticed Kyle entering the tent, he instantly bowed, as did the rest of the managers. Kyle merely waved them off, focusing on the issue at hand. “What’s our current situation?”

“The external structural design and floor plan is somewhat complete, what’s left is the allocation of space. If we were to follow the old factory’s design, each team will be assigned a single row.”

“And the team comprises of?”

“Two arctech designers, two logistics and twelve technicians.”

“For a single production line? That’s not enough, let me see the floor plan.” Kyle ran his fingers over the drawn-out blueprint, measuring the available distance. The team was pitfully small for the area available, as well as the scale that Kyle was intending to hit. “We can do much more than that.”

“Yes, but organizationally, it would be harder to control.”

“No, it’s doable. We’ll have twenty production teams, five supply teams, three design teams and one management team.”

The managers looked around at each other in confusion, with Gordon also scratching his head. “You’re suggesting to split up the current working unit?”

“There’s no reason for designers and logistics to be tied to a single team. They should be floating. The supply team will keep track of the number of parts and raw resources required by each production team, fulfilling each order in sequence and by priority. Also, the production teams’ number of technicians should be increased to a hundred.”

“A hundred?! We can’t fit a hundred.”

“We can’t, but this way, we will be able to do shifts around the clock. The production lines must keep going even through the night. Designers will be allocated the smallest space here, supply teams near the loading bay. Each team should have about thirty-three workers per eight-hour shift, until we can procure the requisite heavy machinery to lower our headcount. Understood?”

Kyle would have gone further if he could – if he had the option he would have robots replace every single human worker, with all protocols under his direct control. But he had fallen a long way from his Galactic Era position, and with so many willing employees lingering out in the streets, it was only right that he made use of them.

Gordon felt a bit resistant to the idea overall, having no prior experience of running such a large operation, yet he could not reject it. “Yes, sir.”

“Good. How’s our progress on finding the employees?”

“Well, we weren’t expecting to hire as many as a hundred per team. We can try, but I highly doubt we’re going to be able to fill up the vacancies in time for the opening ceremony. If we want more experienced people, we could try discussing with the various masters.”

"Masters?"

"Masters of the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths. They are compromised of skilled craftsman who has been making weapons for generations. Though, discussions with them may be a bit tricky..."

Kyle got a rough idea of why. "We obtained the license through a direct grant by the Baron instead of going through them. Since we've ran afoul of their 'procedures' we can expect some trouble. No matter, I will handle it. What about the arctech designers? Don't tell me they are part of the same society as well."

“About that… we only have ten designers currently, if you include Reese and Gordon. We have a few more signing up, but they are not exactly the best nor the cream of the crop since we're explictly trying to avoid those who are in the society. It would take time to get them up to speed.”

“That’s not enough. We need at least fifty overall to be able to run the production lines smoothly. Where is Keith?”

“He’s in the adjacent building, setting up the trade school as you've requested.”

The trade school was a reconditioned apartment building but converted for the purposes of educating future factory workers. Kyle needed a continuous stream of skilled labour to achieve the economic goals that he had set forth, and the trade school served its purpose well both in the short-term and long-term

However, they did not have any teachers hired yet, despite having already invested the money into the establishment. Construction workers were already building up technical studios, practical workshops and classrooms while Keith was busy talking through an arctech radio in the newly furnished principal’s office, though it now only sported a simple table and chair filled to the brim with papers. Each paper held the information on every skilled arctech designer in the districts.

“…Then I wish you the best of luck in your future career. Take care. Thank you.” Keith hung up on the radio call, letting out a frustrated sigh as Kyle entered the office. “Sir, we have a problem regarding the recruitment of the arctech designers.”

“I noticed. How many so far?”

“I’ve called fifty, only a few responded. The rest turned me down, or didn’t pick up the radio.”

“Are we not offering double the current market rate? No one else here offers that much. They should be approaching us in swaths, bar those who have aligned themselves with the society.”

“The fifty we've approached are not part of the society. And yes, we are offering double… but take a look at this.” Keith handed him a scrounged-up flyer. “It’s been spreading through the city like wildfire recently.”

The flyer had an interesting style to it: thick accented watercolours seemingly mass printed by multiple printing presses, with a smart-looking handsome man plastered all over it. The face didn’t really matter to Kyle, only the number that was printed below the headline of the flyer.

“20000 rakels a month is ridiculous. No one would pay that amount in Raktor.” Kyle remarked, flipping over the flyer to see the other side.

“Exactly. I don’t know how they’ve done it, but right now, Harrison Industries is all the rage. People are smuggling themselves into Versia despite the restrictions just for a chance to work under him.”

Kyle knew Harrison, though he never met him in person. The Versian had bet a large amount of money during his auction of the Oriental Bloom, nearly taking it out of Baron Cain’s hands. Furthermore, Reese was nearly kidnapped by Harrison as soon as he completed the light-thrower. It was immediately obvious what was happening here.

“It’s a race for human resources. And skilled arctech designers will be the make or break for the upcoming war, Harrison was just ahead of us in the game.” Kyle concluded, not putting much thought into Harrison's actions, knowing that there was always solutions.

“The Ardent Cretins are also highly protective of their designers as well. I can’t get any information on them, it’s like they have been erased from the world. Their names have been blacked out on this copy. I suspect if I tried to dig up any information on them, we would run into much more trouble.” Keith tapped on a book detailing all recent graduates from the University of Raktor’s arctech design program.

“Let's not poke the Ardent Cretins anymore. ” As indignant as Kyle was about the still persistent blockade, he saw it as an opportunity to develop his own parallel economy rather than be dependent on businesses under the control of Sebastian. This way he would be free of the effects of anything more that the Ardent Cretins tried to do. “How many left?”

“Based on this book, three thousand. But they are scattered all across the city. If you’re talking just about the South Sector, then there’s only five hundred left available, not including the fifty I’ve called.”

Kyle paced around the room, thinking carefully. With a diminishing pool of skilled manpower, he would not be able to delegate designing duties to the factory. Reese and Gordon were just two people, hardly enough to handle the entire Seven Snakes catalogue of requirements.

“Raise our starting salary to 25000 rakels. Run the numbers, how long can we last?”

Keith baulked instantly, but quickly calculated on a piece of paper, twirling a pen in his hands. “We’re still under embargo by the Ardent Cretins, which means iron and coal are all priced exorbitantly.”

“Didn’t we get ninety million rakels from the information dealer? If I’m not wrong we should still have thirty million rakels left.” Kyle had a good grasp on the finances.

“Yes, you’re right. Sixty million rakes were allocated it all for the six housing blocks as well as the weapons factory and this trade school. We’re only left with thirty million rakels or so for operational usage. 25000 rakels with fifty designers means…” Keith scribbled down quickly, mentally adding up the expenses. “We’ll run out in a year or so, assuming we don’t expand any further. And I haven’t included the wages for the technicians and other miscellaneous staff, not to mention the cost of buying iron and coal.”

*Fifteen million a year just for the fifty designers…* Kyle, of course, was planning to expand further. Yet it was impossible to compromise on workers – skilled labour was necessary. “If we can’t compromise on salary, then we have to compromise elsewhere… how much more are we paying for the iron and coal now?”

“About close to 400% from last year. Lowest I’ve been offered was 250%, but that was from the Tul'e Da'li , the East Sector’s major gang, who apparently is on close terms with their Baron. If we accept their supply, the Ardent Cretins could take it as an direct offense and try to clamp down harder on us physically via hijackings and raids. They are not on the best terms with the Tul’e Da’li…”

“Even 250% is a rip-off. We’ll need to find an alternative source of iron and coal if we want to support the salary of the designers, and soon. Otherwise, the weapons factory will be running dry in months if Harrison raises his offering again.” Kyle rejected the offer. When he proposed the weapons factory, he had been banking on assumptions made following certain well-known hallmarks of historical progression based on his former Galactic Era education. He had already priced in double the current salary, not expecting Harrison to quadruple it.

Furthermore, Kyle’s weapons factory was not the only one clamoring for resources. With the war all but confirmed in name, Count Leon had his own gaggle of businessmen who supported his every move, forming a corrupt conglomerate with the best locations and adjacencies to iron mine deposits and coking coal for steel manufacturing. This was the real reason why the prices in the market were so high this time round.

“There is an independent iron mine deposit in Kregol that we could potentially discuss with.” Keith pointed out. “Though I hear it is under the control of their own native gangs as well. The Ravens, if I recall correctly.”

Kyle massaged his temples, trying to think his way out of this predicament. “If we go with them, we will need to pay them an additional fee to get them to supply us with the necessary materials. Furthermore, the transportation would take more than four hours one way via wagon, and is prone to being hijacked.”

The radio on Keith’s desk beeped, Adrian’s voice crackling through the static on the private Seven Snakes vipers’ channel. [Keith, is Boss with you?]

“Yeah, go ahead.”

[Just got word from the Culdao Peaks that Sasha captured a goblin official, who seems to be a representative from the goblin kingdom deeper in. The official tried to claim tribute from our first goblin den with a few soldiers…]

A sudden flash of inspiration struck Kyle. “What weapons did they have? Armour?”

[From what I understand, they have iron spears and shields…]

“Homemade? Or stolen?”

[I’ll need to verify with them, but as far as I can tell, it was all homemade.]

Kyle instantly sprung to action, speaking quickly into the radio. “Adrian, tell Sasha to prepare from my arrival. Keith, raise the salary cap, but find me a prospector first, the best one you can find. He will be following me to the Culdao Peaks. How far has the tunnel been dug?”

Keith was caught unaware, confusedly looking at Kyle. “The tunnel should be about half of the way to here, sir, perhaps it would be complete in two months. But what about the weapons factory? Why are you going there now?”

“Focus on hiring: you, Gordon, and Reese will be in charge of setting everything up. The goblins’ weapons are indicative that they have their own form of iron production, however small. As such, instead of buying iron and coal externally, we will develop our own vertical economy.”

“That means we would have to refine and process the iron ourselves into steel before making the weapons. How are we going to get the manpower and resources necessary to do all the additional work?” The confused Keith racked his brain. “We would need to transport workers from Raktor to Culdao Peaks… and then have a food supply and housing for them…?”

Kyle could only sigh. “Keith, it seems like you’re still not ready to be a gang leader. We already have a workforce in the Culdao Peaks. All we have to do is expand.”
# Chapter 63 - Prospecting

[< Ahhhh, save me! Anyone, help me! >] A female goblin wailed in its own language as it cowered on the ground, virulent brilliant flames erupting all around here as the blackened trees burnt down, crashing in a cacophony of destruction. The sounds of fighting and fellow goblin tribe members’ screams of pain echoed all around her, causing her to tremble slightly, clutching and protecting a goblin baby with her life.

The gallop of a horse could be heard in the distance, a steel glint betraying it’s riders armour, the distinctive yellow grin of a goblin soldier appearing in her vision while the tip of a spear pointed right at her and her baby.

[< Have mercy, please! I did not rebel! >] The female goblin pleaded on all fours, clutching onto her only descendant. [< At least let this child of mine go free! >]

[< You think I am a fool?! If I let your child go, who knows if he will also become a rebel? I shall nip this in the bud right now! >]

[< NOOOOO! >]

Just as the rider was about to stab forward, the baby’s eyes suddenly flew wide open, glowing bright yellow with demonic flames spurting out from its pupils, an immense pressure suddenly falling upon the rider.

A strong defensive golden barrier suddenly appeared around the mother, deflecting the spear and knocking the rider off balance. The startled horse jerked backwards, letting out a neigh before galloping off in fear, leaving the rider to his fate.

[< Wha-what is this baby? How can it be so strong? Impossible? Unless… >] The rider wore a face of pure, exaggerated horror, its mouth agape as it watched the yellow aura swirling around the baby goblin surge to an even greater height that towered over the flames around them.

The baby goblin began to rapidly grow up, turning into a full-size hobgoblin in three seconds, cracking its knuckles and walking menacingly towards the rider, each step causing the ground to violently shudder with the force of an eruption.

[< You’ll… you’ll never take me alive! >] The rider screamed at the top of his lungs, pulling out a backup knife and jabbing it right at the yellow aura hobgoblin. The knife barely penetrated more than a millimeter into the yellow aura, the storm knocking the knife away as it twirled into the sky with a twinkle.

[< Fool! My power is over 9000! >] The hobgoblin flicked the tip of its nose as it got into a fighting posture. [< BEHOLD! THE STEEL SONG TRIBE’S FIFTIETH SECRET ART – CONSECUTIVE NORMAL PUNCHES 1000! >]

The enormous hobgoblin roared as he threw a flurry of punches, smacking the rider into an unrecognizable pulp in just five seconds before finishing the combo with a kick that sent the rider flying into the sky. Just as the hobgoblin did a victory pose, it began to shrink again back to a baby form, ooo-ing and gaga-ing at the mother.

The female goblin gasped, scampering over to the baby hobgoblin. [< Oh my dear baby! How did you get so strong in just a month?! >].

The baby hobgoblin couldn’t reply, but it looked in the direction of the audience and winked, ending the scene.

[< Coming to the theatre this Marth 21st: That Time I Went Forward in Time To Be My Great-Granddaughter’s Baby while Retaining All of My Powerups and Skills as well as My Intellect and My Ladykiller Moves and Your Mum. Yes, Your Mum. >]

The lights in the underground theatre began to turn back on as the screen showing the film dimmed, with the goblin audience practically screaming and cheering for the trailer.

< NUMBAS GO UP! He hit 9000! >

< This is the best film by far! >

< Everything is better than the stupid Enforcer Man – who wants to watch a show about stupid humans?! >

< Indeed, we finally get a rendition of our own folklore! >

< I must say, it is not actually accurate. In the original tale of King Sahusa the Great, it was said that he actually reincarnated through every single generation, so he actively found the best female goblins to lay, honing his craft over multiple generations. In fact, is he not the current king of the Steel Song tribe? >

< Exactly! And I recall my mother telling me that he had five arms and four legs! This film is trash! Not even historically accurate! I have cave drawings to prove it! >

Only a single goblin was furious at the film, the said envoy who had been captured by Sasha. < What is this nonsense! How dare they drag the goblins’ culture through the mud like this? Appaling! >

However, none of the other goblins gave a shit, completely ignoring him and infuriating him even more. Before he could shout anymore, a female human hand grabbed him from behind, dragging him back to his prison cell. < Wait, no please, I was wrong! It’s great! I love how the baby's shield glitter- WAIT! > He pleaded, yet the lady did not make a single sound as only his begging could be heard disappearing into the tunnels.

As the audience bickered and discussed the trailer, two other humans near the back of the theatre were silently watching the audience reaction, with a girl holding a clipboard and jotting down details, intently observing their emotions. “Hey, you! Make sure they pay for the trailer! One rakel for each member, even kids. I don’t care if they are one month old or not! If they can breathe - they can pay!” The girl screamed at a goblin worker, who nodded quickly.

She continued writing down on the clipboard. “Reaction: S+, Controversy: S+. This film will surely be one of the best we’ve made for the goblins. Perfect distraction to keep them working.”

The man standing next to her cleared his throat. “Uh… Merissa, I don’t understand why-“

“It’s Ms. Merissa to you, Feldon.”

“Ms. Merissa, why are we making films for the goblins? Shouldn’t we be making films for Raktor?”

“We already are, but the goblins need to be appeased for a few moments to make our position here better secured. We need to present ourselves as a clear force for good, or else they would continuously try to rebel. This is just a simple method to calm down tensions.”

“Did they not try to rebel just a week ago?”

“Only the newer slaves. The better of a class system we build, the easier it is for us to have them turn on each other while we hold the reigns overall.” Merissa tapped her clipboard. “Have you not learnt anything over the past few months you’ve been here, Feldon? How the hell were you hired as a company manager of all positions?”

“Uh… I looked good?”

Merissa wanted to retort, but she couldn’t disagree. Despite for all of Feldon’s failings, he did have a intriguing charm. In fact, Merissa wouldn’t mind if Feldon’s wife took a dip in one of the maggot pits and had a horrible acci –

She caught herself before her mind spiralled off, returning to her usual self. “You’re lucky you look good, otherwise I would have thrown you into the training arena for the rest of your life.”

The arctech radio on Merissa’s belt buzzed, crackling to life. [Ms. Merissa, the boss is here.]

At the entrance to the goblin mine, the defenses had been improved significantly. Instead of makeshift wooden fences, it was metal spikes atop newly fortified stone walls reinforced with support beams, with intimidating watch towers providing the lookouts a good overview over the front. The area in front had been cleared out of trees, preventing anyone from sneaking all the way up to the walls.

Near the gate, there was an honor guard procession to receive Kyle, who walked in accompanied by a meek-looking human who was carrying what seemed to be prospecting equipment. Kyle nodded in approval as he inspected the guards, noticing the apparent improvement that the months of training had done to Gulak’s tribe.

“Mister Kyle, you promised me that I would be safe here!” The meek person whispered urgently to Kyle as he nearly flinched from the snarl of a goblin warrior who stood at attention along the side.

“You are. This will be your home for the next year or so. Once you’re finished with the prospecting and mining for minerals, consider your debts to the Seven Snakes cleared.” Kyle replied.

The meek person reluctantly nodded as he was reminded of his casino debt, sighing internally to himself. The group was met by Merissa and Feldon, who bowed to Kyle. “Everything okay?”

“Yes, sir. We have prepared everything in advance.”

“Mister Raksha.”

The prospector jolted to attention as they began to enter the mining tunnels. “Yes, Mister Kyle!”

“I need an answer by today or so. I’ve heard you are one of the best in town. Keith spoke highly of you, and I’m on a tight schedule. Any delay would be… detrimental to our working relationship. And your health.”

Raksha shuddered slightly at the insidious threat but stood his ground, his professional expertise coming to bear. “Prospecting a brand new mine from scratch is hardly an easy task, especially when there’s barely any infrastructure left to support it…”

“Merissa.” Kyle called out, with Merissa immediately moving over to him. “Explain what you have prepared for him.”

“Yes, sir. Mr. Raksha, we have prospecting surveys from the previous mine owners and a team of elder goblins who have lived in the mine for decades. They will assist you in your search for any minerals.”

“And did the surveys’ mention any traces of iron ore?” Raksha inquired.

“They did not. But they did not mention traces of arcite ore as well, but as you can see here…” Merissa motioned towards some of the excavated arcite ore from the shaman inscription chambers.

“Arcite ore? Here?” Raksha was shocked. “If you monetise it, you could –“ He stopped himself before he continued, noticing Kyle’s clearly irritated face.

"Do try to keep business ideas to yourself, especially those that require a direct license from the Emperor himself to operate." Merissa warned.

"But you guys are hardly lega-"

"That does not mean we try to draw attention to ourselves." Kyle snapped. "I would appreciate if you would focus on the task at hand."

They continued to walk down the converted tunnels, with Raksha obviously surprised at the increased level of infrastructure. None of the arctech lights were flickering, with utility pipes clearly running along the length of the tunnel, providing flowing water and air ventilation into the area. A few air ducts could be seen as well as he passed a tunnel-in-progress that was clearly leading in the direction of Raktor, with goblins hauling out rubble from the consistent digging.

It was already a big surprise to him that a human group would be in charge of such a large goblin operation. Goblins were notoriously hard to govern and could easily start a rebellion due to their sheer numbers that increased over time. He had heard of previous attempts by the Yual Dominion to subjugate this area but had always lost or suffered too many losses against the major goblin tribes.

Raksha began to scan the tunnels, taking note of the various formations of rocks layered into the tunnels, which changed as they went deeper and deeper into the goblin den. They soon reached a foyer of sorts, a large open space where various market stalls were opened, peddling various foods imported in from the town.

At the very far end of the foyer, a manual pulley system ran by a series of sweating goblins hauled arcite ore to and fro towards a separate entrance, where the mechanical wind regenerators had been installed. Half of the arcite ores were being shipped to Raktor, with new depleted ones coming in everyday in a non-stop routine. The mechanical regenerator was hardly efficient, but Kyle had more than enough goblin slaves to make up for it.

Kyle brought Raksha to the main administrative office, which has been expanded greatly. It was now a three-level cavern lit with arctech lanterns powered by regenerators, with each floor having multiple clerks, both human and goblins working hard to manage the logistics of the entire den. Rows upon rows of paper were slotted away neatly on carved stone shelves, organized according to chronological date for better ease of access. It was here where the bulk of the Euria Seeds collection was tallied up and accounted for.

On top of that, the administrative office also acted as a de facto government of sorts. With the absorption of the second tribe to boost their worker numbers, the number of goblins living in the den right now was more than six hundred, nearing the size of a big town.

Since Kyle wanted total control over the entire operation, Merissa had no choice but to hire clerks to assist her, even splintering some of them off into separate ministries to cover different tasks aimed at supporting the current workforce.

As Feldon showed Raksha where all the old survey documents were collected as well as introduced him to the team of elder goblins, Kyle walked around with Merissa, observing the work of the clerks. “You’ve done a very good job of teaching the goblins how to read and write.”

“Thank you, sir. It is but my duty.” Merissa bowed.

“Where is the envoy?”

“Sasha is still currently interrogating him, over here.” Merissa led him to an adjacent holding room, where the envoy was currently screaming its lungs out from the torturous pain that Sasha was inflicting on him.

The envoy spat a glob of blood on the ground as soon as Kyle entered the holding room. Instead of talking directly to the envoy, Kyle turned to Merissa. “Estimate of their combat potential and capabilities?”

“As far as I can tell, we can easily overpower them. The soldiers were ill-trained and fled at the first sight of their comrade’s corpses. The envoy, however, is of stronger will, as you can see here.”

“Any advanced technologies?”

“Nothing of the sort. They even disdain bows and arrows with a passion. All we have is their iron spear and iron shield.” Merissa motioned to a few of the captured weapons lying on the side.

Kyle picked them up slowly, twirling the spear in his hand with ease.

MG404: [Item | Crude Goblin Spear (Basic) | A copy of a human spear. | No Active Skills.]

The balance was clearly off, but it did not seem that the spearhead had been crafted out of iron bacteria, rather it looked as though it had been smoothly refined, proving that the goblins had methods of iron refinement.

“Can we negotiate with them?”

“As far as we know, no. The envoy is very… opposed to humans.”

< Of course, you are simply hairless monkeys, skulking and backstabbing instead of fighting with pride and honor! > The envoy understood the human language but refused to speak back in it instead.

Kyle walked right up to the chair in which the envoy was tied up to, before delivering a straight punch to the face, nearly crumpling the envoy’s already crooked nose. Blood spurted out of its orifices as the chair flipped over, its head smacking against the cold hard barren earth.

< I will give you a chance. > Kyle spoke in the goblin’s language, leaning over. < Tell us everything you know about the kingdom. >  

  

< I will only wish the worst of curses on your ancestors’ spirits and your descendants’ future, may their lives be filled with rot and sorrow, and their hearts pierced by the sword of Sahusa! > The envoy roared back in rage, kicking and fighting against its restraints.

< I don’t take insults lightly. > Kyle instantly grabbed the envoy by the neck, crushing it with both hands in a tight grip before tossing the twitching corpse aside. “Throw his body into the maggot pit, but don’t forget to use a light-capturer first of his demise. Make sure everyone in the den knows of this.”

Merissa and Sasha barely flinched nor blinked at the ruthlessness with which Kyle had acted out, nonchalantly getting a few goblin slaves to carry out the order. The treatment of the royal envoy spread like wildfire through the rumours and light-capturer flims, further entrenching the strength and brutality of their human overlords in the goblins living in the den, making them less reluctant to go against Kyle and his rule.

"Sir, killing the envoy could be seen as an act of war." Merissa pointed out as they walked back through the den, many of the goblin slaves cowering in fear.

"We've already attacked another tribe, and our very act of enslaving this tribe is an act of war against the kingdom. We were going to fight them sooner or later, and judging from the quality of their weapons, I expect any war to be swift."

Kyle soon returned to the office, where Raksha had just completed his discussion with the goblin clerks and Feldon.

“Mr. Kyle.” Raksha scurried over, holding a few documents in his hands. “I have yet to survey the area personally, but I find that most of this document is accurate and precise. The formation of arcite ore might not be well known, but iron ore is very well documented.”

“Get to the point. Is there iron ore or not?”

“No sir. There is a very, very low chance of iron ore here in this specific den. Most of the iron here would be trapped in forms that would be exceptionally hard to extract. None of the oxides we normally use would be found here, as there was a clear lack of oxygen and water before the mine was opened.”

“So what’s the solution?”

“I… I don’t have any. I think this mine is done for. You might find other things like coal, but you won’t find much iron ore here.”

“Then we’ll just have to get it elsewhere. Sasha, gather all the warriors and prepare for an assault. We’re taking over the goblin kingdom, one den at a time.”
# Chapter 64 - Regicide

Sahusa the Great was not having a good time, contrary to popular belief.

It was not the fact that he was named after a myth of his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, or that the name automatically implied that he was a goblin ladykiller or that he had five arms. Of course, those made him irrationally angry as well.

But what really irked him was the bickering of the five goblin tribe leaders in front of him, which had been going on for nearly five days in a row now. And he, as the Goblin King, had to sit here and listen for hours and hours on end while surviving individual meetings with each of the tribe leaders in order to hold everything together.

< King Sahusa! Are you listening to the foul words of this weakling? He should have his tongue chopped off immediately! >

< Just like your grandfather and your predecessor. Perhaps you should be the one to have your tongue chopped off so as to continue the tradition of insolence! >

King Sahusa sighed. *It’s only been a year since I took over, and yet everything has gone to waste.* Sahusa kind of regretted assassinating his father now. He had always thought that ruling as a king was the ultimate goal, but here he was, forced to slave away and listen to old farts grumble and argue with each other.

< How dare you! You take that back now! For the last four days, I have been tolerating your ill-mannered speech, but no longer! Fail to rescind your words, and there will be war! >

< Threatening civil war in front of the king? How daring! What can you possibly do? >

< SILENCE! > Sahusa was enraged now, his bottled fury bursting forwards as he stood up. < I have listened to you old farts for long enough now! I have tried at every twist and turn to explain exactly what we need to do in order to alleviate the loss of tribute! >

< Bah! It’s simple! We go to war! Just like we always have! As long as we can get past the female human monster, it will be an easy win for us! Gulak and his weak tribesman can hardly fight back against us! > An arrogant hobgoblin crossed his arms, flexing his muscles and the skulls mounted on his shoulder.

< Osir, you’re such a fool! My scouts have seen their strength – their equipment is far beyond our comprehension! What we need to do is to negotiate and trade with them, then, we will be able to alleviate the famine that is plaguing us now. > Another scrawny old tribe leader pointed out.

< I agree with Elder Ulthan, we should find another human group to support us: not all humans are aligned with each other! We can use that to our advantage and gain technology like them. > A third tribe leader spoke.

Osir grunted as he slammed his fist on the table, causing the entire wooden surface to reverberate < Then we will be merely a proxy war, just like the Heavenly War! Have your mothers not taught you anything while you were still a child? If it were not for our ancestors, we would still be enslaved by them! >

< What did you say about my mother!? >

< SHUT UP! > Sahusa interrupted the conversation, raising a scepter in his hand that was completely covered in dense engraving. The scepter seemed to amplify his voice as it glowed. The tribe leaders tried to talk but realised that their voices could not be heard by anyone but themselves.

< With the power vested into me as the Goblin King, I command all five tribe leaders: This meeting shall be adjourned, and the final decision shall be made by me in three days! I will not entertain any petitions nor individual meetings! > King Sahusa put his foot down, before storming off out of the meeting hut

He grumbled to himself as two servants immediately fell into line behind him, keeping pace as he pushed aside the cloth marking the entrance to the meeting hut, and stepped out.

The meeting hut was positioned on a cliff overlooking the valley between to Culdao Peaks mountains. He stormed down a stone path that was carved out of the valley’s slope, leading to a small palace that was embedded into the mountain in a large alcove.

Sahusa sighed loudly, stopping to take a look at the valley. The goblin city was large but was mostly made of mud, wood and stone mined from the mountains. They were dispersed through the long valley save for a central market area, where he could see thousands of goblins clamouring for the latest meat or cave carrots and mushrooms to eat, nearly trampling over each other or fighting non-stop.

His warriors were working around the clock to maintain the peace, but even he could tell that exhaustion would soon hit them. *This is not sustainable; I must find a solution immediately.*

< I will consult the Oracle now. Prepare for the ritual. >

The servants gasped, looking at each other. It was a once-in-a-lifetime event to consult the Oracle – nearly no one living had seen it in person. Sahusa himself had not personally seen it, but the procedure has been passed down through stone tablet inscriptions over the generations.

The last time it was done was four generations ago. The servants quickly scrambled, reading up on all the ancient texts of how to consult the Oracle.

An hour passed before King Sahusa was prepared. < Your Majesty, your robe. > The servants put on a ceremonial robe on him, one that was pure white in nature and had sharp corners on the shoulder pads, along with a weird extra flap of fabric near the breast pocket with a series of letters that he could not read. The fabric was unique, something that not even the best goblin shamans or elders could replicate in their lifetime, the threads fine and precise like an artifact from the heavens.

The procession paraded down towards a grand cave at the end of the palace, which led to a large metal door, reflective enough for King Sahusa to see his handsome face in it. < Recite the heavenly numbers in order. >

< Yes, Your Majesty. >

The goblin servants began to read off the ancient texts, following the directed pronunciation as guided. They struggled with many of the intonations, causing the words they spoke to sound like an accent of a foreign language that Sahusa had never heard of before.

As soon as they finished reading the text, a large red light above the door came to life, with a klaxon suddenly blaring out an alarming sound in different tones, scaring King Sahusa as weird metallic contraptions popped out from hidden crevices near the door, each having an ominous pipe aimed right at them.

< RETREAT! > He roared, prompting the servants to immediately scamper out of the grand cave and back into the valley. The retreat was hasty and disorganized, making the procession look like a foolish endeavor. While King Sahusa cursed his inability to consult the Oracle, his servants whispered to each other vigourously. 

< What was that?! I had never heard anything like that before?! >

< Perhaps the Oracle was angry at us and wanted us gone! Are we doomed? What are we going to do now? >

King Sahusa felt dejected, recalling the myths of the Oracle told to him by his father. The Oracle was the reason why his tribe was even able to dominate nearly half of the goblins in the Culdao Peaks Area, making them the superior ones.

*If the Oracle does not even want to help me, what hope do I have left?* King Sahusa began to ponder his options.

*Starting a war during a famine is one way, but I must be assured of victory. A prolonged conflict would only cause more issues.* Sahusa returned to his room, planning while using a makeshift map of the area as known by the goblins.

It was a given that the area could only support so many goblins’ hunting and foraging in the forest and caves, which served as a natural barrier to the population.

However, Sahusa was not content with simply letting his people starve nor send them off to war simply to cull the number of heads to feed. He did not want to be callous, but the thought continued to remain in the back of his mind as a potentially easy way out.

Before he could think further, a warrior barged into a room, panting heavily. < King Sahusa! The scouts have reported that another two tribes has fallen to Gulak! >

< What?! > King Sahusa stood in shock. He had thought the expansion of Gulak would be slow and measured – but two tribes in a single day was a completely absurd notion to Sahusa. *Not even the original Sahusa managed to achieve that in the tales!*

< Have you told any of the other tribe leaders? > Sahusa asked.

< No, your Majesty, but the scouts might have told them directly as well! >

King Sahusa’s eyes widened in shock. “Quickly assemble all my warriors for battle! We must-“ His words were caught in his throat as he could already hear the cries of his servants and the sounds of metal clashing echoing through the stone palace. < We must defend our territory, now! >

< Y-yes sir! > The warrior scampered off, while Sahusa walked into a separate room, his personal armoury where his father’s armour rested – a full steel armour stolen from a young human noble, complete with an arming sword.

Before he could put it on, however, the door to the armoury was blasted open, with more than fifteen goblin warriors under Osir’s command entering. They immediately tackled the king to the ground in a rush, pinning down and restraining him.

< Attempting to run away while you let our entire society collapse, are we? I had high hopes for you when you assassinated your father. I thought that ‘Finally! We have a proper leader willing to do whatever it takes.’ Yet when the first news of a tribe being taken reached you, all you did was stick your head in the sand! >

< I was not planning to ru- >

< Even when the delegation by Envoy Erasg sent was massacred by the female human monster, you barely made a move, not even bothering to increase our forces or improve our equipment! The position of the king is wasted on you! >

< If you do this, the other four tribes will turn on you! > Sahusa shot back as he was forced to kneel on the floor.

Osir let out a hearty chuckle. < And you think the other four tribes are supportive of your position? FOOL! Strength is the only currency in this society! As we speak, your warriors are being cut down by the dozens! >

Sahusa was about to retort before Osir delivered a kick, slamming the jaw of Sahusa with force. < Useless! Drag this worthless king out to the balcony so the people can see how pitful he looks! >

Sahusa struggled against his restraints as he was dragged unceremoniously through the hallway. The bodies of his servants and loyal warriors were strewn across the palace’s many corridors, the stench of blood and meat filling the air as more and more rebel goblin warriors entered the palace. The rebel warriors did not seem shocked by the turn of events, raiding and pillaging the palace and digging out all the valuable goods.

< You… You have been planning this for a long time! How dare you! >

< An incompetent king who is oblivious to what ferments under his feet. > Osir scoffed as he marched ahead of his warriors.

They soon reached the balcony, where the true scale of the devastation caused by the rebels was made obvious to King Sahusa. Tens of thousands of goblins were embroiled in fighting and fleeing, with the battle raging all across the entire length of the valley. Everything was being pillaged while the loyal warriors of Sahusa’s tribe continued to fight for their lives.

< Your entire tribe shall be purged from this area! I will make sure you are the last one to die, so you can see how your bloodline falters into nothingness. Sahusa the Great is no more! >

The rebel warriors strung Sahusa up onto a pole, hoisting him up high over the valley. Osir grabbed the sceptre handed to him by a warrior before activating it and amplifying his voice over the entire valley, echoing off the slopes and mountains.

[< Behold! Your incompetent king who has led us into famine and hardship! As of today, he is no longer our king, for I will be yours! >] Osir declared through the sceptre, shouting over the land. The rebel soldiers cheered in response as they continued to fight, while the loyal warriors’ morale began to deplete rapidly as they saw their king captured.

The common goblins were also quickly surrendering, unwilling to fight any longer to the death against a losing cause. What reason was there to defend for a king that has already been captured?

[< But I will be different – as your new king, I will herald a new golden age for all goblins in this holy land! >] Osir shouted a warcry, echoed by his rebel troops that were now locked in a civil war over the vast valley.

< Tribe Leader, do we kill the king now? I have a method I would like to - > A warrior asked, earning a slap to the face.

< Idiot! He still holds value to us. No one here is to kill him without my command. >

Osir ordered them to drag Sahusa down from the pole. Sahusa smirked as he knelt on the ground. < So, what do you want from me? You have pillaged everything I have. Perhaps you want the name of Sahusa the Great as well? The riches of my palace? >

< Don’t play jokes with me. I have no use for your filthy gold and worthless paintings. You know what I want. I want the Oracle. >
# Chapter 65 - Counterattack

The targeted goblin den fell swiftly, unable to fend off Sasha and her trained warriors. Their shabbily constructed defences made from adventurer gear and decrepit Yual Dominion equipment were ran over within a short three hours. Kyle did not even take part in the raid, leaving it as experience for the new attack force.

< Move faster! > Gulak grinned as he slapped the back of a captured goblin, who was shambling off in a line, heading off back to the main goblin den. < You will now follow the orders of those of the First Tribe and me! >

Kyle did not concern himself with how the goblins were being assimilated, as he already expected the first batch of goblins that he dominated to create a class hierarchy. This meant that Gulak and his tribe were motivated to capture and ensure that the new goblins did not overthrow their newfound power.

*By creating a class divide between them, I can have them focus their energy and anger on each other rather than the humans running the operation…* It was a common tactic that many leaders of the Galactic Era have implemented and perfected since the first human empire was born on Ancient Earth.

The total number of goblins under Kyle now neared a thousand in total, composed of three different tribes. Gulak’s First Tribe had transitioned into being the administrative wing as well as the overseers. Gulak had also elevated the Second Tribe, creating the class pyramid in order to retain order.

Now, they were herded back to the goblin den of Gulak for ‘re-education’, where they would be subjected to continuous displays of modern technology and increased living standards. It was not wrong to say that despite their enslaved status, their standard of living was far better than what they had previously.

“Food is going to be a problem. Merissa, you were working on sustaining the goblins previously, any ideas?”

“Yes sir. Due to the Culdao Peaks being a volcanic formation in the past, the soil around the entire forest area is arable and can be used to grow certain crops. With the addition of this den, we might be able to acquire enough land area, though it will take time to become self-sustaining. Right now, we have been importing food from the Culdao Peaks Town.”

*With the increased number of goblins, such an agricultural project becomes even more critical to complete. We can temporarily sustain the population with food bought via the Euria Seeds trading system, but this won’t be sustainable in the long term.* Kyle sighed, adding yet another problem to deal with on the list. Yet it was a good problem to have – if it came to it, he could simply cull half of the goblins, but he would prefer to sustain the large workforce where possible. *After all, they are more useful alive than dead.*

He did not follow the new goblins back to the den, instead remaining in the den that had just been captured to inspect it. Sasha was resting with the troops while Merissa and Feldon assessed the state of the den to ascertain if it could be connected back to the main goblin den.

“It’s not too far in terms of distance, but we would need some serious tunneling equipment if we wanted to link everything up properly. A rudimentary tunnel system is possible by hand, but could be dangerous. We already had a few cave-ins in the first den.” Merissa pointed out to Kyle.

Creating such heavy equipment would definitely not be easy – Kyle was not even sure if he could get it done within two months. It could be done extremely fast if he duplicated the automated mining equipment he knew from the Galactic Era, but he had to weigh the pros and cons of it.

“For now, let Raksha map out the area and see what’s the possibility of digging out a tunnel normally to link up with the main one being dug. We need to prospect this den as well, see if there is anything of value.” Kyle replied. Given the number of goblins under him, it was possible to do a rotation shift and provide arctech hand drills to chew away at the rock and reuse existing abandoned networks. It would certainly be easier to implement than an entire tunnelling machine and digging through new rock.

Raksha was now busy prospecting and checking every nook and cranny of the den as far as he could with the assistance of captured elder goblins. Kyle hoped that at least a bit of iron ore would be found so they could begin building a distribution system for the factory to begin with. It wouldn’t be enough in the short term, with Kyle still having to purchase from suppliers in Raktor to make up for the shortfall, but at least it was some amount of savings.

Just as Kyle was about to leave the den, an excited Raksha quickly ran up to him. “I’ve found it! I’ve found it! Here’s the motherlode!” Raksha’s face was covered in black dirt, his hand holding a few crumbling pieces of black rock.

Kyle’s eyes immediately widened, picking up the rock and feeling it for himself. “Coal. You found a coal seam?”

“Indeed! I cannot determine if there is more than one layer yet, but there is definitely a layer right here that we can dig right into!”

“Merissa, Feldon, you hear that?”

“Yes, sir!” Merissa nodded. “I’ll have them prepare the roof supports and the ventilation immediately. I assume this makes the tunnel even more important?”

Kyle nodded. “Every goblin worker that’s not fighting is to focus on this project – we need it done within a week. The steel production line to support the weapons' factory is to be completed within the next month, so I want the distribution network up and running even before the tunnel is ready.”

“The network will be slow if we use the same method that we use for the Euria Seeds, the wagons will take more than a day to get to Raktor.” Feldon pointed out.

“That’s a temporary solution for now. Once we’re done with pacifying the area, we’ll start laying rails in the dug-out tunnel for faster distribution.”

Kyle returned to the outside, where Sasha was desperately trying to train the goblins to shoot the handguns that he had brought. It was not going well, with the goblins being too far used to the bows trained under Kyle. A few pellets went wide, nearly nicking other goblins in ear or ricocheting off the rocks far behind the targets placed for practice.

[Sir, I don’t think it’s possible for us to distribute the extra handguns to the goblins right now. I fear we may suffer more casualties than expected.] Sasha spoke through the wireless channel.

Kyle nodded. It was impossible to train a human to be a sharpshooter within a day or two, so he did not have high hopes for the goblins in the first place. “Not a problem. We’ll do it the old-fashioned way, then. Any news from our forward scouts?”

[They claim there’s been rioting over the past day in the central territory, but we have not heard back from them in a while.]

“When was their last check-in supposed to be?”

[About ten hours ago.]

Kyle contemplated for a while, arranging the possible events that might result in the scouts not reporting back in. *The highest possibility is that they are dead. Which means an assault force is on its way.* “Mobilize all the warriors immediately. Prepare for an attack soon.”

Sasha did not question the order, immediately signaling with her hands and passing down the message through the ranks. The goblin warriors and human squad leaders were all confused, murmuring among each other. The differences in race hardly mattered to them anymore as they fought side by side, many bonds forged through the battles and shared despair of Sasha’s training routine.

Kyle took stock of the number of troops left. Some of them had been diverted to escorting the newly captured goblins back, which meant he was left with a diminished fighting force that was also slightly tired.

“Sasha, scout ahead and report. Carry an arctech lantern.” Kyle ordered, prompting Sasha to scale up the mountain immediately with the lantern, leaping from rock to ledge and trying to get a bird’s eye view of the forest that surrounded the mountain.

“The rest of you will split up into two groups. Both groups will head away from the mountain, two kilometers that way. Keep a line of sight here. Once you see the signal, you will rush back here and flank the attackers. Got it?”

The warriors nodded first before they began to mumble among themselves again. One of the humans raised his hand, picking up the courage to ask Kyle. “Sorry, but what’s the signal?”

“Sasha will flash the lantern towards you. Prepare everything and leave now.”

Following Kyle’s orders, they split into two groups of fifty each, heading deep into the forest away from the mountain. With this, only Kyle was left at the mine, save for Merissa, Feldon and the other goblin workers still prospecting with Raksha.

[Sir, significant troop movement spotted.]

“Estimates?”

[About two hundred goblins.]

“Then it is an even fight.”

Kyle checked his armour, hammer and arctech handgun. The railgun was hard to use in such a dense forest, so he needed close-range weapons that were reusable. The handgun could only be reloaded twice with the number of magazines slotted in his belt.

The sounds of marching footsteps and drums began to reach Kyle’s ears. The noise echoed into the goblin den, prompting Merissa to come out, astonished at where all the warriors went.

“Stay inside the den. I am going to block the tunnel.” Kyle hefted a few large boulders and broken, abandoned mining equipment to stuff the entrance, ensuring that none of the enemy goblins could enter the den while he was fighting.

@@@

A loud horn blared across the forest in a rapid burst of three blows, causing the birds of the forest to fly away en-masse as the drums continued to pound.

Two hundred armored goblins and hobgoblins were moving in formation while the leader of the force was atop a horse, a skull cap above his head.

< How far to the tribe? > He asked a servant who was walking barefoot, carrying his equipment.

< About a hundred steps or more, sir >

< HALT! > The leader held up his fist, prompting the force to immediately stop and form a defensive formation, with the goblins carrying heavy steel shields positioned at the front. None of them had any bows, as bows were seen to be used only by weak pointy-ear elves.

The leader motioned to a goblin messenger, who nodded and grabbed a stone tablet from his backpack, climbing up a tree.

[< Gulak, traitor to the Goblin King! Repent for your sins of collaborating with human groups to starve the goblins, as well as capturing the blessed envoy of King Sahusa, Envoy Erasg! You have ten seconds to surrender yourself, else, there shall be no mercy! >] The goblin messenger screamed through a makeshift wooden loudhailer, amplifying his voice over the treeline, echoing off the slope of the mountain.

Nothing in the forest moved save for the breathing motion of the goblins, who held their swords and spears at the ready, keeping their eyes peeled for anything in the distance or through the dense foliage that obscured much of their vision.

A fearful young goblin who had been conscripted into the force was slightly trembling as he gripped his spear, sweat glands causing him to lose his purchase on the handle. < Wh..what if the female human monster appears?! >

< Bah! The humans are not that strong! There are nearly two hundred of us here! > An older goblin smacked the back of the young goblin heartily. < If she appears, then claiming her head and eating the maggots from her remains will be the best achievement of your life! >

The young goblin nodded slightly, still unconvinced. The minute of silence passed slowly, with every pulse of his blood thumping in his ears as he lost track of time.

< A minute is up. > The leader announced. < Prepare to mov- >

The words were caught in the leader’s throat as a lone human male appeared in the distance, walking slowly towards them.

< Who is that? An accomplice of the female human monster? > The leader was flustered, having heard horror stories from the survivors of the envoy’s disastrous attempt. < Kill him, kill him now! >

The goblins were all stunned but soon steeled their hearts and charged. They split up and jumped over the roots of tree branches and fallen logs, rushing at the human male.

A smirk appeared on the human male’s face as he brandished an ornamental handgun, a copy of the Oriental Bloom.

*Intimidation Aura!*

Suddenly, every goblin who had their eyes locked on Kyle froze in fear, with nearly half of them stopping and turning around. Even the leader of the goblin felt it, his heart nearly skipping a beat as he felt the eyes of a predator land on his skin, the goosebumps sending a tingle through his spine.

Kyle quickly aimed the handgun, firing rapidly with precision at the goblins who were frozen with fear. Within the first second, two goblins were already crumpling to the floor, and a tunnel formed through their heads.

[MG404: System Message | Killed : [Goblin Warrior] | +50 EXP]

The sounds of the shots jolted those who were still stationary and prompted them to move.

< Stay calm! Wait for him to run out of projectiles, and then we will attack together! > An older goblin that had fought against the Yual Dominion before yelled at the top of his lungs.

Kyle took the advantage to dance around the trees, using the trunks as cover as he darted in and out, sniping at the goblins who failed to conceal their heads completely amongst the foilage.

In the first thirty seconds, nearly a dozen had already died, with the fear amplified by the Intimidation Aura. More and more goblins began to flee, running back. The young goblin, too, lost his composure, screaming as he ran away. However, a javelin was tossed towards him, landing right in front of him and causing him to shriek in fear.

The leader and his elite troops were now on the ground, fighting against the Intimidation Aura. < Run from the battle, and you will be killed! Fight! >

The continuous threat did not work until the leader impaled one of the deserting runners with a thrown javelin. < COWARDS! TURN AND FIGHT! >

As the fleeing goblins rallied once more and rushed at Kyle, they noticed Kyle reloading, with a metal block dropping out of the handgun.

< NOW! ATTACK! > The experienced older goblin roared, charging out with his own spear and lunging at Kyle.

*Penchant for Violence!*

Kyle’s speed increased, his hand swiftly retrieving the magazine in his belt and reloading the handgun in an instant. In a blitz spray, he retrieved his hammer and swung at the incoming attackers while he used his other hand to fire the handgun non-stop. Running out of pellets, he swerved out of the way as a spear lunged towards him, slamming the barrel of his handgun into the chin of the attacker like a blunt weapon.

Despite his overwhelming strength, he only had so many pellets on hand, and there were still more than a hundred fifty goblins attempting to surround and corner him.

[Sasha, give the signal!]

[Sir, I’m not sure if the lantern will be strong enough to attract their attention; they might not see it.]

[Don’t worry about it, I’ll provide an additional signal.]

Kyle grinned as he sheathed his now empty handgun, grabbing the nearest goblin and lifting him high. With an extremely strong toss, Kyle braced his legs as he flung the screaming goblin out beyond the treeline towards the flanking groups. Its scream echoed off the peaks, resounding throughout the nearby area.

“That should be good enough.”
# Chapter 66 - Infiltration

All across the forest laid strewn armour and bloodied corpses of goblins and hobgoblins alike, with already a few scouting insects prodding their mandibles into the fresh flesh, tugging it apart piece by piece. Goblins under Kyle scoured the battlefield, happily capturing any remaining survivors and requisitioning their weapons and gear for themselves.

The battle was over in less than thirty minutes, with the flanking groups attacking from the sides, along with Sasha flanking from the mountain. The armored goblins and hobgoblins sent by Osir were no match for the sneaky archers and tough fighters trained by Sasha and Kyle.

Kyle himself had exhausted all his ammo, though he could easily form new pellets back at the goblin den. The arctech handgun was a simple gadget that accelerated projectiles, so there was no need for any complicated bullet production, though it could only store a limited amount.

He breathed deeply as he calmed himself down, stepping over the drying pools of blood and corpses that laid out in front of him. Kyle had lost count of how many goblins he had killed, simply fighting wildly with all his strength.

Kyle dismissed the holographic system message from his field of view, deciding to deal with it later. Right now, he marched up to the leader of the attacking force, who was tied up and kneeling on the ground along with the rest of the goblins who surrendered, its mouth bleeding profusely as a few of its sharp yellow teeth were scattered on the floor. Sasha grabbed its head, lifting it up to face Kyle.

He motioned for another goblin to perform the interpretation, interrogating the leader. “How many warriors are left in your territory?”

< Pah, afraid are we? > The leader grinned through bloodied gums. < If I don’t return within two cycles, a thousand goblins will be sent here! >

“A thousand warriors…. Interesting.” Kyle contemplated his options. “Sasha, get Gulak here immediately, along with fifty baskets of food. Take them from the storage.”

Kyle spun as he ordered the remaining warriors. “The rest of you, pick up the equipment and wear it. Smear the mud and blood on your faces.”

The warriors glanced at each other before it finally caught on as to what Kyle wanted to do. They quickly spread out across the battlefield, picking apart the broken equipment and wearing them wholesale.

The leader of the attacking force was stunned, watching the wide-scale battlefield salvage operation happening as Sasha sprinted off to fetch Gulak. < Filthy human! What are you planning to do? >

@@@

Bresir tapped his crossed arms slowly, silently overlooking the city where remnants of burning houses and huts still sent smoke spiralling through the air like black pillars of heaven. It’s been a full cycle since Osir had delegated Bresir as the head general in charge of the newly formed army.

He was a hobgoblin, much larger and stronger than a normal goblin – closer to the average build of a human. This allowed him to wear the human knight armor stolen years ago, making him look like a proper armored general.

The market square at the very center of the Culado Peaks kingdom that used to trade in food and forage was stripped down to form a large parade square, where thousands of goblins were queuing up for their strictly controlled rations, a stopgap measure to prevent a catastrophic famine.

Bresir felt a slight tremble on his feet, glancing down to notice the goblin merchant that he was stepping out trying to squirm, the merchant’s arms shaking violently as he tried to support himself on all fours.

< Enjoying the view? Your market square has been turned to dust, and the food has been given out to the people. >

< I-I-I’ve worked hard for that food! You have no idea how much I hav- >

Bresir stomped on the back of the merchant, breaking his spine and causing the merchant to squirm on the floor in pain. < It is YOU who have no idea how much hurt and grief you have brought to society. I detest the king for introducing currency and the market – food is food, and should be equally distributed to all! >

He bent down to grab the goblin merchant by the neck, lifting him high above and causing his short legs to dangle wildly as the merchant kicked the air in response. < And all you did was sit back and wait for the workers to bring you the money. Pathetic! A warrior’s society has no place for your greedy ilk! Begone! >

He slammed the merchant onto the ground, knocking him out. < Drag him to the caves – let him forage for his own food. Or he can feed the maggot piles with his own flesh. >

Two rebel warriors complied, dragging the merchant off as Bresir continued to observe the area. There were still small pockets of resistance; loyal knights of the former king holed up in caves along the slopes of the valley. Battles were still erupting as some refused to fall under the new system.

*What is Osir doing?* Bresir wondered. The new Goblin King had taken all his best troops and holed themselves up in the palace. Some rumours among the rebels were saying that Osir was simply taking over to enjoy the luxuries of the palace, forgetting about the people. Bresir did not want to believe it, but he couldn’t help thinking that there was a modicum of truth to it.

Suddenly, a loud clamour erupted from the queue of goblins waiting for their food rations. Two goblins were rolling and tumbling on the ground, embroiled in a scuffle as the maggots in their bowls were thrown high up into the air.

The queue of goblins immediately broke formation as the nearest goblins lunged for the maggots on the ground, stuffing the soil and maggots into their mouth while the fighting spread, encompassing nearly more than a hundred goblins.

Bresir grunted, immediately rushing down with a squad of rebel soldiers to disperse the crowd.

< STOP! > Bresir yelled, moving forward with the rebel soldiers and shoving the brawl’s participants apart. The soldiers grabbed each of them and dragged them out before restraining them with twine and rope.

Bresir forced his way into the middle of the brawl before bellowing out in a roar. < BY THE NAME OF OSIR THE BRAVE – STOP! >

The shout stunned the participants, allowing the soldiers to act quickly. More and more rebel soldiers entered the fray, reducing the number of rioters and fighters punching each other or scrambling for maggots.

Some of the goblins were heavily injured, moaning as they lay on the ground. Bresir laid eyes on the original culprit, who was still fighting and swinging wildly.

With a charge, Bresir immediately charged and tackled the culprit head-on, slamming him into the ground and pinning him with the sheer weight of his well-built body as well as knight armour.

He grabbed the culprit by the neck, keeping a tight grip. < You! I don’t care what reason you have for fighting; you are henceforth conscripted into the army. The rest of you! Arrest every goblin who fought here. If you have enough energy to fight – then fight against Gulak and his tribe, who have betrayed us! >

The goblin onlookers all murmured in agreement. < Indeed. If Gulak had not been greedy, we would not have a famine now… >

< Gulak has taken over yet another tribe; will this area eventually be embroiled in war as well? >

< Fear not, for I will defend this place with my life! No enemy will get past me. You can count on me! > Bresir promised to the people with heartfelt sincerity. He truly believed in Osir’s vision for a new golden age for the goblins, hoping to unify the tribes into a single race that could work for a better future.

Many of the onlookers could truly feel his sincerity, cheering for him. < Round them up and drag them to the camp for training! Beat them if they refuse. No mercy for offenders! >

Bresir waved to the crowd and stayed a bit longer to help those who had suffered collateral damage, though they did not have enough herbs nor poultices to mend and heal wounds. *It’s been a cycle since I sent the strike force to attack them… if they were successful, the scouts should have reported back by now…*

< General Bresir! > A goblin scout reported by coincidence, bowing deeply. < We have received word that Leader Qatu is successful! He has captured Gulak and brought back fifty baskets worth of food! >

Bresir’s jaw nearly dropped before he shook himself out of his stupor. *This… this is unbelievable! A miracle!* < Quickly, help them bring in the food to distribute to the people! > Bresir frantically ordered, organizing the remaining soldiers towards the main gate.

A simple wall of wood and stone controlled the entry into the valley, with observers posted along every interval. Bresir rushed to the gate, which was a basic wooden door barred with a rotten decaying wooden beam. The guards gritted their teeth as they lifted the heavy wooden beam, opening the gate for the victorious force returning home with the salvation of the famine.

Bresir squinted his eyes, noticing the visage of the two hundred goblins returning through the tree line. However, his excitement soon turned to dismay as he noticed how badly injured the goblin force was.

Many of them had broken equipment and bloodied limbs, while some were limping, soaked to the bone in mud and blood. Others were wrapped in makeshift bandages from the leaves of Euria Seeds trees, hobbling as they carried the baskets of food.

The guards of the wall quickly rushed forward to carry the basket of food, helping them carry them in. < Call all the shamans well-versed in healing to come over quickly! > Bresir quickly ordered as he went down himself to meet Leader Qatu, whose face had been badly bruised.

< Qatu, what happened? Did you defeat the humans? >

< We did, but at a loss. I managed to capture Gulak at the cost of half of my men. > Qatu motioned to the rest of his pitiful force. There were less than a hundred goblins and hobgoblins left, all injured and shambling in some way or another. < If you don’t mind, I need to take a rest… >

< Of course, of course! > Bresir quickly made way for them, allowing the force to enter through the wide-open wooden gates. Bresir observed the condition of the force as they walked past them.

*How terrifying is the human force to inflict this much damage onto our armoured strike force? I must report this to Osir once he exits the palace…* Bresir’s train of thought was suddenly stopped as a fairly tall hobgoblin walked past him, completely covered in armour with its face masked by a leaf bandage.

Bresir considered himself one of the tallest hobgoblins around, and he had been managing the army and rebel soldiers under Osir for a long time. *Strange, I don’t recall a hobgoblin being an entire head taller than me.* 

On the periphery of his vision, he noticed that a few of the hobgoblins were also just as tall, and one was extremely lanky and slim, almost feminine. *I also do not remember sending a female hobgoblin off with Qatu…*

The more he observed, the stranger he felt. However, most of the suspicion passed as soon as he saw the fifty baskets of food. *It does not matter as long as we have enough food to feed the people!*

Gulak was tied onto a pole and hoisted by two hobgoblins. Bresir grinned as he marched up to the bound shaman. < Gulak! Finally, karma has caught up to you! Today, before you are executed, you shall see what your selfish actions have caused to our people! >

Gulak scoffed: < You mean your people! The tributes I paid were extortionate! If your people cannot survive without my hunting or forage, perhaps your people are the ones who should not exist! Do not think that just because Osir is king that every goblin will listen to you! >

The arrogance and hostility stemming from Gulak made Bresir even more suspicious. < Soldiers! Put down the baskets of food and check them one by one! >

Bresir himself walked through the rows of baskets placed in order, opening them and checking them. Most of them were human goods and food, with dried meat and nuts being the majority. Bresir could not find any evidence that there was a human or even an enemy goblin hiding among the baskets. *If they are not hiding in the baskets…*

Just as the realisation hit him, two large human hands grabbed him by the head and twisted it sharply, his vision spinning 180 degrees rapidly as he glanced at Kyle’s face, no longer masked by the leaf bandage. As Bresir’s body slumped onto the floor, he could only see Kyle grab an arctech radio, speaking into it with the calm of a coming storm.

“We’re in. Commence the assault.”

MG404: [Stats Table]
# Chapter 67 - Saviour

MG404: [System Message | Killed: [Goblin General Bresir] | +500 EXP]

“Clean up the guards.” Kyle motioned with his hands, the trojan force under him immediately lashing out in a surprise attack, each of his soldiers lunging out with hidden weapons. Whatever feigned injuries or bandages they had were now thrown aside as they charged.

The guards were caught unaware, the prior excitement of victory and finally having enough food to eat was replaced with horror and confusion as they tried to retreat from the two hundred strong force that now rushed towards them.

“Sasha, don’t let any of them escape!” Kyle ordered, planning to secure the gate without the rest of Osir’s forces finding out.

Sasha nodded, swinging a longsword with both arms as she hacked with abandoned at goblin after goblin. The longsword cleaved through the dense muscles and bone of the guards, lodging itself halfway as she kicked the bleeding victim away, pulling her longsword out with frightening brutality. The retreating guards soon saw through the disguise, some of them recognizing her just from the movements alone.

< It’s the female human monster! Run! >

< No, we need to regroup and fight back! If we lose the- >

The guard’s head was grabbed from behind as Sasha’s right fist glowed bright, the force of the longsword’s swing boosted. The cold edge of the blade seared through the vocal cords and windpipes of the unfortunate guard, Sasha continuously tugging and sawing away like a butcher. With a final lurch, the guard’s head came cleanly off, tendrils of flesh and meat dripping from what was his neck.

Instead of reveling in the violence, Sasha did this with a clear intention: to get the guards to surrender. Moving quickly to her next target, she was instantly grouped up on by a few courageous souls. She parried a hit from a brave fighter before pushing back, taking advantage of the confusion and disorganization among the guards to slaughter her way through the fearful guards more than a dozen in ten minutes.

Kyle focused on securing the gate, flushing the remaining guards stationed on the walls. Javelins were thrown at them, while Kyle easily dodged them and sprinted up the stone steps to reach the top. The paltry metal shields of the guards were dented and smashed in easily by Kyle’s kicks and neon-red hammer strikes, with others felled by the pellets shot from his handgun.

< Quick! Light the signal fire! > One of the guards yelled to a wooden watchtower, but what replied to him instead was a loud bang followed by the falling body of the observer stationed above, shot in the chest.

Kyle aimed his handgun at the watchtowers, ensuring no goblin observer could send back any signal to the main rebel army. If the rebel army caught wind of the attack, he could not guarantee that his forces would be able to fight head-on against a thousand goblin warriors. *Even if I could, it would be such a waste of manpower.*

As the battle was concluded, a secondary attack force under Kyle’s command entered through the gates, trailing behind the initial trojan force. In total, Kyle now had two hundred and fifty warriors under him, ready to strike.

The warriors gathered the bodies of the guards and piled them up, along with the corpse of Bresir. Gulak was untied, grinning widely as he danced in front of the corpses of the guards. “Arrogant hobgoblin, I spit on your body!”

A few guards were kept alive and interrogated by Kyle and Gulak. This allowed them to understand the overall situation in the area now while Kyle pondered his next move.

[We should rally with the other local pockets of resistance fighting for the former king.] Sasha pointed out. [We can tap into their manpower and gain some legitimacy, otherwise, we will be fighting against both sides who want to resist human control.]

“Where is the former king now?” Kyle asked Gulak.

“Sahusa the Great’s palace.” Gulak pointed to a large section of the valley’s slope above the treeline, where it seems that a few significant structures have been built, embedded into the wall directly overlooking the valley. “Guards say he last seen with Osir inside, has been one cycle.”

“Not all the six tribes are here, correct?”

“Yes, this is home of Steel Song Tribe. Osir’s main tribe is Howling Wind, far away.”

Kyle frowned. “This means that there’s a chance that there will be additional forces trying to enter the valley from this direction.” With the other tribes having their own armies beyond the valley, it was even more important to hold the gate to ensure fewer variables.

“Sasha, you will remain here in charge. Hold the gate until I have saved the former king.”

[Yes, sir.]

Kyle grabbed a few health potions from a supply crate, stuffing the small vials into his belt alongside his magazines before he sprinted off towards the palace alone.

He used the dense forest as cover, keeping off the crude gravel roads and instead running towards the slope of the valley up towards the embedded buildings. Surprisingly, there were nearly no guards outside the palace, with every available rebel soldier fighting against the loyal knights elsewhere all along the entire length of the valley. *Makes it easier for me.*

Silently striding into the vicinity of the palace, he was amazed by the seemingly man-made formation that the palace was carved into. It seemed to be a perfect square that was tunnelled out of the side of the mountain, leading deeper into the formation. Large stone pillars supported the weight of the ceiling to prevent it from collapsing, with centuries of immaculate drawings lined on the surface.

Kyle gave the drawings a cursory glance, noting the long history of the goblins and how long they had been here. *Based on the drawings, it seems like they have been here for a good five hundred years or so, but I’m not an expert.* If anything, he was only an expert at selling such archaeological finds on the black market, having dug up countless alien ruins in the Galactic Era. He focused on finding the former king for now – there would be time to solve all of it.

He soon reached the palace’s entrance plaza, finally noticing two hobgoblin guards patrolling the large archway that led further into the foyer. Kyle hid himself behind a stone pillar, taking out his arctech handgun and checking his ammo. *Fifty rounds total.*

Kyle peeked his head out, examining the guards who carried a sword and a round shield. He noticed that their armor was far more elaborate and intricate than the guards and strike force that he found. He could even see signs of arctech engravings on the surface of their vambrace, though it was too far for him to determine what effects they would have.

Taking a deep breath, Kyle stepped out from the pillar, immediately firing his handgun at the two guards.

The vambraces of the two guards flared to life, firing out point defense projectiles to cancel out the incoming shots while they yelped as they were caught off-guard. < Human?! >

They lifted the round shield and entered a fighting stance as Kyle sprinted towards them, closing the gap. The guards rushed forward bravely, with the first guard taking point and slashing downwards at Kyle in an aggressive attempt.

He dodged to the side before using his left free hand to grab the wrist of the guard, pivoting and delivering a knee to the back of the guard, denting the armour in and cracking the guard’s spine. Kyle immediately retreated backwards, creating distance as the second guard stabbed towards him with ferocity. With deft movements, Kyle swiftly aimed the handgun and fired two more shots at the second guard.

To his surprise, the arctech vambrace blocked the shots again, while the first guard’s breastplate activated to produce a healing effect, allowing him to recover back into a fighting posture. “Fine, let’s do it the hard way.” Kyle sheathed his handgun and brandished his neon red hammer, charging straight at them.

The two guards were synchronised, each covering for their own openings while blocking attacks with the shields. However, they were still no match for the brute force strength of Kyle’s hammer strike, slamming down right onto the shield and causing the first guard’s knees to buckle to the floor, losing balance as he toppled.

With a backhand swing as a follow-up, Kyle parried the second guard’s sword and sent it flying out of its grip before continuing with a devastating combo that saw Kyle brutally target each of their vitals, their skulls crushed in. The delayed activation of the second impact further squashed their brains in, a sickening squish echoing in the now silent palace’s entrance plaza

MG404: [System Message | Killed: [Improved Hobgoblin Guard] | +250 EXP]

*Improved Hobgoblin?* Kyle was a bit taken aback, having never seen an improved hobgoblin before. None of the hobgoblins he killed from Leader Qatu had such a title for them.

He entered the palace, which was a complete mess. Dozens of goblin and hobgoblin corpses were strewn over smashed furniture and cracked marble floor tiles, the blood already dried over a day. Kyle stepped warily into the entrance lobby, keeping an eye for any ambushers.

To his surprise, there were no guards anywhere in the lobby; only the ambience of death and silence accompanied Kyle as he watched his step. As he approached the grand staircase, he could hear footsteps walking down the marble tiles, prompting him to hide behind one of the pillars nearby.

A lone hobgoblin guard was patrolling the palace, equipped with the same equipment as the guards Kyle killed. Kyle stealthily crept around, waiting until the guard passed the pillar before jumping out and grappling him to the ground, quickly forcing the guard to drop his sword and shield.

< Talk-Where King? > Kyle spoke in a broken goblin language, unable to fully imitate the guttural sounds as he pinned the guard down.

< The human speaks?! > The hobgoblin was surprised, earning a smack to the back of the head.

< Talk! >

The hobgoblin tried to flip Kyle over, but to no avail, as Kyle expertly restricted all of his limbs’ movement. < No, you filthy human! I am a proud warrior of the Howling Win- > Another smack.

< Talk >

< You think just smacking me is going to- > Smack.

Kyle smacked him a few more times before he finally relented.

< Wait, stop smacking! I’ll tell you, just let me go! >

< No I won’t. You come with me. > Kyle used his hammer and broke the limbs of the hobgoblin at the joints, the screams muffled as Kyle forced its head into the ground. < You don’t need this. > Kyle grabbed the breastplate and destroyed the engraving on it, preventing the hobgoblin from healing.

The hobgoblin whimpered as Kyle lifted him up, grabbing him like a hostage shield in front of his body, except for the clearly twisted and broken limbs of the hobgoblin dangling. < Bring me to enemy – you die. Slowly. Understand? >

The hobgoblin nodded vigorously through teary eyes.

< Point with your nose. >

Just like this, Kyle used the crippled hobgoblin as a guide who was unable to fight back thanks to the broken limbs. He navigated the myriad of hallways and rooms filled with dead servants and other family members of the king, quickly moving.

Soon, he was led to a hallway where there were two more guards protecting a jail door. In a split instant, Kyle flung the crippled guide towards the two guards, the body smacking into the first guard while Kyle sprinted along the side, lunging at the second with a strong hammer strike uppercut right into the chin.

MG404: [System Message | Killed: [Improved Hobgoblin Guard] |+250 EXP]

He made quick work of the other guard as well, keeping the crippled guide alive, who was agonising from the impact of the throw. Kyle aimed his hammer at the hinges of the prison door, smacking it repeatedly till it was damaged and fell to the ground with a loud clanging thud, revealing a badly bruised goblin who was stark naked.

It was clear he had been repeatedly tortured, though a sense of determination still held strong in his posture.

< You. King? >

Sahusa the Great could barely see through his swollen eyelids, but he made out the outline of the human. < No, I am no longer king… the King is Osir… >

< Good. > Kyle grabbed the crippled guide and dragged him into the prison cell, tossing him into a corner. Retrieving a health potion vial from his belt, he fed it to Sahusa, healing him slightly just enough to talk.

“Who… who are you?” Sahusa spoke as he tried to sit up, wincing at the bruises sending jolts of pain through his nerves. “Are you with Gulak?”

“A smart king. I need you to get your people back under control. I will help you squash the rebellion.”

Sahusa was nearly overjoyed to hear it, but he soon calmed himself down, thinking quickly about why Kyle was offering such a deal. It wouldn’t be the first time that he was offered something too good to be true, and remained quiet as he contemplated. “You want me to serve as your puppet.”

“Your society is unable to support your population without agricultural development. I assume this is not the first time such a rebellion has happened.”

Sahusa didn’t reply immediately, but internally he knew Kyle was right. The growth of the population was always limited by the ecosystem as they could only hunt and forage, with no knowledge of large-scale farming. There had been a few attempts, but the scale was just not big enough to sustain such a centralization development as his forefathers had attempted.

“Do you not want to see a golden era of goblins? One living in prosperity and happiness? I can make it happen – as long as you help me as well.” Kyle pressed his offer.

Sahusa sighed, knowing the only other option he had was to let Osir take control, beginning the cycle anew into a never-ending spiral of continuous coups and revolts. Perhaps Kyle represented a way out of this never-ending loop, a pathway to a better kingdom. However, what would he have to sacrifice? Was he trading one enemy for another?

Yet he had no choice if he wanted to live. He certainly did not trust Osir to lead his people into greatness, and so he had to settle for the lesser unknown evil for now.

“Fine, I agree. However, I am not a king anymore – it is Osir.”

“I know. Where is he? They told me he would be in the palace.”

“No, he is not. He is currently trying to brute force his way into getting an audience with the Oracle.”

“The Oracle?”
# Chapter 68 - Evolution

“The Oracle has been with us since the beginning of time,” Sahusa explained as he put on the dead hobgoblin guards’ gear, having healed up to full with another of Kyle’s health potions. “But Osir is no easy foe; he is one of the strongest hobgoblins there is, which is how he maintains his position as leader of the Howling Wind Tribe. In order to defeat him-“

< Hey! What happened here? > Another group of patrolling guards spotted Sahusa and Kyle in the open, prompting Kyle to charge them without hesitation, easily dodging their swords and killing them with multiple strikes to the head and body. Kyle could read their attack patterns like an open book, knowing that all of them were probably trained the same way.

“Where is the Oracle?” Kyle wiped the blood splatter off his cheek, walking back to Sahusa without a sweat. The former Goblin King gulped internally as he watched Kyle approach him, his mind slowly comprehending how strong Kyle was.

“I need to go the armoury to pick up my armour set first,” Sahusa explained. “This way, I can also assist you… a little.”

“Fine by me.” Kyle nodded. He wouldn’t say no to some more arctech armour. Perhaps he would find something that could help him even more.

Kyle finished off the crippled guide in the prison in one clean swing, tying up loose ends and moving quickly through the palace with Sahusa as the guide. Sahusa was half-expecting Kyle to meet up with another group of humans, but as they neared the armoury, he did not see any others there. *Weird, did he enter the palace alone?*

The armoury was unprotected, its gilded rows and shelves of equipment noticeably barren. All of the weapons and equipment had already been taken and distributed among the rebel soldiers, pillaged to oblivion. Sahusa was crestfallen at the disappearance of his own armour set, one that represented what the King was. “Osir seems to have taken everything of worth in here.”

“Then you stay put here. Tell me the way to reach the Oracle.”

“No, I’ll go with you. I can handle my own.”

“No.” Kyle gripped Sahusa’s shoulder tightly, forcing him down onto the ground. “If you don’t stay here, I’ll tie you up. I can’t have you dying on me.” Kyle did not want a liability tagging along with him – the death of the former king would make it even harder to consolidate the area with legitimacy.

If Kyle could rule directly, he would not hesitate to decimate the entire royal bloodline. However, this would only create resentment among the surviving goblin population. In order to ease the transition of power, he needed a figurehead, one that can be accepted by the goblins.

Sahusa tried to get up in defiance, wanting to seek his own revenge against Osir. He grabbed Kyle’s wrist, exerting force in trying to pry it off his shoulder. However, he did not have enough strength to overpower Kyle even in such a simple scenario, Kyle’s grip firm. “Fine, I’ll stay hidden here. The Oracle stays in a grand cave far behind the palace. Simply head further into the mountain, and you will find it. I doubt Osir managed to make it past the entrance.”

Kyle nodded, barricading the armory with fallen debris to make sure they couldn’t easily reach the former king. He sprinted through the palace in a general direction, killing a few more hobgoblin guards along the way. The entire palace was a disaster, with dead servants, pillaged kitchens and storerooms. The centuries of decadence and wealth had been ruptured and ripped apart by equally ruthless rebels.

The construction of the palace seemed to follow the cavernous tunnel itself, stretching inwards deep into the mountains, yet every structural design seemed to be a maze in order to prevent anyone from reaching its end. However, Kyle’s job of navigation was made easier with the trail of rebel footprints and hobgoblin guards posted along the expected route.

He soon approached an elongated corridor resplendent with former luxury, the originally yellow carpet stained by the blood of a vicious battle, dead bodies piled up and oozing along the grooves of the hand-laid tiles. Up ahead laid an encompassing darkness, the natural cavern spreading further than his eyes could see save for a few lanterns placed sparsely along the floor, leading in.

Kyle took great precaution, scavenging for a shield from a fallen hobgoblin as protection. Such a cavern only served as a perfect line of sight for any ranged attacks. He wasn’t about to simply assume that the elite warriors of Osir had completely forgone bows and arrows, or even guns if they had them.

Each step he took echoed through the thunderous cavern, yet no attack seem to be imminent. The path was eerily silent, and there was a conspicuous dearth of bodies and corpses, as though no one had tread here before.

As he moved further in, he finally spotted a few bodies of hobgoblin warriors fallen onto the ground, their chests gouged out by a perfectly circular searing wound that went straight through their hearts, the edges of the gaping hole still smoldering. The cauterized flesh had been blackened, the missing parts turned to ash.

Kyle immediately recognized the type of wound, having seen it far too often in the Galactic Era. *Particle beam guns? They exist here?*

He was not too surprised at the fact that Galactic Era technology was present in this world. He had already seen an ancient exosuit spine as well as a personal energy shield from the Ilysian Punks. But he did not expect such technology to be hidden under the primitive goblins.

Kyle had been trying to pin down the history behind the world that he was in and how he had awoken here. Plenty of theories swarmed in his head, but the existence of the particle guns forced him to reconsider the validity of most of them.

More and more goblin corpses were appearing with increasing frequency as he continued to move down, their faces still frozen in agony and surprise. The row of corpses numbered in the dozens, leading up to a large broken metallic door, a gaping hole evident in the very middle as though someone had clawed it out with their own hands. Dangling wires hanging out of destroyed mechanical turret stands stood testament to the brutal fight here. *A massacre.*

The door was recognizable of Galactic Era technology, the hinges and composite metal armor clearly manufactured under immense heat and pressure that was hardly achievable in Raktor. Yet Kyle could see a few signs that it was not the same level of technology, the material makeup of the armour far more advanced that what he had possessed in his former life.

The Galactic Era did not imply that every single sector in the galaxy had the same level of technology, with the time taken to perform FTL travel from the center of the galaxy to the rim being more than ten years. This led to the stunted growth of technology in the sectors on the outskirts, which was where Kyle’s criminal empire used to thrive, far away from the reaches of the Council at the center of the human quadrant.

As such, technology grades in the Galactic Era were split between ‘classes,’ with Kyle’s previous domain being C-Class. The difference in exotic material concentration also inhibited technology adoption – even if a C-Class force knew how to make a B-Class technology, it did not mean that they had the materials to do so.

The turrets and door were of A-Class technology, two grades above what Kyle knew. The door was also far too big to be an entry point of a crashed ship, and he highly doubted that a capital ship this size would not have made any obvious landmark to the natives.

Yet for an A-Class metal composite armor to be successfully broken by the goblin army meant that it had weakened over the years. Kyle walked up to the door carefully, inspecting the damage dealt. Instead of seeing a perfectly arranged multi-layered armour cutaway, it instead looked like a amalgamation of bacteria and slush, as though it was the innards of an alien hive.

*The door had already been previously attacked by a metal nano-plague in the past…*

Kyle did not waste anymore time surveying, knowing he had to stop Osir as soon as possible. Every hour he delayed was another hour where they spent more money than was necessary on iron and coal. He entered the doors, noticing a large lab-like hallway, except the walls were dark blue and the ceiling was immeasurably high. It felt more like a temple of sorts, with a single delineated path running down through the middle.

Countless bodies of robotic turrets were smashed and broken apart, some entangled with dead hobgoblins who fought to the end, using their bodies to bear the brunt of the damage, pockmarked with particle beam wounds.  It was clear that Osir had forced his way in with his forces, utilising the king’s armoury to its limit.

MG404: [System ALERT | UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS | %@&#*( ARE N&T ALL*WED IN. SY*@#M WILL BE DEACTI@3TED IN T@)#TY SECONDS. PLEASE L333E44AVE THE AR@&#EA]

MG404: [System Message | UPLINK ERROR | U12812 TO CONN123 TO  M2IN SE213R.]

MG404: [Adminstrator Access | Access Granted | Secret Key Accepted. Welcome to Installation 12.]

*Installation 12?* Kyle became even more curious. He had never had a system message for entering a new area before, not even when he entered the Culdao Peaks area or different parts of Raktor.

For the System to react like this to such an area, it seems like it could hold the answers as to what exactly is Kyle's holographic system interface.

He picked up the pace, moving through the large hallway. However, he immediately spotted something that forced him to stop and deviate, running towards the wall.

Kyle leaned down next to a deformed skeleton with two horns jutting out of its skull. However, it was wearing a wholly destroyed exosuit, the particle beam rifle in its hand entirely shattered by what seemed to be a bullet.

It was not the only monster skeleton piled up along the side, with multiple different types of skeletons of varying shapes, sizes, and forms. Only a few were actually human, and they bore a different type of exosuit compared to the monster skeletons.

Kyle was not an expert in determining the time of death, but for the exosuit to have decayed this badly over time indicated it could have been more than a few hundred years, less if he considered the effects of the metal nano-plague. The time scale gave his heart a sinking feeling, the possibility that whatever he knew of the Galactic Era could have been long gone by now.

He tried to salvage some equipment, yet there was not much still functioning. Most of the exosuits that laid about had already been ravaged to a shadow of their former glory, the metal nano-plague pervasive. Yet there was a conscpicous lack of rifles and weaponry, as though someone had taken all of it. *This is bad.*

Kyle decided not to move ahead any further, quickly salvaging as much as he could find, hoping that the hobgoblins did not take everything. Soon, his keen eyes managed to find a working personal energy shield that somehow was not affected by the metal nano-plague, though the battery strength was degraded over time. Picking up the palm-sized energy shield module, the system surprisingly did not give him any indication of what the item was and its statistics, as though his system no longer functioned within the installation. *Weird; it’s getting even weirder now…*

The personal energy shield beeped while Kyle held it in his hands, displaying a holographic message. [Warning: 10% charge left. Proceed to the nearest employee charging station.]

It was far from ideal, but Kyle did not complain too much, equipping the personal energy shield to his body. The module latched itself onto its back, scanning his body’s outline before generating a skin-layer forcefield around his body that shimmered under the dim glow of the floorlights. *This should be good enough unless I have to fight the automated defense turrets.*

As he continued on, he found the entire situation simply ironic. He had spent the majority of his criminal empire attempting to hustle for highly controlled B-Class technology, yet here he was, wearing an A-class personal energy shield by simply scavenging.

He soon approached the end of the hallway, noticing a thick rusted bolted door as the only exit, pneumatic pistons stretching into the recesses of the walls. Before Kyle could even consider how he was going to open it, a large hissing sound was heard as the pneumatic doors on the end opened to reveal five hobgoblin guards exiting the hallway.

< Do you feel stronger? I feel like I can crush anything with my fist now! >

< That green smoke – it is a blessing from the Oracle! No doubt with our comrades improving their strength, we can strike back against Gulak and the humans! >

Kyle noted that they still had their weapons sheathed, taking advantage of surprise to rush at the hobgoblins, firing his entire arctech handgun clip at two of them, overwhelming the point defense armour engravings, killing them instantly as green arcia bolts lanced across the wide hallway, attempting to shoot down Kyle’s pellets.

< What?! Intruder! Go back and warn Osir that the humans are here! > One of them roared, but none of them had the time to react as Kyle charged them down, closing the gap in four short leaps and pummeling the hobgoblin.

< Fool! I have the power of the Oracle behind me no- > The hobgoblin roared just as Kyle sank his fist into its face, crushing the entire skull in one fell swoop. A sword swing came in too fast for Kyle to react to, causing the A-class personal energy shield to flare up and deflect the sword.

[Warning: 5% left. Proceed to the nearest employee charging station immediately.]

*Their attack pattern is the same, but its much faster.* Kyle grunted as he swiveled to grab the attacking hobgoblin by the neck, snapping it with his grip and flinging him aside as the third hobgoblin stabbed towards him, forcing him to dodge and take a step back before speed reloading his handgun.

The final hobgoblin fell, the point defense vambrace unable to react at such close range. Kyle noticed that there weren’t any system messages for him killing the hobgoblin as well.

Determined now to find out the truth, he headed past the open pneumatic doors, entering a large circular chamber where a lone hobgoblin decked in golden armour was in the middle, surrounded by numbered doors all along the circumference. Each of the doors had a countdown clock over them, with thirty seconds left.

The hobgoblin was the largest he had seen yet, towering at nearly 2.4 meters in height. It roared as it slammed the command console in front of it, the orange holographic interface illuminating his green muscles.

< Oracle, why do you not answer me! What is the truth behind this place?! Where did this power come from? > The large hobgoblin roared to the console.

[Error: Voice Pattern not recognised. Please repeat the question. Note: Due to the destruction of defensive systems, following Protocol 138A, all relevant data has been erased from the databanks.]

< GAH! I TIRE OF YOUR NONSENSE, ORACLE! If you are unwilling to tell me the truth, then you have no more purpose! > The large hobgoblin gripped the command console, ripping it off its stands and the connected wires, causing it to fray as the console was tossed to the side, its monitors and keys smashed to pieces.

< This… I know what this place is—a relic from the Heavenly War by our forefathers. To think we had so much heritage, so much untapped potential hidden within our bodies! How dare Sahusa and his tribe hide such information from the people! >

The large hobgoblin glanced at Kyle entering the chamber, his eyes widening. < HUMAN! You defile the holy chambers of our ancestors! >

“I take it that you’re Osir.” Kyle brandished his handgun, aiming it right at Osir and firing three shots. Instead of hitting Osir, a shimmering personal energy shield on Osir glowed purple, blocking the shots and dissipating them.

Osir barely flinched, instead glancing towards the countdown clock and grinning < Fool, you are no match for our improved potential! > The doors around the chambers hissed as residual green gas began to waft out, with nearly two dozen hobgoblins stepping out of their individual chambers, all clearly improved hobgoblins armed with a sword and shields.

< Human – today, you die here! >
# Chapter 69 - Warlord

Kyle did not stand around in the open circular chamber, immediately retreating to the entrance. He fired the remainder of his magazine at the two closest hobgoblins, overwhelming their point defence systems. The undeflected pellets tore right through the skin and muscles, some nailing their target right in the head and killing them on the spot.

His hand instinctively grabbed a magazine of pellets to reload the handgun, his fingers swiping past the remainder of his belt to keep stock. *Only two more magazines left after this one – thjrty-six shots left, including my current magazine.*

Instead of exposing himself to attacks from all sides, he funnelled them into the tight, narrow space of the rusted pneumatic doors, bending over to grab a shield into his left shield from the earlier hobgoblin guards he killed.

The first three hobgoblins charged through the gap, earning themselves a full frontal strike of the shield right onto their faces, sending them stumbling back into their allies who crowded around behind them.

< Coward! Come out to the chamber and fight like a warrior! > Osir roared.

Kyle ignored the obvious taunt and swapped to close-quarters combat, changing out his handgun for the hammer and going to town on the closest hobgoblins. He swung and smashed, using the shield on his left hand to fend off the sword attacks as well as break their necks with a forward jab of the shield’s edge.

*Penchant for Violence!*

The same familiar surge of energy flowed through the veins of Kyle’s body, granting him an increase in strength, allowing him to easily dispatch the incoming hobgoblins as he fought them three at a time. Despite their obviously improved physique, none of the improved hobgoblins were a match for his sheer strength and fast reflexes, unless they fought him from all angles.

Osir recognized this issue immediately. < Idiots! Push past the choke point and surround him! > Osir roared, prompting the hobgoblins to charge forward with even more vigour, using the fallen bodies of their comrades to try and block the attacks of Kyle.

“No chance.” Kyle grinned as he expertly focused on any hobgoblin trying to get past him. At some point, he dropped the hammer and grabbed the ankle of an injured hobgoblin, using him as a weapon by wildly swinging him around.

With a single swing of the hobgoblin’s body, the ankle bone snapped off cleanly as Kyle launched the body towards the hobgoblins, knocking them out like dominos back into the circular chamber. Osir was astonished by the sheer strength of the human, only recalling the line infantry of the arrogant Kregol Count that they had fought in the past. *Since when were humans this competent? I must capture him alive and find out his secrets!*

Already half of them had died, leaving only a dozen hobgoblins alive and afraid to re-enter the death trap of the entrance, where Kyle stood over the corpses of their comrades, drenched in goblin blood.

*Penchant for Violence only lasts for a while; I need to make the best use of it right now!* Kyle did not wait for them to muster up the courage to come back in and fight, instead using his handgun to fire at the hobgoblins, taking them out one at a time.

With precise calculations on how much their point defence system could block, it took four shots to kill one of them, prompting Kyle to finish off three of them with rapid fire as he sprinted around the circumference of the chamber.

Just as Kyle began to reload his magazine while running, his brain screamed danger as a hail of brilliant particle beams flew straight at him. The speed of the beam made it impossible for Kyle to avoid the hits, his skin-layer personal energy shield wobbling violently before it dissipated into nothingness.

The remainder of the particle beams seared through the skin and flesh of Kyle’s right arm and thigh, penetrating all the way through and carving a smoldering wound out while Kyle gritted his teeth, resisting the urge to scream.

[WARNING: BATTERY DEPLETED!]

The personal energy shield warned as Kyle fumbled onto the floor, blood cauterising on the still sizzling wound while his handgun and shield clattered onto the floor. The remaining hobgoblins began to rush Kyle while Osir held a smoking turret gun in both hands, astonished by the existence of the personal energy shield on Kyle.

< This human knows how to use the Heavenly Relics as well! > Osir exclaimed. < Cut off his limbs and capture him! >

But before the hobgoblins could move any further, an all-encompassing feeling of dread fell over the hobgoblins and even Osir himself, his heart palpitating slightly as his neck broke out in cold sweat. Osir had never felt this way for a long time – the last being his first trial hunting a sabretooth in the ravine near his home tribe.

*Intimidation Aura!*

Kyle stood up quickly, wincing at the pain while he used his undamaged arm to grab the health potion vials, stuffing them into his mouth and activating the necklace of healing as well. A bright green surge healed Kyle back nearly instantaneously, the particle beam wounds instantly shedding their burnt flesh and regenerating, but he knew this would be the last full healing he would get for a while.

The effects of the Penchant for Violence began to taper off, but the Intimidation Aura allowed Kyle to buy time to pick up his handgun and reload.

Osir was the first to snap out of it, squeezing the trigger on the turret gun. However, the energy battery had clearly been depleted, and only smoke and sparks were ignited along the frame of the turret gun, causing it to malfunction. Instead of hesitating, Osir tossed the gun with a loud roar towards Kyle, forcing Kyle to leap out of the way.

Kyle immediately emptied his clip into the next three hobgoblins, nailing them while they were still frozen to the ground by the intimidating aura still emitting from Kyle. The sight of their comrades falling to the ground amplified the fear they felt in their hearts, prompting the remaining six hobgoblins to scamper out of the entrance, afraid of fighting against Kyle any longer.

Osir did not bother with them, knowing nothing he did now would be able to bring them back. < Useless warriors! The Oracle’s Blessing is wasted on them! > He cracked his hands as he marched towards Kyle, who reloaded his handgun and fired the entire clip at Osir.

The projectiles were all deflected by the personal energy shield, with Osir completely unfazed. < Fool! The Goblin King’s armour is no match for your puny pistol! > With a loud battle cry, Osir charged forward in a tackle with unexpected speed, slamming right into Kyle with his right armoured elbow and pinning him into the wall with his sheer body strength, being nearly one and a half times larger than Kyle.

Kyle gagged as the destructive impact ran through his body, his guts shuddering as Osir’s humongous left hand grabbed Kyle by the neck, lifting him with ease before being thrown headfirst onto the floor, the metallic tiles cracking at the seams in a spiderweb.

The force nearly knocked Kyle out,  but his combat training kicked in, his body instinctively rolling out of the way to dodge an incoming stomp by Osir.

*Aero Shoes!*

Kyle’s shoes glowed brightly, accelerating him even faster as he circled Osir, grabbing his hammer and picking up yet another shield. His eyes darted across the room as he analyzed every opening and opportunity he could exploit. He was no stranger to fighting larger humanoid aliens, having fought countless slovesas in the liberation wars of his home nation.

Osir felt a slight tingle run down his spine as the analytical eyes of Kyle sized him up like prey to be chopped up, making him wonder who was the real predator here. However, there was no time to hesitate – only the battle mattered.

As soon as Osir made the first step, Kyle sprinted towards Osir, swinging the hammer at the extended leg that was stepping forward. But before he could complete the swing, his instincts prompted him to retract his arm and support his shield with both arms as Osir immediately countered with a backhand swing, sending Kyle flying across the chamber.

Kyle twisted his body and negated the force through his recovery landing, instantly dashing out of the way as a broken command console came hurtling towards him, smashing into the wall in a burst of sparks and metal. The fragments pelted Kyle’s face, impeding his vision temporarily as he continued to run.

Before Kyle could shake them off his face, Osir was already a step ahead of him, lunging towards him. Kyle’s eyes glinted as he spotted an opening, pivoting on his right foot and side-stepping the heavy punch coming in. With two rapid strikes to the waist of Osir, Kyle immediately retreated until another opening appeared, stepping in again to counterattack.

Osir grinned as he prepared to fight back, but suddenly, the two points on which he had been struck flared up with a severe jabbing pain, causing him to flinch involuntarily. With his movement temporarily hampered, Kyle took the chance and delivered a brutal combo, landing five strikes directly onto Osir’s right forearm.

The delayed pain retook effect, neutralising Osir’s right arm for a short moment, allowing Kyle to continue the devastating series of strikes, continuously swapping over to the other side. Kyle’s brain raced as he mentally calculated the time taken for the pain to kick in, timing it with his follow-up attacks to prevent Osir from retaliating effectively.

< ENOUGH! > Osir bellowed, his warlike blood and animalistic instincts pounding non-stop, the adrenaline causing the effects of the hammer to become insignificant. Kyle was caught off-guard by Osir’s sudden cry, another heavy-handed slam hitting his shield. The vibration from the hit nearly caused Kyle to drop his hand as his bones were rattled from the sheer force.

Kyle immediately knew what was happening, quickly backing off and leaping from side to side, no longer interested in fighting back.

< COME HERE, YOU COWARD! > Osir heaved the bodies of his fallen warriors, using them as projectiles to force Kyle into dodging before charging forward. However, Kyle was far too nimble for Osir to catch up with, especially with the activation of the Aero Shoes.

The song and dance continued for another minute or so while the pain that Osir had been ignoring began to creep back slowly, the dull aching sensation in his body no longer able to be avoided. The very moment Kyle noticed Osir slowing down, he launched a vicious counterattack, rushing straight at Osir unexpectedly.

It was a simple tactic every frontier explorer of the Galactic Era learnt when dealing with native alien lifeforms – avoid when enraged, strike when weak. No sane explorer would fight an alien who should be braindead while the body is still unaware of its own death.

Just like that, Kyle held the unequivocal advantage over Osir, easily hitting all over the body. Osir yelled out in pain as the multitude of delayed pain effects kicked in at the same time, causing him to suffer tremendously.

< Eno…enough! You always had the power to kill me. Just finish me off! > Osir knew that Kyle had more than enough strength to beat him over the course of the fight. He would have given up and retreated if it wasn’t for the fact that this was a life-or-death duel. His head hung low, dejected as he slumped against the wall, unable to move his limbs any longer.

“Good.” Kyle took a deep breath, his head covered in sweat, grime and blood as he tried to wipe it off with an equally bloody hand. “I have a few questions. What is the Oracle?”

Osir was dumbfounded. < What?! But you… you know how to use the Heavenly Relics! >

“Answer the question.”

< The Oracle…. The Oracle is this room! The heritage of our forefathers who left it as a relic from the Heavenly War… >

“You keep talking about the heavenly war; what is it?”

< A.. a myth. > Osir spoke with a pained expression as he breathed deeply, his lungs aching. < Passed down from our ancestors. A continental war that caused the colour of the sky to change its hue. The stars blotted out by divine rays from above. Millions of our forefathers fought and died, leaving us with only this… > Osir coughed out blood, dripping down his chin.

“How long ago was this… heavenly war?” Kyle asked with hesitation, afraid to know the answer. He already had hints from the skeletons and rusted exosuits.

< I do not know, but… but the first Goblin King was five hundred years ago… > Osir’s voice started to get weaker. Kyle quickly moved forward to heal him with the Necklace of Healing, but for some reason, the green aura that enveloped Osir was not enough to fix the internal bleeding.

“What are the chambers for? What did the console tell you?”

“The Oracle, what did she tell you?”

< It spoke of an improvement, of … pro-to-cols… I only wished to see the glory of the goblin race, for our race to flourish once more… > Osir’s voice trailed off, the small amount of healing unable to stem the severe wounds Kyle had inflicted on Osir.

Kyle stopped trying, noticing Osir’s hands losing their tension. The chamber was a complete wreck, with many of the chamber doors smashed in or broken apart by their brutal fight. He stood up, glancing around the room. One of the doors out of the chamber looked different – an administrator room of sorts. As if on cue, the door began to automatically open.

MG404: [System Message | Access Granted | Temporary Administrator Privileges recognized. Please register at the nearest terminal.]

He readied his shield and hammer, preparing for the worst. *Time to find out what Installation 12 is.*
# Chapter 70 - Oracle

Kyle kept his guard up, staying wary as he stepped through the now-opened door of the administrator’s room. However, instead of seeing a control center of some sort, it was instead a long concrete hallway, dimly lit by barely functioning lights. *There is still electricity in the place – entirely possible for someone to be alive.*

He slowly stepped down the hallway, minimizing the noise of his footsteps as much as he could as he approached a T-junction. A sign in the Council’s language was plastered on the wall, further cementing Kyle’s belief that this was a Galactic Era installation.

[< --------------- Seed Storage | Genetic Chemicals ------------------- >]

*Seed Storage? Is this a doomsday bunker?* However, the existence of the green gaseous chambers that improved the hobgoblins did not seem right. It felt more like an experimental lab than a bunker meant to hide out. There were also no signs for shelter, so it did not feel like an evacuation point.

Kyle decided to check out the chemicals’ section first, curious about the green gas. He had breathed in a few whiffs but felt no particular changes to his body, wondering if it only affected goblins.

He soon reached another similar metallic door, locked tight. Unlike the previous doors, this one was seemingly well-preserved, with no sign of attack or any metal nano-plague corroding it from inside out. Kyle was considering his options on breaking the lock when the door automatically opened for him, as though it was expecting him. This raised his suspicion even higher as he tried to figure out why did he have such privilege.

*Is every System user an administrator? If there are such facilities in Versia, and Galactic Era tech was able to be recovered, perhaps they, too have a System User…*

Kyle focused his attention on his immediate surroundings. He stepped through the door, revealing a bio lab that was clearly dedicated to genetic experimentation. Hundreds of labelled pressurised gas tanks were lined up in a packed formation, the tubes attached to their nozzles and running the entire length of the lab’s ceiling towards an exit duct that no doubt led to the individual gas chambers.

There were four vats in the lab, each with a floating specimen inside. Kyle could see that they were arranged in ascending order, with a goblin baby being the first, followed by a goblin child, a goblin adult and a hobgoblin adult. They seemed to have been preserved in some sort of stasis, their cellular activity frozen in time.

*Were the goblins artificially created? Or experimented on?* Kyle moved over to the control terminal, where he spotted a helmetless human wearing an exosuit sitting on the chair, facing the vats. He readied himself for a fight, slowly moving up and using the hammer to spin the exosuit around slowly.

Only the dead, agonized, decaying face of its occupant stared back at Kyle, long dead before Kyle even arrived. Streaks of dried blood stains were marked on the wall, along with three other destroyed exosuits with no bodies. A pile of human bones lay in front of the exosuit pilot. *Cannibalism. Not surprised.*

He shoved the exosuit and bones out of the way, tapping the control panel. Nothing responded despite electricity still being supplied to this place. Kyle tried tapping once again, prompting a shimmering sound to materialize behind him. He quickly swiveled and swung the hammer, only for the hammer to pass through a holographic human.

[Good morning, Administrator. Oracle-13 ORISA at your service. What tasks would you like me to perform today?] The holographic AI human bowed, wearing a skimpy bikini that accentuated her curves in a disproportionate way. It instantly disgusted Kyle.

“Revert to your default form and give me the logs of the lab. And call me sir.”

[Understood.] The A.I. reverted into a military-style uniform, complete with a beret. [Following Protocol 138A, all existing logs and data have been purged from the facility. Shall I attempt to uplink to the main server?]

*Main Server?* “All future uplinks are hereby prohibited. Understood?”

“Yes, Administrator.”

“Refer to me as sir.”

The figure glitched temporarily, before returning to normalcy. “Yes, Administrator.”

Kyle didn’t press any further, immediately picking up on the error. *Seems like the cognitive core is damaged.*

He continued to scan the room, digging up any information possible. Many of the monitors have already been damaged, with only one intact, still functioning. He reached over to the monitor, tapping the nearly invisible frame with the tip of his fingers. It prompted a holographic keyboard to appear in the air, one that Kyle quickly typed in to try and access any remaining data. Yet the system had been wiped clean, with nothing left to investigate apart from a glowing “PROTOCOL 138A” in front of him.

“What is Protocol 138A?”

[I apologise. Information regarding Protocol 138A has also been erased.]

Kyle frowned, visibly frustrated as he tried again on the keyboard. However, facing such an issue was not unexpected. Many human forces in the Galactic Era employed such tactics to mask their military or secret installations. Galactic Coordinates were a life-or-death matter. It would be catastrophic if they were leaked to a hostile alien force. Kyle himself had employed such a protocol during his liberation war against the invading slovesa, preventing captured ships from leaking critical data.

“When was your last reboot?”

“68163748625”

“In human years.”

“Three hundred and seventy years ago.”

“When was Protocol 138A implemented?”

“Unknown.”

“So, you don’t know what this lab is for.”

[Correct. But I am connected to every mechanical and electrical system in this facility.]

“What defence systems are left?”

[Searching… ERROR: all defence systems have been neutralised.]

“What was your original purpose?”

[Sorry, I do not have the information to answer that.]

Kyle gripped his fist tightly, looking around for any question that he might have to try his luck. “What is this holographic interface that I have?”

[Sorry, I do not understand the question. I do not sense any holographic interface present on you.]

Kyle groaned. “What information do you actually have?”

[I have been equipped with many of the instructions needed to grow the seeds stored in the Seed Storage section. I am also able to control the pressure of the gas tanks that are currently connected to the individual chambers.]

Kyle sighed. If the A.I. had continued to be useless, he might have stormed the entire place to find her databank and rebooted it in the most manual way possible. “That’s it?”

[Apologies. All other records have been eradicated. There are two remaining pieces of data that I have retained, however.]

“Show me.”

[The first is an instruction to download data from the main server. Shall I execute?]

“NO!” Kyle shouted hurriedly. He had no idea what forces were behind the planet or controlling any installation. There would be severe repercussions if the force behind the main server found out that he had taken down one of their facilities. If Kyle were in that position, he would have also done the same thing.

“Under no circumstances are you to make any radio transmissions, electrical connection, or conversation with anyone outside this facility except me. Got it?”

[Yes, sir.]

Kyle pushed the dead exosuit wearer out of the chair, sitting down on it to rest. *This is actually a blessing in disguise, but I must find a way to hide the existence of the A. I as much as possible. Spreading the word about such a facility among the common people is a good way to invite trouble.*

He glanced at the A.I., who was still in a holographic form. “You mention another piece of information, what is it?”

[While my functionality is currently limited, I am able to restore my original form via repair of a few critical systems. Upon reboot I have noted all damaged systems and their required components]

A list of items appeared in front of Kyle, detailing the extent of the damage. Kyle’s eyes darted as he scanned through the list, most of which were clearly nanotech that he did not have the means to acquire nor produce. However, most of the damaged modules were not that important to him, especially anything to do with communications. It was better if he left it unrepaired to prevent virtual incursions.

One of the module’s name intrigued him, however. “Physical Transfer Module?”

[A module that allows me to upload a copy into a pre-prepared physical biological body.]

Kyle had never seen an A.I adopt a biological organism before, most of the time it being fully synthetic like a robot. *Why does the A.I in such a location have this functionality though?* “You must have records of using such a body before.”

[No, but I have retained the instruction on how to create a physical avatar.]

Kyle quickly started planning in his head. With the help of this supposed A.I. avatar, it could accelerate the redevelopment of the entire goblin society by centuries. All he had to do was to find some way to get the avatar to be somewhat functional, and then integrate it into the goblin society as a sort of ‘leader’.

Now with Osir dead, Sahusa would be a puppet under him, essentially giving Kyle full control of the goblin society within the Culdao Peaks. This alone would skyrocket his industrial capabilities beyond what any of his competitors could do, even the Ardent Cretins.

*Step-by-step.* Kyle had to stabilize the kingdom first in order to get the workforce going. Knowing that the source of the instability in the first place was due to famine, food was the highest priority that he needed to solve.

“Show me to the Seed Storage.”

Kyle crossed the hallway in which he entered from, heading to the opposite end where the pneumatic doors unlocked to reveal a broken radiation shower, meant to sterilize germs and bacteria that could infect the seeds.

Rows upon rows of shelves with cryogenically frozen seeds in pods stretched onwards infinitely, while ancient packing drones whirred to life, scaling the infinite shelves along the rims and resuming their indexing task. The A.I floated above him in a holographic projection, following him. [What seeds are you looking for?]

He peered into a few of the nearest pods, noticing a wide variety of genetic modification for all types of plants: Ancient Earth, New Terra and multiple new strains from conquered alien worlds. These collection reminded Kyle of one of the largest coroporations in the Galactic Era: terraformers, paid for decades-long projects to make worlds habitable again.

*So was this a terraforming outpost…?* *But why experiment on goblins?* Kyle did not question more, instead focusing on which seeds he needed in the immediate term. “Fastest growing cycle with the largest portion of nutrients and calories, with a slight emphasis on good flavour.”

[Calculating… Type-349-AGW, modified radish with growth cycle of 14 days, leaves are edible as well with a slight spice to it.]

“How many in storage?”

[Approximately 2,000,000 seeds.]

“Good. Have all of them unfrozen and delivered to the front entrance. I will be back soon.”

@@@

Sahusa was panicking as he continued to hide in the armoury, worried about what happened to Kyle. He had not heard a single warrior past the armoury ever since, but Kyle not returning after a few hours worried him tremendously.

Suddenly, two pairs of footsteps could be heard approaching the barricaded door of the armoury. Sahusa quickly grabbed a sword and shield that was nearby, preparing to fight. *Don’t look down on me! I am Sahusa the Great!*

“Sahusa. You better be alive in there.” The voice of Kyle wafting through the barricades sent a wave of relief through Sahusa’s body, nearly bursting out into tears.

The barricade was quickly torn down, with Sahusa clamouring to his feet. “Osir, did you kill Osir?”

“I have.” Kyle respond, tossing the decapitated head of Osir through the opening, the tendrils skidding along the vacant armoury’s floor. “We had a deal.”

Sahusa gulped. His ancestors had always warned him of human treachery, yet at this point he had no choice but to accept for now. As Kyle entered past the torn barricade, Sahusa immediately knelt on all twos. “I, Sahusa, King of the Goblins, in exchange for the grace and help that you have rendered me, plead allegiance to you for the remainder of my life.”

“Good. It’s time to stabilize the kingdom.”

With Osir now dead, the pacification of the remaining rebels went off without a hitch, though some defectors fled deeper into the mountains, scaling up the slopes towards the glaciers above. Combining the forces under Sasha’s control and the loyal followers of Sahusa, the chaos and disorder ended as abruptly as it had begun.

The food that Kyle’s forces had brought in originally only served as a stop-gap. “Sasha, send a message to Merissa to divert more food over here for the next two weeks, we need it to tide over until we become more self-sufficient here.”

[Understood.]

“Sahusa, gather a hundred of your most loyal troops and head to the Oracle’s entrance. I have convinced the Oracle to provide gifts.”

“A gift?!” Sahusa’s face immediately lit up, his respect for the Oracle’s omnipotence immeasurable.

An hour later, a hundred hobgoblins were standing outside the circular chamber in the expansive hallway, murmuring among themselves as they watched the first two dozen hobgoblins, along with King Sahusa, enter with Kyle guiding them in. The doors closed shut behind them, leaving the remaining hobgoblins wondering.

The hallway had been long cleaned up, Kyle having ordered the A.I to sweep up any remaining debris and bodies to prevent the surviving goblins from knowing the true nature behind the Oracle. Yet the hobgoblins were not bothered by the long dried blood stains on the floor, instead marvelling in awe at the carvings that extended all across the ceiling.

< I have never been in the Oracle’s chambers before. Why does it look so different from what we have outside? >

< Shut up, it’s a gift to be even able to enter such a holy place. The Oracle herself shall herald us into a golden age! >

As the hobgoblins discussed excitedly as to the origins of the Oracle over the next few minutes, the pneumatic doors slid open, revealing the same two dozen hobgoblins and King Sahusa. Those waiting outside were taken aback as they clearly saw a marked difference in the bodies of those who entered.

The most prominent change was that of King Sahusa, who had grown to a size nearly as large as Osir, his repressed genes activated by the green gas. It was a stark difference from his previously average height as a normal hobgoblin. Sahusa flexed his hands a bit, noticing the sheer power and strength flowing through his body. He had never felt better in his life.

He threw a punch, the vigorous blood swirling through his vein with a clear new level of power. < I feel like I can do anything! The Oracle has blessed us! >

Cheers erupted from the hobgoblins, the gift of the Oracle evident in front of them. Kyle smiled, watching his overtuned workforce come into being. *With this, everything should go much faster.* “Sahusa, I leave the rest to you. You already have the information on how to plant the seeds?”

“Yes, Lord Kyle.” Sahusa bowed with genuine respect to him, recognizing Kyle as the benefactor.

“Good. Work with Sasha to overcome the famine and follow her orders. Food supplies will arrive intermittently.”

“I understand… but where are you going?”

“I have a few personal issues to solve.” Kyle waved him off, heading to the rear of the chambers and entering the Genetic Chemicals section alone, sealing the door behind him. With the installation restored to a somewhat functional stage, the System Messages were now flooding his screen.

MG404: [System Message | Killed: [Improved Hobgoblin Guard] | +250 EXP]

MG404: [System Message | Killed: [Goblin King Osir] | +3000 EXP]

MG404: [ Level Up: 20 - 25 | All Stats Increased | Bonus Points Granted ]

MG404: [Class Announcement | Class Upgrade (Level 25) | Congratulations, Unique Class will now be upgraded| Please wait.]
# Chapter 71 - Subclass Selection

MG404: [Sub-Class Announcement | Sub-Class Upgrade (Level 20) | Congratulations, sub-classes will be unlocked now. | Please wait.]

MG404: [Class Announcement | Class Upgrade (Level 25) | Congratulations, Unique Class will now be upgraded| Please wait.]

The last time he had done a class upgrade was when he was level 10 – and it was an extremely painful process. If Kyle wanted to get the upgrades right now, he needed to do it somewhere out of sight and completely safe from any possible enemy attacks.

Kyle returned to the Genetic Chemicals section, sighing as he sat back down in the chair. Now that he had seen how the hobgoblins and goblins had been experimented on, a burning question began to nag in his mind. *How is the System conferring the skills onto me?*

Regardless, the moment he thought about the sub-class upgrades, a new system message appeared.

MG404: [Sub-Class Announcement | Generating Sub-Classes | Please Wait. | Please Wait.]

*It better be good this time, and before I make a final choice, I should ask for the skills first.* Kyle tapped his fingers impatiently, waiting for about a minute before the sub-class windows appeared.

MG404: [Sub-Class Announcement | Sub-Classes Generated | All subclasses come with only one class-unique skill at the start, up to a maximum of two. | Please choose carefully. A total of twelve subclasses have been created.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Arcia Mystic (Basic) | The flow of arcia energy is in your hands. | Skills are focused on manipulating the flow of arcia energy.]

MG404: [Skill | Arcia Disruption (Basic) | *Upwards instead of downwards* | Select one single engraving within five-meter radius to disrupt. Results may vary. Upgradable. Duration: Thirty Seconds. Cooldown: One day.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Tycoon (Basic) | Money makes the world go round. | Active Skills revolve around business acumen, persuasion and leadership.]

MG404: [Skill | Rich Man’s World (Basic) | Reduce the opposition people have towards your deals. | +10% Persuasion Success Chance. Upgradable. Duration: Five minutes. Cooldown: One day.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Slave Driver (Basic) | The means of production is only efficient with one leader. | Active Skills revolve around intimidation and manipulation.]

MG404: [Skill | Slave Engraving (Basic) | Don’t let your property escape. | Mark selected target with an invisible engraving that can be triggered to deliver intense pain. Target must mentally accept the engraving. Upgradable. Number of Engravings: Two]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Drug Cook (Basic) | Mixing nature to get people high. | Active Skills revolve around the increased quality of drugs and a higher chance to learn new recipes. ]

MG404: [Skill | Addictive Eye (Basic) | Know what makes people tick, or puke. | Highlights ingredient that have addictive properties. Differentiation in addiction levels obtainable through upgrading sub-class. Passive.]

Some of the subclasses were intriguing. Tycoon would be very useful, but Kyle didn’t think he needed any more ‘help’ in being persuasive, that was something that he could control on his own without the System’s help.

Slave Driver was interesting, with the perk of it being invisible. Current slave engravings came in the form of collars, with Kyle having already placed one on Guang Hwa and covering it with clothes. *I don’t think I need the System for that. Furthermore, it’s only two, and I can manufacture an unlimited amount of collars.*

Drug Cook had the most useless starting active skill. Sure, the System claims that there could be another skill if he upgraded the subclass, but he could easily figure out addiction within a few days.

What he was looking for was a skill that he would not be able to acquire naturally. The Arcia Disruption skill fit the bill slightly – he had never heard of an arcia engraving being disrupted before remotely, only physically.

Either way, he did not immediately dismiss the subclasses. There was still an ample selection of eight more to go, so he pulled up the next four that had been generated.

MG404: [Sub-Class Announcement | Displaying next four subclasses | Please Wait. | Please Wait.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Inventor (Basic) | Breaking the norm, one patent at a time | Active Skills revolve around an increased chance to optimise new blueprints for invented parts.]

MG404: [Skill | Possibilities (Basic) | To break the barriers of imagination | Highlights potential upgrades on a single component to improve efficiency. Upgradable. Duration: Ten minutes. Cooldown: One day.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Revolutionary (Basic) | Move the people with a wave of your hand | Active Skills revolve around crowd control and mood.]

MG404: [Skill | Riot Incitement (Basic) | By the people, for your purpose. | Agitates emotions and accelerate mob thinking. Five-meter radius. Upgradable. Duration: Ten minutes. Cooldown: One day.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Poisoner (Basic) | Mixing nature to kill people. | Active Skills revolve around poison and its applications.]

MG404: [Skill | Weakness Modifier (Basic) | Everyone has their failures, some just drink it. | Indicate one allergy immediately on a selected target. Five-meter radius. Upgradable. Duration: One minute. Cooldown: Two days.]

MG404: [Sub-Class Generated | Tamer (Basic) | Even the animals shall be exploited  | Active Skills revolve around subjugating animals for various uses.]

MG404: [Skill | Domestication (Basic) | Existence shall be put to greater use. | Makes one non-humanoid subservient indefinitely. Number of Tamed Creatures: 1]

*Inventor is absolutely useless.* Kyle could see why the System was generated such a subclass, considering the amount of ‘inventions’ that he had made over the course of his time here. Yet, when armed with the knowledge of the Galactic Era, why would he even need such a subclass?

As for the Revolutionary, while the skill might be useful in certain scenarios, Kyle had more than enough methods to achieve the same goal and objective. *Really, the System is looking down on me.*

Poisoner was an interesting skill in itself. Knowing the allergies of others would make them much much easier to control. Unfortunately, the cooldown was far too long. If he wanted to profile the entirety of his enemies it might take him months and years. It was also possible that the indicated allergy was non-lethal, proving to be useless. *Overall, an underwhelming skill for a poisoner role.*

Kyle was not a human nor humanoid supremacist in anyway – the Galactic Era had taught him a simple rule: if it can work, it can be exploited. So Tamer was of interest to him.

However, Tamer was not that much different from Slave Driver. And considering that he had already somewhat subjugated the hobgoblins and was on the verge of obtaining his own overtuned hobgoblin workforce, there was hardly no need for the Tamer class. Kyle thought about it critically, and tried to provide an argument internally that eventually he may come across monsters like giants that would need to be domesticate.

Yet, the auction in the Central Sector last year had already shown him that even a cyclops could be enslaved. *Let’s keep these four in view first then.*

MG404: [Sub-Class Announcement | Displaying last four subclasses | Please Wait. | Please Wait.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Serial Killer (Basic) | Once you start, you can’t stop. | Active Skills revolve around increasing stats the more you kill within a given timeframe.]

MG404: [Skill | Bloodlust (Basic) | Passion for blood | Combat stats against target in the specified duration is increased by 0.5% for every hit accumulated. Killing the target retains the bonus for five minutes. Upgradable. Duration: Thirty Seconds. Cooldown: One day.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Manufacturer (Basic) | Conformity through production  | Active Skills revolve around mass production and assembly lines]

MG404: [Skill | Mass Production Drones (Basic) | Two hands bad, more drones good. | Able to control up to two arctech drones remotely. Blueprint provided. Upgradable. Duration: Ten minutes. Cooldown: One day.]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Pact Maker (Basic) | Enforces written contracts to a certain level. | Active Skills revolve around applying debuffs to signatories who do not adhere to the contract.]

MG404: [Skill | Moral Justice (Basic) | Guilt manifest. | Creates a special contract. If a signatory goes against the contract, stats will suffer a permanent decrease of 10%. Applies to both sides. Upgradable. Number of Pacts: 1]

MG404: [ Sub-Class Generated | Shadow (Basic) | From the shadows you strike | Active Skills revolve around infiltration and self-concealment.]

MG404: [Skill | Silent Steps (Basic) | Even the bats do not hear you. | Reduce footstep noise to bare minimum. Upgradable. Duration: Twenty Seconds. Cooldown: One Hour.]

The subclass Serial Killer originally intrigued Kyle, but when he read the skill he immediately discarded it. He did not need extra help killing multiple targets  - he could easily invent a machine gun for that. And the stronger he grew, the more damage he would already do per hit, sometimes even killing them in one hit with his sniper rifle. *Perhaps against large monsters, but even a cyclops can be felled with a single shot.*

If he took the skill, it would mean that he had to hit the target about twenty times in order to receive a 10% damage bonus. *Does it work against static targets? Might be good for knocking down walls.*

MG404: [Clarification | Bloodlust (Basic) | Skill is only applicable against living organisms. Inorganic material cannot be ‘killed’.]

*Right.* Kyle ignored his obvious mistake and continued on. Manufacturer was looking quite good, and he might have taken the class up if it were not for the existence of the A.I and the ancient packing drones that he had seen in the Seed Storage section of the installation. Kyle had no doubt he could eventually repair and modify the drones, given the right materials, and subsequently reverse engineer the drones to make his own arctech versions.

*Maybe the System’s drones are far more advanced, but I don’t need that many drones either way.* Furthermore, the skill was limited in duration, which paled in comparison to his Seven Snakes members as well as hobgoblin workforce.

The Pact Maker subclass looked fairly interesting. Kyle was clear that the underworld contract was enforced by strength and reputation – many of the contracts served as proof of justice in the event one party decided to renegade on the terms. However, if one party had an overwhelming power advantage, the contract was completely unfair.

The problem laid in the fact that the debuff in stats would be applied to both sides. This meant that Kyle would also be restrained by the laws that he set forth himself. Furthermore, the skill did not guarantee that there was no loophole in the contract – Kyle not having his Galactic Era cranial implant meant that he could not remove such a possibility.

As such, a scenario existed in a way that the other signatory could exploit the loophole, and Kyle would be forced to follow the contract still, lest he wanted to suffer a debuff. *It would be good without the downsides.*

Shadow sounded good, but Kyle wasn’t really one to sneak in personally. He had followers for that very purpose, even training Sasha to that extent. *I could also design an arctech engraving to minimize the sound coming from my feet.*

With all the subclasses now presented, Kyle began the process of elimination. He kept in mind that the subclass could generate two skills maximum in the future.

*Let’s get the useless ones out of the way. Tycoon, Inventor, Revolutionary, Manufacturer, Drug Cook, Slave Driver, Tamer, Shadow are all useless, even if upgraded.*

Kyle swiped with his hands, manipulating the windows in front of him. The remaining list was Pact Maker, Arcia Mystic, Serial Killer and Poisoner.

He held a small hope that Pact Maker would work, but he also noted that even if the signatory suffered the permanent debuff, it would be a one-time affair. With him only having knowledge of the System, it would not be an effective measure to ensure that the other party would adhere to the terms of the contract.

Sure, there was a edge use-case in which he could use it to weaken an enemy, but it seemed too complicated to execute. Any enemy that he could bring to the negotiating table meant that he had a similar power range, or at least, enough bargaining power already. *It’s a ‘win-harder’ class, but I don’t particularly need it.*

Arcia Mystic was a weird one, and the only subclass to deal directly with the flow of arcia. While the skill was limited in ability, it still served as a potential game-changer in many of the duels. Kyle could think of so many ways he could have made some past fights much easier with the ability to disrupt an engraving. He kept it for now, considering the next class.

Serial Killer’s current skill was not that enticing, but Kyle wondered if the second generated skill would be good. However, it was essentially gambling, and for all the casinos that Kyle has built in his life, he never placed his entire faith in luck, only making decision based on what he had in front of him. As such, he had to discard the sub-class, knowing that his strength would soon dwarf the usefulness of the skill. *It’s also a ‘win-harder’ class.*

Poisoner was the one that Kyle held the most hesitation about. If he could use the class to know what was Sebastian’s allergies, then it would make it easier to eliminate him. Yet, there was still a vast gap between knowing the allergy and actually executing an elimination plan. *If the skill tells me he’s allergic to seafood with nothing but a mild rash… I might just try to rip out the System of my own body.*

Unwilling to take the risk, Kyle only had the Arcia Mystic left as the viable subclass. He checked again some of the subclasses that he had eliminated in the first round, going through them again. *It’s the only class that provides me with a skill I don’t already know how to implement.* Without hesitating any longer, he selected the Arcia Mystic sub-class.

MG404: [WARNING | Sub-class Integration Beginning | Please find a safe location. | Please find a safe location.]

Before Kyle could even brace himself, the familiar sharp, sudden jabbing pain erupted at the nape of his neck.  The fiery pain shot through the nerves, spine and bones like lightning, causing him to wince and fall off the chair, writhing in pain. *How is this as painful as the main class upgrade?!*

MG404: [WARNING | Class Upgrade Beginning | Please find a safe location. | Please find a safe location.]

*Shit, the System is combining both upgrades into one?!*

As he rolled around the floor, a million needles prickling his skin, he could feel the same foreign object in his body slicing away at his internal organs and underlying flesh, as though it was rearranging his vessels and blood flow, albeit in a brutal gruesome fashion.

[Sir, you seem to be experiencing severe distress.] The A.I’s holographic image appeared. [Symptoms include talking to oneself and undergoing extreme cramp cycles. Do you need me to play you some soothing music?]

Kyle grunted unintelligibly, unable to reply in coherent words as the pain continued to envelop his entire being. He began to struggle to keep awake, the continuous waves and bouts of pain nearly making him lose consciousness.

“Ti..tis is nuthin…” Kyle tried to speak, nearly biting his own tongue off. The spasms caused his body to convulse on the floor, making him involuntarily hit his head against the edge of a gas tank before falling unconscious.
# Chapter 72 - Golden Age

Kyle gasped as he jolted awake, his eyes darting around the room. He raised his arms gingerly, noticing he was lying in a puddle of blood leaking from regenerating skin– a side-effect of his class upgrade.

Two screens hovered in his vision.

MG404: [ Sub-Class Obtained | Arcia Mystic (Basic) | The flow of arcia energy is in your hands. | Skills are focused on manipulating the flow of arcia energy.]

MG404: [Skill Obtained | Arcia Disruption (Basic) | *Upwards instead of downwards* | Select one single engraving within five-meter radius to disrupt. Results may vary. Upgradable. Duration: Thirty Seconds. Cooldown: One day.]

MG404: [Skill Obtained | Designate Follower (Intermediate) | Can’t be a crime lord without underlings | Marks any sapient being as a follower, enabling telepathic communication. Stat increase for each follower within five hundred meters. Limit of two followers.]

Kyle smiled to himself, despite the copious amount of blood that had pooled around him. However, as he tried to sit up, he suddenly realised something critical that he needed to test immediately. *Select one single engraving within five-meter radius to disrupt… does that affect my own engravings?*

He decided to test it now immediately, despite the cooldown being one day. He painted himself as the target.

*Arcia Disruption!*

A warbling visual effect surged from his body as the centre, forming a sort of translucent wave that rebounded back into him.

*Penchant for Violence!*

Instead of feeling the same familiar surge of power rushing through his blood, Kyle winced from a backflow of arcia energy, sent into turmoil by the negation field. The pain erupted from deep within his body as though he had an engraving in there.

*What does this mean?* Kyle questioned himself internally, but he already knew the answer all along since his first Class Upgrade : the System has been engraving the skills onto his body or readjusting his internals to generate the skill effect. This also explained why every single class upgrade was so painful and agonising, as though someone was carving away at his flesh.

Kyle had always held the notion that arctech was not a form of magic but rather a special exotic element that simply had magic-like properties. He had seen other exotics have equally amazing properties, but he had never heard of one which could be imbued into the human body like this without rejection.

Nearly every study of the Galactic Era stated that humans could not integrate exotics normally without completely modifying their genetic makeup to adapt. Kyle wondered now if all humans on this planet were of a specific variant, able to ingest and manipulate arcia normally.

*But how did the humans get here in the first place?*  Kyle could not confidently say he knew exactly what happened in the history of this planet. It could still very well be a virtual reality game, though it seems to be straying even further from that angle.

Time travel was a possibility as well - Kyle was not unaware of time anomalies present in the more chaotic sections of the Milky Way Galaxy.

The installation that he was in as well did not look like an evacuation shelter either but rather as an observation laboratory. *Perhaps they studying the natives, which were the goblins.*

As Kyle was weighing the different theories he had, the A.I’s holographic image appeared. [Good morning, sir. It has been three days since you were last awake.]

“Three days?” Kyle was astonished. The previous class upgrade took only the better part of a day; he did not expect to be knocked out for so long. *Perhaps it was also due to the main class upgrade as well.* “Is the stabilisation of the goblins complete?”

[Yes, sir. All goblins are now united under King Sahusa. Agricultural reforms are in progress, though from my observations, they have encountered a hitch.]

“Understood, I’ll have it solved.”

Kyle nodded, standing up with the sludge around him sliding off. The facility had no functioning showers left, so Kyle had no choice but to head back to the palace.

The new hobgoblin guards, made up of the loyal knights of Sahusa, were standing guard outside the Oracle Chamber under the orders of the King Sahusa. They were told not to fidget or stray from their duties, but an overpowering foul stench, as though someone had bled to death, soon assaulted their senses, nearly causing them to gag.

< What is this stench?! Not even my mother’s cooking is this bad! >

The guard turned to see Kyle marching out with a blank expression, his body stained with disgusting streaks of blood as though he had massacred an entire hive of alien ants.

< Is this an abomination? > One guard put his sword up at the ready before the other hobgoblin guard smacked him on the head.

< Idiot! This is the human that King Sahusa told us about! >

< Really? The smell is vastly different from that of the female human monster… >

Kyle ignored their bickering, simply stepping past them and heading straight to the king’s room, where Sahusa was relaxing.

Sahusa took a whiff of the air before he screamed at the appalling appearance of Kyle.

“Why are you screaming?”

“Have you not looked at yourself?! Servants, quickly! Give this human a bath!”

The goblin servants led Kyle towards a large bath area, where a small waterfall cascaded down from a cavernous river, the flow blasting away the grime and stains on Kyle’s body.

The fact that there were no proper shower room or bath irked Kyle. *The facilities here definitely need to be improved.* Kyle examined the state of the palace. It was indeed opulent but could be designed to be much more efficient and relaxing. *A task for later – let’s see the overall progress.*

Kyle got Sahusa to bring him around the valley to observe the projects implemented and to learn of the current issues.

“It’s only been three days since we have reunited the goblins – we are focusing on the terrace farming project as instructed by the Oracle.” Sahusa pointed out to a nearby sloped section of the valley, where sectioned terraces were already carved out and planted with the modified radish seeds. Rows upon rows of elevated farms were being carved out, the work mostly accomplished by the recently enhanced hobgoblins.

All hundred of them were put to good use, digging canals and irrigation channels to provide ample water to the soil, keeping it damp and moist. Sahusa escorted Kyle around, pointing towards a sapling that was already germinating, the leaves vibrant.

“According to the instructions, the soil should be dark and moist, full of nutrients when planting such a seed. However, as you can see…” Sahusa grabbed a fistful of the soil, most of which were loose dust and sand. “The seeds are rapidly absorbing the moisture faster than we can water.”

Kyle glanced at the irrigation canals, noticing that the water flow was a mere trickle, and hardly enough to sustain the increased requirements of the modified radish. This was the downside of having a much faster growth cycle which drew nutrients and resources way beyond the normal range. 

“Can we utilize the main tributary?” Kyle pointed towards the snaking river at the base of the valley that was far below the terrace farms.

“We’ve tried carrying the water in buckets up, but its far too strenuous.”

Kyle sighed in despair at the goblin king’s stupidity, blaming himself for assuming that the goblins would be able to industrialize on their own. “Sasha, are you in the area?”

[Yes, sir.]

“Have Merissa and Feldon arrived?”

[Yes, sir, they are working to distribute the food among the goblins.]

“Good. Once they are done with that, have them build a waterwheel to ferry water upwards in a pulley system. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about.”

[Yes, sir. The prospector Raksha is also here as well. He is at the base of the valley currently, investigating for iron.]

“Understood, I’ll be there shortly.”

Ordering King Sahusa to work with Merissa and Feldon, Kyle himself headed down to the base, where a large gaping hole in the side of the mountain loomed over him, the entrance to a crude iron mine that the goblins have been using.

Unsurprisingly, there was not much infrastructure, with the goblins doing everything by hand. Right now, Raksha was accompanied by a few goblins, inspecting the mine.

“Sir, the mine is definitely rich in iron, alongside a few coal seams.” Raksha presented the result of a geological borehole that had been lowered fifty meters into the ground. “This iron mine could last for two hundred years even if it supplied the whole of Raktor.”

“That’s good news.” Kyle nodded in affirmation. With the acquisition of iron and coal, all he had to do now was to create a distribution network towards Raktor. “Can the existing tunnel network be connected with our current progress?”

“I’m not entirely sure, but it would be definitely be far less work than digging an entirely brand new tunnel. But the air within the tunnels would be severely limited.”

“Not a problem, we can solve that easily.”

Kyle wasted no time, instantly getting King Sahusa to order the other idle goblins into the mines. Only a few enhanced hobgoblins were assigned, the rest being small weak standard goblins. He did not plan on upgrading every single hobgoblin, as with increased power naturally came increased consumption. Until he stabilized the food production locally, he could not afford to let the general population evolve just yet. Furthermore, it could serve as a form of reward for those who had work hard, establishing a sort of hierarchy inherently.

Over the next week, the redevelopment of the Culdao Peaks proceeded with little hitches. Any defectors or agitators that attempted to further destabilize the goblin society were instantly eradicated by Sasha’s strike force.

The waterwheels were constructed swiftly, the surrounding trees utilized for easy construction material and solving the irrigation issue.

At the same time, water was routed towards the mine to speed up the digging process as well as a rudimentary steel factory that was slowly being built up. However, it was not without obstacles.

“The blast furnace will need to be of sufficient scale to achieve a profit when heating up.” Kyle explained to Feldon. “And the entire method of delivery from the iron ore deposit to the blast furnace and out into a basic oxygen converter.”

“A what converter…?” Feldon was confused, having no background in chemistry or anything to do with engineering.

Kyle sighed, quickly drawing out a system diagram on a piece of paper, his style of labelling and shapes completely different to whatever Feldon was accustomed to.

“Let me simplify it for you – raw iron and coking coal is mixed into pig iron, then slammed into a large pot where we blast oxygen, a constituent of air, into it, blowing away the excess carbon and forming steel. We then pour it out into a mold. As much as possible, this entire process should be completely automated, save for the mining.”

“Uhh….”

“Never mind, I’ll handle it.” Kyle regretted not having Reese or Gordon here, but they were still busy building the weapons factory as well as the trade school back in Raktor. The oblivious expression on Feldon’s face only served to remind Kyle of just how important it was to have skilled arctech designers.

He had the A.I break it down into a simple steps for instruction, using King Sahusa once again to oversee the construction. While that was in progress, Kyle checked up on the mine, where the tunnelling process was already beginning.

It was a forty-kilometre distance from the iron ore deposit to the factory, which meant significant amounts of ventilation and filtering of air would be necessary to make it less dangerous for the workers. Kyle explained the plan to Merissa and Raksha. “We only need ventilation for the mine and the receiving end of the resources. For everything else in between, the carriage would be completely encased and supplied with its own air. That would be easier than digging ventilation shafts everywhere, or wasting energy to pump it in.”

“Like a diving bell… but how are we going to lay the tracks?”

“We’ll craft the tracks by hand here in the temporary steel factory. It won’t be the best quality, but we can iteratively upgrade it when we have the weapons factory set up in Raktor. We’ll rotate workers in and out through the tracks.”

With no time to spare, some of the heavier equipment were ordered in from Raktor. The sinter plant, coke overs, blast furnace and ladles were all ordered from other manufacturers under the wing of Baron Cain.

At the same time, Kyle crafted a rudimentary mine cart, one that had compressed air inside along with makeshift tubes that could allow deep miners to replenish their own air tanks. Much time was spent creating generic air-tight helmets and pressurized crude iron tanks.

The following week, the first laying of the newly manufactured rail tracks began in earnest. Groups of goblin workers dug in parallel, some of which had already been digging for more than four months to this point, having very nearly reached Raktor.

The harvested radish also boosted the morale of the goblins even more, with the famine successfully being solved. More and more workers entered the mines, expanding it and accessing even more iron veins under the guidance of Raksha and Merissa.

As the tunnel became deeper and deeper, it became harder and harder for the goblin to manually push the mine cart along the tracks, especially with limited air. Kyle quickly drafted and crafted a temporary solution, repurposing parts of a normal arctech wagon and attaching it to the minecart, allowing it to be driven properly.

Soon, after three weeks since Kyle pacified the goblins, the tunnel was soon to be completed. Reese and Gordon waited at the end of their basement tunnel right below the factory. They had constructed a basic platform of sorts, preparing to ease the loading and unloading of goods.

Reese was about to check the time again when the soil in front of him began to crack open, bursting out to reveal fifteen goblins, all sweating and panting, their temporary helmets and tanks filled with air weighing them down tremendously. Behind them lay a continuous stretch of railway tracks with the first crafted mine cart on it. 

He quickly added his own air pump on this end of the tunnel, filling the tunnel with air. As he worked with the goblins and hauled the first batch of steel tracks up, a rumbling sound could be heard as a second mine cart attached with an arctech engine hurtled down the tracks like a rollercoaster, with Kyle being the first test passenger.

The cart came to a stop at the end with manual braking. He stepped out of the cart shakily, immediately jotting down notes on a clipboard while a large bruise on his forehead was visible.

“Section 4-D is not aligned properly; Section 2-A nearly took my head clean off – needs to be wider. Steel quality in 5-D is not good; severe fatigue noted – mark for replacement.” Kyle muttered to himself as he ordered for minor fixes to the tunnel tracks, making sure it was smooth as possible for quick transportation.

The tunnel now served as a direct transportation route. Critical tools and other essential goods were immediately transported down the tunnel, the mine carts pushed by arctech towards the Culdao Peaks, and in return, processed steel bars were stacked neatly, allowing the weapons factory to kick into action. However, due to the small nature of the tunnel, it only allowed for one mine cart to enter at a time. A simple lighting system with controllers at intermediate points allowed the operators to know if there was a mine cart convoy currently travelling the tunnel.

“How’s the progress of the weapon’s factory?” Kyle inquired of Reese as he exited the cart.

“Everything is in place, all preliminary machinery installed.” Reese showed Kyle around the completed weapons factory, the conveyor belts already in place with workstations defined. They were not the best money could buy, but Kyle had other ideas on how to improve production.

“Good. Time to make some money.”

MG404: [Stats Table]
# Chapter 73 - Snowball

The opening ceremony of the weapons factory was simple and muted, but did not go unnoticed. Many of the desperate poor and homeless were enticed by the various rumours floating about, hundreds flocking in droves towards the Seven Snakes district, in the hopes of a better secure future. The advertisement that was now aired through distributed light-throwers in various pubs around further enticed those looking for a new lease, a new chance at life as well as those who needed financial assistance.

“I’m sick and tired of living in the slums, why wouldn’t I get a free apartment if I can?” The more adventurous of them began to migrate, moving from districts beyond the Seven Snakes' control. Rows upon rows of applicants began to swarm the Golden Snakes Construction office situated near the shopping arcade, where job openings were a dime a dozen, along with a standard apartment that was far better than the shelters they had been in before.

[And with this, I declare the Aspis Weapons Factory open! A ground-breaking innovation in assembly and manufacturing processes, to herald the new golden age of Raktor in!] Gordon announced, the first batch of workers cheering in full force, mostly out of cheer for better wages and their new dwellings.

A tour was summarily provided for the other attendees of the opening ceremony, who mostly comprised of other business owners and sycophants of Baron Cain. With Baron Cain’s co-ownership of the factory it was easier than ever for the Seven Snakes to position themselves as a legal incorporated entity, despite the control clearly in the hands of Kyle.

“I never expected you to have the factory ready for me this quickly – truly amazing.” Cain praised Kyle. Of course, it wasn’t the fact that the Baron now had a weapons factory: he always had them, but those factories were more of a partnership with the military rather than a fully private venture such as this one, which did not divert funds into Count Leon’s pockets.

This allowed him to amass his own political power base, independent of the manufacturers and suppliers that other Barons had to rely on. What’s more, with the raw materials being derived from the Culdao Peaks, Baron Cain was effectively invincible to any price fluctuations that Count Leon might attempt to stir.

Kyle too was happy with what has been accomplished. The Ardent Cretins’ blockade was still in place, but as soon as the food supply was stabilized in the Culdao Peaks, plans were already in place for the goblin kingdom to be a net exporter of raw materials, both agricultural and industrial. This vertical economy gave Kyle complete control over the pricing and profit, enabling a steady income. *Perhaps a second weapons factory there as well.*

Thus, the financial maneuvering of Sebastian hardly meant a thing to Kyle any longer, except for the physical hijackings and attempts at harassment. Transport wagons were still being raided on a weekly basis, constituting a real security threat. The tunnel alleviate some of that, but Euria Seeds and other supplies still travelled over land on the regular.

“With the weapons factory established, we can now apply for the supply contract set forth by Count Leon’s military. There is only a month left to demonstrate the weapons. Any later and the supply contract may be rescinded.” Baron Cain explained the next step of the plan. It wasn’t as simple as the military throwing money at Kyle and the Baron – they had to convince the generals of their product’s efficacy against their competitors.

Furthermore, the military exercise was to serve as the backdrop for a potential invasion of Versia. Kyle had no doubt that at least a minor conflict or skirmish would erupt during the exercise itself - this would be the profit point that he had to leverage on.

“How much and what do you need?”

“The demonstration will be a mock battle between knights from other Barons and suppliers. I will need enough equipment to arm one of my knight squads for testing. Assume that it is a standardized set that can be issued to regular soldiers.”

“I will begin work immediately. The design will take a while.”

“Can you get it done under a month? The earlier you can get it done, the more pressure we can put on the other suppliers.”

“No promises, but we’ll do our best. In the meantime, I will produce the standard rifles as afforded by the license to grease the wheels.”

They shook on it, the two parting ways as Kyle began proper operations of the weapons factory. “Gordon, you’re with me for now. Keith, have the designers organized and briefed in the trade school, I’ll drop by later.”

The first batch of newly hired technicians were all gathered in their respective teams. Most of them were old hires from the previous factory, yet to see their old workplace undergoing a massive overhaul was nothing short of an amazing feat. Some thought they would have spent their entire lives under the same grimy black ceilings and failing machinery.

Utilizing the new structure that Kyle had implemented, Gordon had the old hires split up into twenty production teams, five supply teams, three design teams and a single management team, Gordon himself being the top overall. The bulk of the workforce gathered in front of him were technicians and etchers, helmed by an experienced foreman.

The production teams were not solely comprised of technicians and a single foreman – three foreman and five logistics workers served as the attached support staff, allowing the production team to interface with the design team and subsequently management team.

Contrary to usual roles in other factories nearby, the design team also had old technicians embedded with them. Kyle never believed in the idea that one could design a product without having intimate experience in actually making them.

With the teams having a somewhat holistic makeup, this ensured that the factory operated efficiently and with clear distinction of roles. In this way, the production team was designed akin to a autonomous unit, able to achieve its own supply requirements through the five logistical staff members attached.

Gordon cleared his throat as he stepped up onto a makeshift platform of extra construction materials, his voice amplified through a series of arctech radios embedded along the length of the wall while he gripped the microphone in his hand. Introducing the basics of the factory as well as the organizational hierarchy, Gordon finally neared the end of the briefing.

“Each production team will be trained to develop multiple products. Our factory is not like the old ones, nor is it like the others in Raktor – you will be instructed and taught by your foremen to be versatile. As demand is not fixed, we as the suppliers must be able to adapt to changes on the fly, hence the high requirement on your holistic understanding of the product lines.”

The somewhat unique structure had the old hires confused, many used to the old days of factory workers only being a single cog in the machine, focusing on just a very small task. Being transformed from a single task specialist into a generalist was far more than many technicians could handle.

“No human was born knowing how to etch arcia, so do not underestimate the potential for your brain to learn more than you started with. Grow with us, and we shall help you achieve your dreams and security for your family. Of course, with appropriate compensation for your efforts.” Gordon concluded. Many cheered, but there were a few who only gave nods or grunts in response.

Kyle scanned the crowd, noticing a few obviously disgruntled workers from the old factory amdist the production team. He could sense that they were jealous of their former co-workers and especially Gordon taking higher positions, while the majority of them were still in the production teams, toiling away as technicians.

For now, the lower worker hours of eight hours instead of sixteen and the free housing were keeping them in check and satisfied, but Kyle knew this wouldn’t last forever. It was the human condition to always adapt and seek for more than what he currently had. Furthermore, once they had obtained the contract, production would have to ramp up eventually, but that would be a problem for the future. *Nothing stays the same forever, not even me.*

The first batch of workers dispersed, heading towards their assigned assembly lines for training. Kyle had already issued preliminary designs of the Seven Snakes armour pieces, as well as a standard basic design of the current Raktor’s military rifle, provided to him by Baron Cain.

“Shouldn’t we start off with our final design? Like the weapons and armour that we are going to deliver to Baron Cain.” Gordon remarked to Kyle as they oversaw the training. “It seems inefficient to have them learn a specific engraving or assembly procedure, seeing that they would have to re-learn everything again.”

“And do you have our final design?”

“… No, sir.”

“Then let’s wait until the design team is brought up to speed before doing anything. This preliminary training will serve as a good buffer and a way to test the efficiency of the system.”

While Kyle was confident in his implementation of the factory structure, it was by all means a educated guess. Without the help of his cranial implant, Kyle could hardly recall every little single optimization that humanity has learnt over the years, and those optimizations would also not be applicable in a vastly different era. He was too used to robotic automation producing everything at the touch of the button.

As such, the training will both help Kyle to tailor the operations to its peak efficiency, while also producing new armour sets for the newly recruited Seven Snakes members. He had never made armour for anyone who had joined since the Ilysian Punks War, which amounted close to five hundred new associates. Some of the new associates, unsurprisingly, were also working in the weapons factory in various roles. *I should have them inducted soon as well, and trained.*

“I’ll leave things in your care. Any issues or suspicions, report it either to Damian or me immediately.”

“Understood, sir.”

Kyle proceeded to the trade school, where Keith had just concluded an introductory briefing to the newly recruited arctech designers, which numbered about thirty, which was far lower than what had been promised. They were now gathered in the new auditorium built like a lecture hall, each of them taking a seat amdist the rows of benches facing the blackboard.

“I expected fifty.” Kyle whispered to Keith as he walked up to the podium.

“I’m still trying to recruit the other twenty, but many are not answering our advances or returning reply to our offers. Should I expand the recruiting to non-graduates? There are many more that we can hire that might not have a university degree.”

“Do it, we have no time. I need them in by the end of the week.” Kyle needed more hands on deck in order to build the standardized knight set – it would be far too much effort on his own, even if he had taken the Manufacturer sub-class.

Keith nodded, handing over the marked attendance list. However, one name was clearly missing, Kyle noticing that only twenty-nine were present.

“Where is he?”

“Last known contact was in the East Sector three days ago. Most likely the Tul’e Da’li got wind of this movement and are stalling him indefinitely.”

Kyle internally sighed, but did not lament too much about it. If he were in the major gang’s position he would have done the same. *Or perhaps even worse.* “Let’s move on without him, we’re on a deadline.” Kyle took center stage, immediately explaining the overall process.

“Keith would have already informed you in the briefing prior, but for the sake of clarity, let me repeat: You are now working under a joint venture between Golden Snakes Construction and Baron Cain. Any leaks of classified patents or engravings is punishable by death under the Sanctum of Yual, and I am also legally allowed to execute said punishment. Understood?”

The audience murmured with a few nods, clearly inattentive to Kyle’s words. Many of the designers in this room were not from the districts near the Seven Snakes, some coming from the Red Lions or the Wretches. Kyle shot a glare at Keith, who quickly shook his head.

“It seems that there is a slight misunderstanding on who are your superiors here.” Kyle began, only to be interrupted by a scoff from an older designer.

“A young kid lording over us, when he hasn’t even attended the University of Raktor? Give me a break. If this is how I am to be lectured during my stay here, I believe my time is better spent in a far more prestigious company.”

“Then please. The exit is that way.” Kyle motioned towards the lecture hall’s door.

Yet the older designer did not move, knowing that the salary was what drew him here in the first place. Even if he became a professor at the university, there was no way he would be paid anywhere close to what Kyle was paying him.

“If you choose to stay, then understand this.” Kyle left the podium, walking through the steps of the lecture hall between the rows of seats. “If I say run, you run. If I say jump, you jump. If I say sit, you sit. If I say understood, you say yes sir. Understood?”

The arctech designers looked at each other confusedly, before a sudden wave of pressure erupted from Kyle, the designers’ heart all seemingly gripped in fear, as though a terrible behemoth had just appeared in the hall, embodying the essence of terror.

“I said… understood?”

“YES, SIR!” Even the older designer sat upright now, the sweat trickling down his back from the shivering fear.

“Good. With that out of the way, the first project that the weapons factory will be undertaking is an improved version of the standardized arctech knight suit that Raktor’s military currently use. Each of you will be split into three teams to take care of different aspects of the armour as well as weapons. Your design lead will temporarily be me, who will oversee all requirements and testing of the knight suit for the next month. Understood?”

“YES, SIR!”

“Team A, you’re on the armour materials and etching requirements. You will set the standard for the body armour as well as etching guidelines for all production teams to follow. Standardization is key here. Team B, work with team A on the armour and create two variations of the knight suit – one focused on defence and the other on mobility without sacrificing protection. You have the original design to work off, find the flaws and fix them.”

“Team C, your job is to improve the weapons. Start by working on the rifle. You will also be provided with the design for the Oriental Bloom.”

That last mention of the handgun sent a wave of gasps between the designers, many of whom had already heard about the miraculous handgun that had efficient arctech design. The older designer was half-amazed, half-perplexed. “But how? Even the Raktor military did not have the design… unless…?”

“Stop wondering and get to work.”

@@@

“Who is this lowborn peasant working with Baron Cain?!” Count Leon raged to himself, calling up all the business owners under him. “Why haven’t we cut off all sources of iron ore and coal to him?!” Count Leon pressed, knowing the region of Raktor and all prospected iron ore deposits. He was sure that he had full control of all of them.

[We have! We stopped selling iron ore and coal to them three days ago when they applied for the contract, but according to our observers, the factory is still running.]

Count Leon hung up in anger, pondering the situation. *If they are still able to run, it either means they are stealing from my iron mines or they have found a new one! Unacceptable!*

He found the notion of the first theory ridiculous, seeing as he had his own armed forces guarding the iron mines tightly, which meant that the second theory was far more valid. He immediately arranged a meeting with Baron Cain, planning to pressure him into giving up the new mines if they existed.

“Baron Cain, you understand well that this entire region of Raktor is under my jurisdiction. Running an illegal mining operation in my territory is tantamount to a declaration of war on my title. Forget buying your weapons, I could have you stripped of your nobility on accounts of conspiracy against your betters.” Count Leon instantly threatened as he strode into the visitor’s room, where Baron Cain sat and carefully sipped on the edge of a delicate tea cup.

“You don’t have any evidence of such an operation, and only the Duke has the right to strip my title if it came down to that.” Baron Cain calmly replied. “However, if, hypothetically, there was such a mining operation, it can only be considered illegal if the mining rights have been given to you.”

“All mining rights in Raktor have been given to me by the Duke himself. And by extension of his authority granted from Tryas, the Emperor!”

“Ah, but not for every mine in the entirety of Raktor, am I right? I seem to recall a few illegal arcite mines that have not been declared to the Emperor as well. Has he given you the rights to them as well? I’m sure Tryas would be very interested in such mines for national security.”

Count Leon stiffened slightly as his threat faltered, his eyes narrowing at Baron Cain. “You… what are you aiming at?”

“Count Leon. We have much to benefit from a mutual agreement here.” Baron Cain rose from his chair, pacing slowly. “You want to win a war, however small. I want to prove my loyalty. My factory will produce quality weapons and armor. For a Count to actively sabotage his own military suppliers directly will… not speak well of your reputation.”

“My reputation will not suffer if it was made clear that you are in cahoots with the Seven Snakes! I should immediately issue an county order and revoke the weapon’s manufacturing license. A gang leader should not possess such a dangerous document – only a full master of the Weapons Guild of Raktor is able to hold such a license.”

“The landed nobles of the Yual Dominion have full executive power to issue weapon licenses to whomever they please, guild or not. Unless you are implying that the whims of the craft guild are far above the actions of the nobles.” Baron Cain countered. “And revoking the license will be equivalent to preventing me, a Baron of Raktor, from producing my own weapons. Need I remind you that I currently own half of the factory? Or perhaps you would like to escalate the matter to the Duke?”

Count Leon did not reply immediately, thinking carefully while Baron Cain continued: “You do not lose anything in the establishment of my factory: the military gets better equipment, and you win your glories over Versia. It’s a win-win, with the only loser being Versia. Do you not hate the condescending gloating faces of the nobles in Tryas every year? They think of us as borderland buffoons, on par with that of Kregol and Perlis. With my factory, your prestige will surpass anyone present and future.”

As much as Count Leon hated how Baron Cain managed to get the upper hand on him, he did not disagree with the concept of showing up the nobles in Tryas. Far too often, he had been looked down on for the rowdy and crime-ridden city of Raktor.

Yet, accepting Baron Cain’s new factory would jeopardize the business relationships of all his suppliers and supporters that he was planning to enrich as well. The Weapons Guild would be swarming him as well.

“Fine.” Count Leon eventually compromised on the surface, seemingly unwilling to start a fight with Baron Cain. “I agree to the deal. Let us negotiate on a later date.”

“Of course, Count Leon.”

As soon as Baron Cain was out of hearing distance, Count Leon reached for a nearby arctech phone, twisting the ratchets to a specific channel. “Sebastian, I have a job for you.”
# Chapter 74 - Education Access

Despite the first batch of workers being well experienced with the old factory's procedures and assembly process, it was still a tall order to jump from making benign household products to military-grade arctech steel that had to withstand brutal conditions over long periods. 

Furthermore, most of their experience was based on machines that they were intimately familiar with. As the factory slowly lurched into the production of standard rifles and breastplates, the shaping of steel and required accuracy of engraving was far beyond their current skills. 

The training thus did not go as smoothly as expected, with numerous errors and inefficient etchings being spotted on the produced engravings. Kyle dug through a wooden crate filled to the brim with the failed products, trying to pinpoint where the source of error was. 

Kyle naturally had expected something of this nature to occur, putting untrained technicians into a brand new assembly line. Yet due to the tight deadline, it was even more critical for him to try and reduce the training requirements, so as to hire more technicians.

Currently, the Aspis Weapons Factory was not employing to its maximum capacity, instead only having around 30% of the employees that Kyle was originally designing the layout for. This led to a conspicuous void on the factory floor, where entire assembly lines laid dormant.

The issue of employment could be easily solved if Kyle had just approached the Weapons Guild of Raktor, but due to the immense salary that he was splurging on the arctech designers, he could not afford the cost of hiring experienced apprentices or journeymen from the guild. *No doubt that the guild or unions will eventually throw a tantrum once I have this batch trained.*

“We need a few designers to serve as quality control…” Kyle muttered to himself, knowing that it would be ridiculous for him to check every single item alone, nor could he have Gordon, the head of the factory be continuously inspecting each item.

MG404: [Item | Seven Snakes Breastplate (Degraded) | *Tarnished by improper etching* | +2 VIT, +1 MAX HP. Active Skill: Deflect (Basic) – Able to block up to one medium-speed projectiles. Duration: Ten Seconds. MP Cost Per Activation: 15 MP. Cooldown: Ten hours.]

"This is terrible..." Gordon remarked as he looked through the pile of rifles and plates. "An absolute waste of resources."

The effects of the breastplate was far worse than the original. Nearly every factor had been worsened. Kyle then returned to the factory, observing a single production team in action as they manufactured one more for training.

First, the steel bars delivered from the Culdao Peaks were heated up, rolled and flattened to the required dimensions, forming a steel plate. Kyle didn’t think the error was occurring over here, following the now pressed steel plate towards a molding station, where the steel plate was now bent slowly to match the curve required.

After that, the engraving was etched on to it, each breastplate worked on by various technicians who each etched a specific portion of the entire engraving design onto it. Kyle soon found the problem, noticing that the hands of the technicians were quite shaky and unfocused, unable to accurately carve out most of the finer engravings, leading to losses in arctech energy being dissipated.

In the old factory, it used to be the designers themselves who would perform the etching, but Kyle wanted to shift away from that. Yet there was barely enough time to have the technicians brought up to speed. He needed to find a method in which the technicians could easily replicate the etch.

*As long as they have a guideline, then it would be easier to follow.* Kyle quickly had Gordon fashion a breastplate with proper etching, but instead of leaving it as an example. Kyle used the hot burning tip of the etcher to melt cleanly through instead, gouging out the shape of the engraving on the breastplate.

Repeating it for all outer and inner sides of the breastplate, Kyle had the gouged out breastplate tested in a production line. Immediately, accuracy greatly improved, the technicians simply following along the path that had been set for them. By matching the template to the incoming breastplate, each technician could etch by simply inserting the tip of the etcher into the gouged grooves and tracing along.

“Have twenty of this ready, and get the design team to ensure that all engravings can be performed like this, especially for the rifle’s barrel.” Kyle instructed Gordon, heading over now to check on the design team.

Motivated by the high salary as well as Kyle’s intimidation, the designers were hard at work, already coming up with a few preliminary ideas. The same older designer ,who once belittled Kyle, was now heading the materials team as he hurriedly introduced the new concepts.

“Metal armour is far outdated, especially with the design breakthroughs that the Oriental Bloom has inspired. With more guns now firing more rapidly, it is even more critical for the soldier to be able to avoid. Hence, we are working on deriving a lighter form of armour that can still provide significant protection while affording mobility.” The older designer showed a few pieces of paper, detailing the theoretical proposals. “First, we have the idea of a thinner steel plate in general. This would be the fastest way to achieve weight reduction for the arctech knight.”

“Rejected. The integrity of the plate would disintegrate after a single impact.” Kyle instantly remarked, but the older designer was not fazed, as if he was half expecting it.

“Second, a metal vest -  a chainmail, if you will. The chainmail will be hidden under the military uniform, and would be significantly lighter than plate armour.”

“Hmmm, possible. Have that tested in the firing range for penetration and disintegration.”

“Dis-int what?”

“Nevermind, just test the rifles against it. Next?”

“Next is an interesting proposition by yours truly, steel alloy combined with imbibed traces of arcite to strengthen it. Arcite ore forms in areas of high pressure before coming to the surface, so by theoretical understanding, the arcite ore itself should be highly durable.”

“What’s the fraction required?”

“That would have to be tested to determine the effective fraction, though I would suspect anywhere from two-hundredths to a tenth.”

Kyle did not have that much arcite ore to spare – his current production of arcite ore was barely enough to keep all of his buildings running currently, reliant on the mechanical regenerators to keep up coupled with a few regular purchases from the black market. Infusing the arcite ore into the steel would mean it cannot be regenerated. “I will provide the necessary testing material. Have this tested as well. Next?”

“Finally, we have discovered a unique bonding between Yul’s Tears and Greiss Powder with iron, that can potentially form a more durable and lightweight alloy compared to steel. However, this would be far longer to test.”

Yul’s Tears were exceptional expensive, and Kyle did not think he had the monetary capability now to attempt to corner the market. “Rejected, the metal’s cost would far outscale its worth. Leave it for a future investigation.”

Kyle next checked up on Team B, who were working on the layout of the armour. Not much improvements have been made, saved for a better freedom of motion in terms of the shoulders as well as the legs. The arcite fuel pack was still placed conspicuously at the back, though the designers had no idea how to minimize the size of that, seeing as they were not designing fuel packs.

For Team C, the rifle was already improving leaps and bounds from its original design, thanks to the reference engravings provided by the Oriental Bloom. Already, the first prototype of the rifle was available for Kyle to inspect.

MG404: [Item | Rifled Arctech Repeater | *A combination of genius and conformity.* | *Active Skill – Volley (Basic): Fires multiple projectiles as long as one holds down the trigger and has enough in the magazine. Cost per Activation: 2 MP per Projectile.*]

“Have you tested this?”

“Yes sir, Baron Cain provided one of his arctech knights to serve as a reference. He could fire the prototype up to 10 times before needing to swap a fuel pack. Without the fuel pack, he could fire 3 times, which is a significant improvement over the Oriental Bloom.”

“Not good enough. We need to design the rifle to be able to shoot 10 times without the fuel pack.”

“What?!” The team was in disbelief. “That’s physically impossible!”

“Is it? The Oriental Bloom would have been thought to be physically impossible just a year ago.”

The team did not have a rebuttal for Kyle, but still held a fair amount of reluctance and derision for the tall order. Kyle sighed, quickly sitting down and pouring over the sheets of engraving designs for the rifle.

“Look, over here. The placement of this cobalt bead is not properly amplifying the flow of arcite through the engraving, and the carbon blocks are not helping at all, instead causing the energy to be lost as heat and sound. If you just reroute it like this…” Kyle deftly sketched out a new engraving, his Arcia Engraver title’s put to good use. “Just this alone can reduce the arcia consumption by two-fold. Imagine what you could do with the rest of the engravings.”

Kyle didn’t hear a response, looking away from the drawing table only to see the team’s designers in utter shock at the skill that Kyle had just displayed, their head trying to reconcile the fact that such a young adult could show up even the most experienced among them. Their eldest designer quickly grabbed the new sketch, theories clashing and fighting for dominion in his head.

Kyle had other matters to attend to, so he left them to their confusion, checking up on the trade schools’ attendance. A few more students were enrolling, the classrooms now slowly filing up. However, it was still a depressing sight, especially considering that the trade school had been made free to attend. 

"Keith, expand the recruitment age range have the trade school work up a part-time plan for the students. Make sure the part-time plan is a adult living wage." Kyle ordered. This would provide an allowance of sort while bolstering the workforce in the factory.

"Even if the student is a child?" Keith questioned.

"Yes, especially if they are a child." The trade school was far more attractive to parents who were in dire need of money. Such families already had their children work in various other capacities in order to support their livelihood, so Kyle was confident that his plan could attract much more talents that were currently buried under poverty.

Keith worked quickly, creating a system where the students would work in the factory for four hours a day in the guise of 'hands-on' experience. The subsequent announcement and rumours were spread through the district, and before long there were a significant number of parents lining up to enroll their children into the trade school.

Yet this was not enough for Kyle. He knew this offering was not enough to truly exponentially grow his talent pool – he needed a wider reach in the long run. A way to put the district on the map of every citizen in Raktor. For now, he had to consider how else could he increase the number of workers in the new factory temporarily. His mind eventually landed on the new associates that had just joined the Seven Snakes since the Ilysian Punk War.

*I’ll have to put the new associates to good use.* He decided to head over to the original base, where the arcite ore training chamber had been set up. Originally the gang had only occupied the basement, but thanks to their recent expansion, they now controlled all five floors of the building. Kyle no longer had the original base set up as the HQ, having shifted all accounting and administrative matters to the shopping arcade for easier transportation.

Instead, the original base was now converted to one of five training centers, in which Damian and the older cobras and associates drilled the same physical training regimen into the new recruits. They were first processed here before being allowed to join the main team operating in the shopping arcade, effectively serving as a screening process of sorts.

“RUN YOU FUCKWIT! EVEN THE HOMELESS KIDS CAN RUN FASTER THAN YOU!” Damian yelled at the top of his lungs at a struggling new recruit, who was trying to sprint back and forth thirty times. “THINK JOINING THE SEVEN SNAKES IS A FUCKING GAME?!”

Kyle nodded in approval, Damian taking on a more serious approach to training ever since his brother was kidnapped by the Ilysian Punks. It was clear to the vipers that with the Seven Snakes current progress, they were bound to come into conflict with other gangs eventually, especially the Ardent Cretins.

*In peace, one always prepares for war.* Kyle scanned the floor, where various training exercises were carried out. In one part of the room, combat training was carried out in a similar fashion to how he had begun: by beating up prisoners captured for flouting the Seven Snakes rules, while older associates gave tips and real-life learnings on fighting. 

Kyle watched on as Damian personally demonstrated him wrangling a hobgoblin, taken directly from the Culdao Peaks. With the capture of the former rebels under Osir, Kyle had them put to good use as training dummies rather than letting Sahusa imprison them. *All lives are important to me, after all. Human or not.*

The hobgoblins provided a tougher challenge than the regular street fighters and enforcers, with their increased physical prowess and penchant for violence. As such, the prisoners were provided for training in levels of ascending difficulty: pickpockets, thugs, veterans, goblins, hobgoblins and evolved hobgoblins. 

The training routine seemed to progressing well, Kyle noticing a few bloodthirsty recruits who relished in the suffering they inflicted on the prisoners. He appreciated such an outlook on human life - the training regime was designed around honing that killer instinct in all recruits, able to kill on order. 

However, he soon noticed another new recruit hesitating against fighting a seemingly weak old prisoner, who was currently still sprawled on the floor and bleeding from the previous fight. The new recruit glanced at his compatriots, feeling the pressure, but yet did not want to hurt the prisoner any longer. 

Kyle squinted his eyes at the obvious hesitation, yet he did not think it was unexpected. The new recruits were largely small-time criminals or thieves with some semblance of a code of honor. However, if this impeded the operations of the Seven Snakes, Kyle had to nip it in the bud as soon as possible.

"What's wrong?" Kyle approached the group.

The new recruit and those around him instantly stiffened up, quickly bowing in respect. Everyone here knew exactly who Kyle was - his name was legendary through the districts for his prowess in both the Red Lion Skirmish as well as the Ilysian Punk War.

"Answer."

"Sir.. uhh... Boss! I... We've been beating him up for days on end now, and it's starting to feel repetitive." The new associate's eyes shifted suspiciously, hiding his true feelings which seemed to be shared with the rest of his training squad. 

"Repeititve... I see." Kyle nodded, brushing past the new associate towards the collapsed old prisoner. He checked the state of the prisoner, the blood loss obviously significant. *This is a problem.* "You there, get Damian here now."

Soon, Damian arrived, slightly out-of-breath from the recent demonstration he had just done. "Boss, you called?"

"The recruits are reluctant to attack humans. Do you see the same problem with goblins and hobgoblins?"

Damian glanced at the recruits all standing around aimlessly while the old prisoner bled to death, the recruits fidgeting like newborn chicks. "Not at all, boss. But I understand that they can't go the last mile. Many of the recruits were former small-time criminals, petty crime and all that. They still can't act on killing orders just yet."

"Indeed. They are still clinging to the ideals of civilian life. It would be good to have them familiarize with the extent that we are willing to operate."

"Understood. I can have them kill prisoners who are non-compliant."

"Not good enough. I want you to increase the intensity of the physical training regime. And have those capable ones spend sometime working at the weapons factory as well. Make sure they dont have time to think, get them to accept orders subconsciously. Then organize them into squads with cobras leading them, and have them go out on the streets to arrest people who flout our rules."

"Arrest people? You mean the thug rackets? Niko is already working on that, wouldn't it be overkill?"

"No. The veteran associates and cobras are already experienced enough with the Ilysian Punks war. Those who refuse or resist the training, mark them for immediate transfer to the training caves for desentiziation exercises. I will inform Monica on how to handle them."

"Yes, sir." Damian nodded without hesitation, immediately drafting up a new intense physical regime aimed at breaking their spirits. He did not question exactly what Monica and Kyle would do with them, but he had no doubts the recruits will no longer hesitate to act once they were done.

With the combination of part-time trade school students as well as a good number of recruits now working in the Aspis Weapons Factory, the total employment rate would be near 70%. Kyle needed a bigger push and a wider reach to fill the remaining gap. *I'll need to check my finances and options once more.*

Kyle observed the training for a bit longer, before heading to the shopping arcade to talk again with Keith, who was entertaining an somewhat expected visitor. He entered a meeting room, only to be met with three gruff men, their attire clearly that of the working-class, though their demeanour was posh and upright. 

"Ahem, fellow masters, apologies for the interruption, but this is Kyle of the -"

"The Seven Snakes, I know who he is." One of them cut Keith off. "Finally, someone worthy to discuss matters with instead of your undecisive bratty ass."

Kyle squinted as the other two sneered at Keith, who began to bubble with rage, only holding it back thanks to Kyle's presence. Kyle took a seat at the head of the meeting table with Keith now standing behind him. "I apologize, I was not made aware of any visits beforehand, so please do forgive me-"

"Spare us the pleasantries - you're just a ruffian posing like a business owner at best."

"Then you should be well aware of my capabilities."

"Which is nothing in front of the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths."

"Ah!" Kyle clapped his hands in realization. "Sorry, I thought I was talking to the Society of Buffoons. I had assumed the three of you were Master Foolish, Dull and Witless"

"What did you say?!" Master Foolish slammed the table. "My name is -"

"Now, due to my tight schedule, I have other matters to attend to. If you would like me to spare the pleasantries then please spare me the backtalk."

Master Foolish rose out of his chair, about to lambast Kyle only to be held down by Master Dull, who retrieved a stack of papers, sliding it infront of Kyle. "We're here to inform you that none of your factory workers are part of the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths. As you have been awarded a license by Baron Cain, deserved or not, it is under the Societies Act pushed forward by the Count that all workers in the industry are strongly encouraged to be a part of this Society."

"And why would it be my concern that the workers be a part of this society?"

"The Society ensures the qualification and working mannerisms of all its members as well as ensuring experience is paid for by fair wages. It also serves as a framework for your business to achieve optimum efficency and appeasment of any unrest or discontent against your management as a whole, by providing a platform to seek redress for accumulated grievances. Such a platform will help to maintain stability -"

*A craft union, effectively.* "And how 'fair' are the wages you ensure?"

"From our understanding, your workforce is largely made of unskilled labour. It is critical that you afford them additional wages to have them complete a mandatory training process over twelve years."

"Twelve years? We don't have twelve years." Keith retorted. 

"This is the average journey for an apprentice to a master within our Society. Anyone outside of this process cannot be qualified to be a proper weaponsmith."

"How much would the training process cost?" Kyle asked.

"100 rakels each week, not including their membership fee which also has to be borne by the owner himself, which in this case is you."

"Hmm... interesting. Thank you for the heads-up, you may leave now." Kyle motioned towards the door, Keith walking over to open it for them. 

Master Dull looked slightly stunned, before Master Foolish finally burst out in anger: "You idiot, this is not a suggestion - this is a mandatory requirement to be a weapons manufacturer in Raktor!"

"Mandatory? I see here at the very top of the paper that it is merely a recommendation co-signed by the four Barons and the Count. I don't see anything here that would legally force me to have me foot the bill for fees I never agreed to."

"If you don't pay this amount, you will earn the ire of every other qualifed weaponsmith in the city!"

"So be it - I never hired any of them either. You and I have nothing to do with each other."

"You-" Master Foolish started, but was once again held back by Master Dull, who seemed to be one of the more calculative ones. 

"Mr. Kyle, I presume you understand what would happen if some of your workers were to hypothetically join our Society? Their wages and fees must be borne by you."

Kyle gave a knowing smile. "I know how to handle my workers. Now, you will vacate the premise immediately, or any other 'hypothetical' scenarios you discuss can and will be consider as a direct threat and insult to my businesses. And I don't take threats lightly." 

The three masters glanced at each other, before making the collective decision to leave together. "You will reap what you sow." Master Witless warned before he left.

"Indeed. I'm looking forward to the profits." 

With the three masters gone, Keith let out a huge exasperated sigh. "Fucking scum, we already provide the workers with free housing and what not, and now they want us to foot the bill for their own society? What do they think we are, a charity?"

"Nevermind them, but have some members keep an eye on their movements. I want to know as soon as they try anything funny to our workforce. Stability in the factory is of the utmost importance." Kyle spoke to Keith as they left the meeting room, returning to the main office rooms where dozens of hired clerks ran numbers and managed the businesses. The bureaucracy within the Seven Snakes was now expanding quickly to account for the number of subsidiaries being established. 

“Give me the overview of our businesses now.” Kyle started in his private office while Keith closed the door behind him.

“Yes, sir. With the raw materials from the Culdao Peaks now being transported smoothly, our operating costs have dropped significantly by about half. However, hiring the technicians poses another burden on our budgeting. The trade-school is operating at a complete loss, and we will be able to only survive six months assuming no further increase in current revenue.”

“So we’re still burning money.”

“Yes, and if we recruit more than fifty arctech designers at the rate chosen, we will slowly eat into our savings. Right now, these calculations are the worst-case scenario, in which we are operating under the assumption that we will not get the military contract, nor will Baron Cain buy any of our standard rifles being produced in the training phase.”

Kyle was confident that his technology would beat the competition, but he was not sure if there would be enough political pressure to push Count Leon into signing a supply contract. This was something that Baron Cain had to take care of on his end. Yet Kyle did not put all his eggs in one basket, still having a potential escape route for every scenario. "Has any messenger from Versia come in yet?"

"Not that I know of. But if you're thinking of selling weapons to Versia, it would be just as dangerous as what the Ilysian Punks were attempting to do."

"Indeed it will be. A last resort of sorts." Kyle had backup plans to shift production to Versia if it really came down to it, barring future negotiations with Minister Dekar who he had talked with months before. Having no messenger come by with the war looming this close seemed a bit suspicious to him.

“Taking into account the grown crops coming in from the Culdao Peaks now, we can drastically suppress the price of food, making our area much more attractive. Already many market stall owners are moving over into the district.”

The population snowball effect was starting to kick off, with the foundational work that Kyle has laid beginning to come into fruition. By providing ample amentites and a sustainable cost of living, he could entice people to come, which would in turn attract more businesses to set up shop here to profit on the increased footfall and population.

However, there was an inescapable side-effect of all this: land prices. While Kyle was defacto leader of the underworld here, it did not mean he had unbridled control over every single piece of land.

Of course, if he had his way he could violently repossess most of the buildings in the area, creating his own dominion. Yet the entrenched landowners and minor nobility who still had a vested interest in the district would be a tough target to bully, mostly due to their close ties with the enforcers and with Baron Cain.

Illegally evicting them and stealing their land would worsen the peaceful truce that the Seven Snakes and the enforcers now had – it would be directly biting the hand of those who paid the budget of the enforcers through taxation and donations. Already him claiming the land deed from the weapons’ factory prior owner had stepped on some toes, angering the landowner associations, and it was only because of Baron Cain’s involvement that the repercussions were muted.

Kyle was not too worried about the land prices rising, but it would serve as a significant cost barrier to future expansion, limiting the number of housing projects and factories that he could potentially established as landowners would seek to profit off the rising speculation.

For now, the holdings under the Seven Snakes was an impressive portfolio, as Keith began to read off the status of each of them.

“The Lusty Arcian has expanded into multiple branches now, a total of five outlets all complete with their own fronts. We have embedded some branches in the basement of the housing complexes, providing door-delivery where possible.”

With direct control over the housing complex and the enforcers implicit approval, prostitution was in full swing, to be contained within the four walls of the towering apartments, affording easy access to vices. Not only brothels were set up there, but branchs of the Seductive Serpent as well as the Golden Snake Casinos were flourishing in the complex, creating a sort of haven away from the Sanctum of Yual.

This, along with the advertisement and the promise of job security, was what tipped the scales for many migrants and slum dwellers, willing to trade freedom to go under the protection of the Seven Snakes, integrating themselves into the economy.

“What about the Sliver Snakes?” Kyle queried.

“Reese is working on developing a mobile version, one with much smaller proportions to fit in the size of a palm if possible."

*Ah, a handheld camera.* “Good, that’s another potential profit line.”

“Yes, but it eats into our pool of qualified arctech engineers and designers.” Keith shook his head, pointing towards the recruitment list. “Lowering the threshold for who we hire is fine and all, but eventually we would be bottle-necked for every role like we are now, even with the students and associates working in the factory.”

“Then we will need to find more avenues of attracting workers to our districts.” Kyle knew the advertisement via the distributed lightthrowers was working wonders, but those were expensive to manufacture and maintain as well. Until a handheld projector or screen of sorts was cheaply available, it would be hard to reach a wider audience. He consider other possible methods of distribution. “What about arctech radios?”

“They are still fairly expensive and hard to manufacture as of now, with many only hearing them in coffee shops or Euria dens, where only the well-to-do might frequent.”

*Then perhaps in the future when we can make them cheaper.* “Then we are only left with the medium of writing. Do we have any printing presses in our vicinity?”

“There are a few small-time newspapers, though they are mostly local news and only boast a small readership. The larger ones are all from Tryas or under Count Leon. There is a few on Thresher Street that Reese has been using for the filming process.”

“Give me a list of those in our districts, I will work on it. How is the application rate for the trade school?”

“Abysmal. Many are unable to read and write, and frankly are not interested in learning to as well. They would rather do hard labour with their hands than educate themselves. To many of them, reading words is a bit of a chore and boring.”

Kyle tapped his arm, before a plan emerged in his mind. Keith knew that look on his face, only wondering to himself what shenanigans Kyle was going to pull to solve this problem again.
