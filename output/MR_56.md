 # Chapter 56 - Epilogue

A damp chill prickled through layers of thick hide, pulling a groan from deep within the cave. 

The groan echoed through the cave. 

Numerous eyes, crimson and flecked with gold, cracked open, revealing completely dark pupils that seemed to devour the faint light flickering through the entrance. 

It scanned the surroundings, taking the familiar stalactites and the dust motes that danced in the stale air. It inhaled subtly, not wanting the dust to crowd its senses, and noticed the mana— everywhere. 

Then, a tremor ran through its massive form. The prickling sensation that wasn’t pain but an unfamiliar pull towards… West. 

*Grrah!*

An animalistic noise left its mouth as the sensation resonated in the very core of its being, pushing against years of slumber. 

A flicker of an image, a flash of fire, and panicked human figures sparked in its mind. The vision of the settlement lingered a bit longer. The red eye narrowed. 

More and more visions passed through its mind and something in its head prompted him to move towards the west, to the settlement. It was a command worthy of its stature and its calling. 

A low growl rumbled through the cave, vibrating the very stones. Shadows stirred in the depths, responding with guttural rasps. 

They were smaller versions of the behemoth, scaled creatures with razor-sharp teeth and eyes that glowed like polished obsidian. They were its children, the ones it had birthed to spread the message of its rule. 

The massive head lowered, its voice reaching every little one as they looked at him with a deep hunger imitating the behemoth’s. "The slumber has been long," it rumbled. "But the gnawing hunger for dominance, it never fades. If anything, I feel more hungry! More powerful than before, ready to devour everything. A new power calls for us to rise and take our rightful place.” 

The smaller creatures stirred, a collective snarl erupting from their throats. They understood. They craved the taste of fear, the power that came from absolute terror.

A cruel smile, if a creature like this could be said to smile, stretched across the towering face. "Go then," it boomed. "Prepare the world for our arrival. Let them know the name of true terror again. Especially the humans."

A wave of excitement rippled through the chamber. Snarls turned into excited yips, clawed feet drumming against the stone floor. The smaller beasts surged towards the cavern entrance, a black tide of hungry anticipation.

The massive creature watched them go, its own muscles twitching with a long-dormant yearning. 

It stood straight in the cavern, the head reaching the ceiling. Its hands extended, and a low rumble erupted from its heart. Muscles spasmed when they tried to stretch, but after moving a little, it felt better than before. 

A bit long and it was going to rule this part of the forest again and now, its rule would stretch to the human land. 

The voice inside its head told him so. 

\*\*\*

In the dimly lit chamber atop the Archine Tower, a circle of robed figures huddled around a large pine table. 

The only light emanated from a single orb suspended in the centre, painting shadows behind the wall.

An air of hushed tension permeated the room, punctuated only by the rhythmic tapping of a single long fingernail against the polished surface of the table.

"Are you certain of this, Eldren?" rasped a voice, the speaker obscured by a voluminous hood. "Dead? Mage Actra, dead?"

Eldren, a gaunt figure whose skeletal frame seemed barely contained by his robes, cleared his throat. "The report is clear, Magus Veridia. Actra perished in a skirmish with Arzan. Apparently, he… transformed and attacked the Baron."

A ripple of incredulous snorts echoed around the table. No one could believe the report that was given to them. 

"Transformed?" scoffed another figure, tilting their head back to reveal a sliver of a sharp chin. "Into what, a particularly large toadstool? Don't insult our intelligence, Eldren."

“Into a monster.” Eldren’s voice came stern. “A winged one with claws. According to the report sent to us, the scent of dead mana was coming from him.”

Even though he couldn’t process what he had read, the fact that none of them believed it, made it rather frustrating. 

A murmur of arguments rose. "These reports about Arzan," another voice chimed in, "speak of barely scraping the second circle. He’s a new mage. Actra, while far from brilliant, could at least manage a decent fireball. This tale is as absurd as it is insulting."

Eldren, unfazed by their derision, laid out the details gleaned from the report. Each mention of Arzan's supposed prowess elicited another round of scoffs and dismissive chuckles.

Moreover, none of them even gave heed to the fact that Actra had transformed into a monster. 

"Second circle besting a veteran like Actra? I have heard better jokes from my grandson. It reeks of some elaborate fabrication," one mage declared, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Perhaps young Arzan has a talent for weaving fantastical stories."

“That could be a type of genius that Arzan could wield. Huh.” 

The room dissolved into a cacophony of disbelieving pronouncements. When the report of Actra's death had came up, they had dug up every report on Arzan. 

None of them had been particularly good as Actra considered him weak and foolish and after his awakening, things were simply more mysterious around him. 

“All these reports from Actra… In a sense, the final report can be true. It makes sense if Arzan had been developing his circles— but the question is, how exactly did he do that?” 

“I can’t think of a way. Actra’s mentions were mostly about his improvements, though the awakening is questionable as well,” another mage said while scratching his thin beard. 

Eldren shook his head. “As questionable as it is, Actra’s reports are proof that he did. Our focus should be rather on the deceased mage, not on the awakened fresher,” he said in a whisper. 

A sudden sharp crack echoed in the stillness, silencing the room. Magus Veridia slammed a bony fist onto the table, his black eyes looking 

"Silence!" she commanded, her voice surprisingly powerful for such a frail figure. 

“Things are strange. Still, a Mage of the Archine Tower had died. And one in service to a noble house. We need to look into everything thoroughly. The part about Actra turning into a monster is blasphemy against our Tower and if they can't prove it, I'm going to personally demolish this young lord territory, no matter what circle Mage he is.”

She leaned forward, her eyes glinting from beneath the shadows of her hood. “First of all, if we are all so curious about the truth of the report," she continued, her voice taking on a dangerous edge. "Why not summon this Arzan ourselves? Have him answer for himself. An interrogation at the Archine Tower seems fitting, wouldn't you agree?"

A tense silence followed. 

The Mages exchanged uneasy glances. The death of a fellow Mage was a serious matter, even if they doubted the specifics of this report. 

“That seems suitable, yes,” Eldren’s voice came true while he glanced at everyone, earning nods and hums. 

And so it was decided to send a summons to Arzan.
