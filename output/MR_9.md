 # Chapter 9

“Heat stones? This feels so… warm. I never heard of something like that before.” Francis asked, his eyes filled with curiosity as his gaze alternated between the stone and Kai.

His hands were on top of the Heat stone and he continued to feel the increment of temperature.

“It feels good, right?” Kai said, smiling.

It had taken a while, but he had finally managed to develop the Heat stone. It wasn't to the level of a high-quality one he remembered, but it was still good enough for daily use.

Just by the expression on Francis's face, he could tell that the Heat stones had worked as expected.

“It’s as if the sun is in my hand— in this weather, Lord Arzan! This stone… Where did you find it? Did you make it?” Francis asked, looking at the stone closely and holding it like it was some treasure.

Killian also closely inspected the glinting stone.

Withdrawing his eyes from it, he turned to look at Kai.

“Is this what you were doing with the Syphon stones, Lord Arzan?” He asked, looking at Kai with a strange expression.

“Yes, I have been working on them for the past few days,” he said, wondering how to explain it. “Well, what I basically did was take the Syphon stone, and then design its insides so that it would emit heat. It initially does what Syphon stones are supposed to do, and then, the mana it absorbs will be converted to heat, releasing it to the outside.”

He finished the explanation and took the stone in his hand.

He hid the parts about him enchanting the stone as it would start another conversation he didn't want to have with the servants around.

Fortunately, it looked like both Killian and Francis were impressed by the Heat stone and the warmth coming from it.

The latter looked to be contemplating something. His hand was on his chin as he stared at the Heat stone. After a few seconds, he raised his head to look at Kai.

“How many of these will Your Lordship be able to create within a day?” Francis asked and Kai immediately replied.

“Five a day. It took me some time to figure out the particulars. But I believe, in no time I will be able to create twice that,” Kai said, as he thought about how long things would take and calculated the amount of mana he had to put in. Since he had gotten the right seals to enchant the stones, he would be able to avoid any mishaps.

“With the heavy winter this year, we can sell these for quite a good amount and with that, we can pay back the debt.”

Francis and Killian both nodded at his words. Both their faces were filled with questions, but they seemed to agree with Kai's assessment of the Heat stone.

“How long do these last?” Killian inquired as he took the stone to his hand.

“They’ll last at least a year. Maybe a few weeks past that, but not more than that. So, we can keep the production going and sell them every year.”

Francis nodded. “I have a price for them in my mind, and if this works out, the debt will be gone in no time. In places like Kalaria City and the capital, these should go at record prices. We could even auction them off. I'm pretty sure nobles would pay a good sum to alleviate the cold.”

“They would,” Kai said. “Syphon stones aren't hard to get, so we would be able to make a decent profit off them.”

“Yes, we sure will.”

Francis said with a satisfied look on his face.

“Lord Arzan, how did you even manage to develop something like this?” Killian’s voice came out doubtfully. His stare at Kai was deep and stern. Or maybe it was how he usually looked at people. “The designs on this… They looked like they were seals. I saw an enchanted sword once and they had similar-looking symbols on it.”

Francis immediately took note of the seals on the Heat stone as he narrowed his eyes.

“Seals? Do you mean the language of-” Francis started to speak, but stopped as he saw a guard walking towards them.

“Pardon me, Lord Arzan, Knight Killian, and administrator Francis… But there’s an immediate situation that needs your attention,” the guard said, bowing to Kai before looking straight at them.

“What is it?” Kai asked immediately.

“A merchant from the Tradeheart merchant company was creating a ruckus wanting to meet you. He was planning to walk to the breakfast table himself, but we kept him in the room on the first floor. He's waiting for you there.”

Both Killian and Francis exchanged looks at each other and stood up. Neither of them were done with their breakfasts, but there were important matters to deal with.

It hadn't been a week, but it seemed like the merchant had decided to give an early visit.

“Let’s go there, immediately,” Killian said and walked out of the hall.

Kai and Francis, both followed him without another word.

*I was wondering when they would show up.*

Kai sighed as he followed. Francis had gone pale beside him and even Killian didn't seem like his usual self.

If he hadn't developed the Heat stone, Kai might have been worried too, but with it in his hands, there was no reason to worry.

They took the stairs to the first floor and the guard showed them the room the merchant was sitting in.

As soon as Kai entered the room, he was met with a bald man with average-looking features who gave him a half-hearted bow.

He wore a red cloak to protect him from the wind and below it, Kai could see a velvet tunic. All of his clothes looked to be made of fine material and intricate patterns.

Either the man was one of the executives in the merchant company or the company was just wealthy enough for even common merchants to be well off.

Besides him, two men in leather armour stood, looking like hired warriors. Both of them had swords sheathed in their hilts and were as tall as Killian.

Kai gestured to the merchant to take a seat on the sofa. The two bodyguards stood on each side of them and both of his retainers did the same.

“Lord Arzan, it's so good to see you after so long. How long has it been? Six months?”

The merchant asked and Kai simply nodded, not wanting to get into past matters since he had no memory of it.

“Why don't we start with the reason you are here?” He asked and the merchant's expression strained.

He soon smiled and began talking.

“I'm pretty sure you know my reason for visiting. It's to take the debt back," he said, giving a smile that reminded Kai of swindlers. "We've been patient, but the due date is long gone. You see, the Tradeheart merchant company values honesty and punctuality."

“I tried to discuss this with you before Galvan, but we are in no position to pay that amount of money, and you said you would give us a week,” Francis said, frowning.

The merchant shook his head. “I am here early because of a reason and does it even matter? The condition of the city isn't hidden from anyone and a few days here and there wouldn't change that.”

Kai stood silent, listening intently. Killian simply glared at the man and Francis looked to be lost for words.

The bald man, Galvan swept his gaze across them and took it as a consensus to keep going.

He continued, “Since you have been asking for more time, I have an alternative way for you to pay rather than in coins. We have prepared an agreement for you to hand over a part of the farmlands and one of the mines to us. I know that there are pesky bandits around, but the Tradeheart merchant company could handle them. It would also bring more security to your land. If you will, I will show the agreement to you.”

As the words left his mouth, Kai wondered for a second how Arzan would have reacted to it. Maybe he would be angry and lash out? It was hard to say.

Galvan kept his smiling moniker, but the words he spewed were enough to be considered more than rude.

“Go on,” Kai said, letting him continue.

He noticed how visibly uncomfortable Francis seemed to be next to him. He was shifting from one leg to another, and tapping on his elbow constantly.

“Now hold on. You can’t just ask for something like—”

Kai lifted a hand, interrupting his train of words. “Let him finish.”

Galvan nodded to him and quickly took out a set of documents from under a bag. He passed it on to Kai. “We’ve ensured it’s all perfectly legal and per the agreement.”

“This isn’t fair! We’ve been giving interest. You need to give us more time!”

Francis shouted out, glaring towards Galvan.

“It's not about that, Francis. An agreement is an agreement and the one Lord Arzan signed, clearly states that he needs to pay the whole debt in six months. He failed to do so, so it's within our right and the law of the land.”

As Galvan continued talking, Kai calmly picked up the agreement and went through it. It wasn't big and it seemed simple enough with all the right clauses.

Tradeheart merchant company would get the right to the mine for ten years and the farmlands indefinitely and in return, the debt would be over.

He was sure that they were planning to run the mine dry so that after ten years, there would be nothing left.

“Lord Arzan, you can take your time with it and sign it at your—”

“No, I don't think I will,” he said, interrupting Galvan. “I don't think you realise it, but your company is violating Lancephil law.”

He finished his sentence calmly and looked at Galvan who looked baffled. His words seemed to be stuck in his throat for a second.

“What?” He asked. “Lord Arzan, this isn't the time for these sorts of things. I know you are playful, but this is a serious matter.”

“I’m serious, Galvan,” Kai said. “I'm pretty sure a merchant such as you would be well-versed in the kingdom's laws.”

“I'm, but I don't see how we are violating it here. The agreement was by it.”

The confusion on his face was a sight to see. Even Killian and Francis looked the same, but they tried their best to keep their faces neutral.

Kai put the agreement back on the table and smiled.

“The agreement is under the laws. I agree with that.”

“Then?”

“There’s just one thing you haven't given heed to or you won't be here today.”

“What?”

Silence filled the room for a few seconds as Kai thought back to the exact words he had read back in the library. Fortunately, among the history and geographical books, there was a book with the kingdom's laws written on it.

“According to the kingdom’s law, nobles like me have a provision. We can ask for an additional six months without any interest to pay back any loan we take. You can read section B, clause A in the 848th Lancephil Law that was first used in Year 790, and it is still in practice.”

The confidence in Kai's voice was clear and loud as he spoke. Galvan's smile faded away and he looked to be wondering if Kai had been lying or not.

“Are you sure… of it, Lord Arzan?” He asked, his voice breaking.

“Yes, I read it. You can check it. I won't lie to you.”

He gave a similar smile to Galvan that he had plastered on his face before. Kai had looked for a law book after knowing about the debt since nobles would often fall into the traps of merchants and even other nobles.

So, most of the time, kingdoms would have separate laws to give them one last chance.

In Lancephil Kingdom, it had come into practice almost a hundred years back when a Count had almost lost everything to a merchant and then, the king of those times had helped him out by giving him additional time.

Now, it has saved Kai.

Galvan’s face changed and he barely kept his smile.

“This goes against what we agreed upon, Lord Arzan! You can't just do that” he said and gritted his teeth.

“I’m just staying within my legal rights. I'm pretty sure you and Tradeheart merchant company take the law very seriously.”

Galvan didn't speak and just nodded. Kai could see his clenched hands beyond his cloak. The man always knew how to put a smile on his face, but was bad at hiding his anger.

“After six months, I would be happy to sign that agreement,” he said. “If it comes to that.”

Kai stood up, hoping to end the meeting. It was then that one of the towering bodyguards stepped forward. His face was scrunched up in frustration and anger.

“You can't back out now! Sign the agreement!”

Without even thinking further, the bodyguard started making his way towards Kai. He walked around the round table—but before he could do anything, Killian walked to the front of Kai.

Kai’s vision was blocked by Killian’s large body.

“If you don’t sign this—” the bodyguard's loud voice filled the air as he started lunging himself forward.

Kai swiftly cast a spell to make the ground slippery beneath the bodyguard, which caused him to lose his footing and stumble. It wasn't a flashy spell, so he doubted anyone saw it.

“What the…?” The bodyguard’s confused voice came from the floor as he slipped.

His huge body lost its balance and he fell with a thud, looking embarrassed.

Killian glared at Galvan, then the bodyguard.

“If you want to conduct yourself as thugs, the Tradeheart merchant company would be thrown out of the territory and I would personally kill you for attacking Lord Arzan,” he said, holding a sword towards him.

“I apologise, Lord Arzan,” Galvan quickly said. “He has got quite the temper. This bastard doesn't know how to behave.”

With a frown, he looked at the bodyguard who lifted himself. “I will excuse myself, for now, the kingdom’s laws are something me and Tradeheart merchant company respect and do not plan to cross. I hope to see you again, Lord Arzan.”

His frown deepened, but he didn't dare stay any longer.

Giving a death glare to his bodyguard, he left the room. The towering bodyguards followed the merchant outside.

Once they were gone, Kai took a sigh of relief.

Killian and Francis both took steps forward to walk closer to Kai. The latter’s face was filled with a big question.

“How did Your Lordship know about that?”

Kai looked at Francis and responded, “I found a book on the laws and went through it. I just wanted to find something that’d leverage us.”

“I know the basic laws, but something like this was never taught to me,” Francis muttered, looking ashamed of himself.

“You should take a look at a few books in the library.”

Kai said and stretched his hands.

“I will, Lord Arzan. With this, we have six months to pay off the debt. I think we would be able to with the Heat stones,” he said with a big smile on his face.

On the other hand, Killian seemed to be contemplating something. Looking at Kai, he hesitated before speaking again. “Lord Arzan, I don't know if I saw it right, but did you cast a spell there?”

“What?” Francis stared at him.

“I felt a rush of mana behind me,” he explained, looking at Kai who hadn't expected that.

*It seems like he can sense mana.*

Deciding to ask more questions about it later, Kai put his palm head and conjured up a small flame on top of it.

There was no better moment to reveal it.

Smiling, he glanced at the shocked gazes of both of them, “Yes, I'm a Mage.”

\*\*\*

Galvan stormed out of the estate. His expression was a mix of frustration and resentment as he gritted his teeth.

His footsteps echoed through the courtyard as he briskly walked away, leaving the estate behind.

Once at a sufficient distance from the estate, the merchant turned to his imposing bodyguard, a bitter scowl etched across his face.

“This is just infuriating… I can’t believe we had to leave that place without a signed agreement. Those nobles think they can just use their laws to bend everything in their favour,” he said, shaking his head. “And you, we aren't dealing with a normal noble. It's a Duke's son here. No matter what, his one drop of blood is still more valuable than your head. From next time, if you do something like that, I will make sure you suffer for it.”

The bitterness was layered on every word he said. The bodyguard nodded, keeping his head low. He had just made a fool of himself and knew better than to talk back.

Finally, Galvan dismissively waved his hand. Frowning, he gave one last look at the estate, "Forget this. We'll play along for now, but after six months, when the extension is over, we'll get everything as initially planned. Just make sure you keep a close eye on the estate. Those fools won't know what hit them. Especially that useless Arzan.”

He said while getting on his carriage. The bodyguards simply nodded as they followed behind.
