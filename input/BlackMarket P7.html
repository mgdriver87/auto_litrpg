<p></p><p><strong>Chapter 90 - Radicals</strong></p><p>The atmosphere was tense, as Gunther heaved a bag full of pellets and rifle parts into a dusty corner, panting slightly while he tried to catch his breath. His other followers who escaped with him were equally exhausted, some collapsing onto the floor of the derelict hideout room, the door locked tightly behind them.</p><p>His followers were composed of those who knew the real inner workings of the union, those who were loyal to Gunther. Many had participated in the executions and beheadings themselves, using the union as a means to bring their shared vision into reality. However, this setback had them reeling. No one spoke a word as they reorganized their stuff, Gunther himself boiling with frustration as to what had happened. &quot;Where is Long Hua? He should have been here before us. Did he leave?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No sir, the hideout was completely untouched when we first arrived.&quot; One of his followers answered him. &quot;The door was still locked exactly the same way we left it.&quot;</p><p>Gunther cursed under his breath, wondering what happened before the leader of the strike force entered the hideout along with another small group of workers, having just escaped the Seven Snakes district. It was painfully obvious from the look on their faces that not everyone had made it out of the ensnaring net.</p><p>&quot;What the hell happened, Ki Hwang?&quot; Bronco pressed as he stormed up to Gunther, asking the question that had been on everyone's mind for the last few hours that they had been running. &quot;We had control of the whole union! We could have fought off anyone who was coming to capture us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not when the union council has been corrupted.&quot; Gunther seethed. &quot;Those spineless compromisers, they were planning to round all of us up at the morning council meeting!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who else? The fucking cocksuckers who spent their time at the Seven Snakes pub and casino every night these past few weeks!&quot; Despite Gunther's external show of disdain and anger, internally he was far from furious about the betrayal of Culo and the others. He had never expected them to really be on the same page as him, even with all their talks of unity and solidarity.</p><p>He used them just as much as they used him – a true revolutionary never held any qualms about human morals or relationships. As Gunther looked around the temporary hideout, he was buoyed by the fact that he had already grown his original loyal following to a near hundred now, armed to the teeth with military-grade weapons and armor pilfered from the factory stores at no additional cost.</p><p>&quot;Fucking traitors...&quot; Bronco gritted his teeth, kicking a nearby crate. &quot;We lost our power - reduced to a skeleton of what we could have been! The whole factory! It could have been the start of something fresh, a true revolution! &quot;</p><p>&quot;And it still can be. We still have multiple stores of weapons and supplies to continue the fight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then we should hit the Seven Snakes as soon as possible. The moment they drop their guard-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. It's all a ploy by that accursed Kyle.&quot; Gunther clenched his fist. &quot;He knew exactly what was going to happen, and he played us all for fools!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean? How is that possible?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I felt it the moment he instantly agreed to all our demands as if he was already expecting it to happen. The council may have already been infiltrated even earlier.&quot; Gunther began to pace the hideout, checking all of their remaining food and water. <em>Perhaps even Culo was on their side from the beginning.</em></p><p>&quot;You're right, it was strange for us to have successfully rescued all of the prisoners without a single casualty. But I don't understand, what is the overall motive?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It does not matter - as long as we still live, the revolution lives on through us. Gather everyone who has proved their loyalty once they are settled in. Contact Wrent and inform him of what happened.&quot; Gunther ordered Bronco.</p><p>While Bronco rallied the men, Gunther was not as disinterested as he seemed in Kyle's motive, trying to compile everything he knew. As he watched his men scurry about, reorganizing the hideout once more, it was like lightning striking the ground when the pattern began to emerge in his brain, the path obvious to him.</p><p>It was already clearly obvious that controlling the union was the desired outcome for the Seven Snakes, and it had been achieved through the corruption of his allies, but it failed to explain just why they did not crush the union outright. <em>If they were able to capture Guang Hwa so easily, then there was an underlying reason why they did not capture me yet.</em></p><p>Gunther knew he was the highest profile target - for all his disguises and machinations, he had no doubt Kyle would have captured him instantly the moment he was revealed. <em>Which means I still served a purpose, up to today.</em></p><p>As what was left of the workers continued to reorganize their equipment, Gunther spotted Bronco's hand shivering slightly, Bronco taking out a smoke pipe and stuffing a few grounded Euria Seeds. &quot;Since when did you smoke?&quot; Gunther squinted in suspicion.</p><p>&quot;I...&quot; Bronco himself wasn't quite sure. &quot;I just saw this among the stash of the factory managers, seemed about right to use it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don't look too well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm fine, I'm perfectly fine. What, you going to tell me I can't smoke now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not.&quot; Gunther didn't particularly care about Euria smoke, it was just another hobby to him. Yet he saw quite a few people smoking as well within the hideout, the distinctive blue plumes wafting to the ground as it calmed the nerves of those inhaling it, relaxing the tension a little as they tried to come to terms with the loss.</p><p>&quot;Hey, there's an announcement by the union on the radios!&quot; One of the men remarked, tuning the radio only to earn a slap in the head from Bronco.</p><p>&quot;What fucking use do we have to listen to the traitors? Fuck all of them!&quot; Bronco reached forward to grab the radio, but Gunther stopped him.</p><p>&quot;No. To know our next move, we need to know our enemies. Play it.&quot;</p><p>[-And the union will no longer tolerate those who seek to undermine and threaten the stability of society. The union is committed to ensuring peace and prosperity, for those who are willing to put in the effort. We now represent all workers in the district, if you choose to join us, in working hand-in-hand with the enforcers and the business owners.] Culo's voice rang clearly through the hideout, antagonizing Gunther's followers who were listening in.</p><p>&quot;Fucking bitches! They compromised with the landlords and the Seven Snakes! They betrayed the workers!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gunther, we should go in and kill all of them. The only thing worse than a landowner is a traitor!&quot;</p><p>Gunther's followers were already seething, shouting over the announcement until Gunther raised his hand, earning a silence while Culo continued to speak.</p><p>[Our former leader, Gunther, has been revealed to be the mastermind behind the beheadings and executions, attempting to frame others. The union vehemently denounces all forms of violence and offensive actions, and are purely committed to a peaceful negotiation with all business owners. We do not seek revolution, but reformation. Together, we can all work towards a better future, hand-in-hand without conflict. In order to do so, we have implemented a few changes to the union.]</p><p>&quot;FUCK YOU CULO! NO CHANGE WITHOUT STRENGTH!&quot; One of Gunther's followers hollered, earning a wave of agreement and shouting.</p><p>&quot;Disgusting slimeballs who suckle their masters' toes!&quot; Another heckled. &quot;And I bet the first change they did was to rescind the double wages.&quot;</p><p>[As such, effective from today, the union will be enforcing new rules and legislation to ensure the well-being of every worker of the union. First and foremost, double wages of the current prevailing market rates are in place, to be revised every three years under a progressive scheme.]</p><p>&quot;What?!&quot; Gunther's followers were befuddled beyond belief, their anger overridden by confusion. Many of them turned to look at Bronco and Gunther, only to see that the two were equally flabbergasted as well.</p><p>As Culo continued elaborating on the changes, it became painfully clear that all of the benefits that the union had earned were not going away at all. Bronco pulled Gunther to the side angrily: &quot;This runs contrary to every other business owner we have dealt with before. What is the Seven Snakes even aiming at?! How are they sustaining double the market rates?! And to even suggest that it would be revised regularly? If anything, Kyle should have crushed the union instantly to save costs!&quot;</p><p>Gunther's eyes flickered to the pipe still in Bronco's hand, the realization striking him. &quot;You, you and the other prisoners. You're addicted to the Euria smoke, aren't you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? How does that matter now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The workers left behind, they are fueling their addiction by buying drugs from the damned Seven Snakes. The money never ever leaves their system, it just circulates! That's how they are funding the double wages because the workers are going to spend it on them anyway!&quot;</p><p>Bronco started to come around a little but was still a bit confused. &quot;But they still need money to produce the drugs, it can't be that profitable for them! The resources, the workers needed…&quot;</p><p>[Finally, for workers who have suffered financial difficulties, we are proud to also consecutively announce a loan program with low interest rates from the Golden Snakes Construction Company in order to cover your expenditure. This offer is unique to workers within the union only!] Culo's final change had a resounding applause on his side of the radio, but Gunther's followers were deathly silent in the hideout.</p><p>At this stage, Gunther didn't need to bicker any longer, Kyle's plan laid bare for all to see. &quot;He's milking them dry through never-ending interest. If they are as addicted as you, they would spend their entire wage on every single drop of Euria they can get their hands on, even going into debt!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then they will be forever indentured to the Seven Snakes,&quot; Bronco concluded as he tossed his Euria pipe to the side in disgust. &quot;All while the workers think they are protected and supported by the union. He played us like puppets!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like puppets indeed.&quot; Gunther clenched his fist in anger. <em>First the Red Lions, now the Seven Snakes. I had enough of being used as a pawn!</em></p><p>The announcement ended, leaving Gunther's followers waiting for an answer while they bickered among each other, some reconsidering whether following Gunther was the right thing to do or not. &quot;Maybe if we had just compromised, we would have been able to achieve something greater. Culo is doing exactly what a union should be doing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you crazy? The union should have zero diplomacy with the business owners - don't forget the Seven Snakes imprisoned and experimented on our brothers. They treat us worse than cattle!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's right, no quarter should be given!&quot;</p><p>&quot;But Kyle gave in to all of our demands!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That means he just has an ulterior motive. It's clear he is the ultimate beneficial owner of the union now, pulling all the strings. Who is to say that he won't twist it for his own nefarious means in the future!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It does not matter what he wants, or why he wants it.&quot; Gunther interjected, stepping into the very center of the hideout. &quot;What matters is that the union under Culo has lost their path. They have become enchanted, led astray by the naive belief that working with those who seek to own us would ever lead to a positive outcome. This is only a false cover, an illusion to make it seem like the Seven Snakes is walking the path of moderation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the fact is, the workers did get a better job and safer working conditions.&quot; One of the more hesitant followers pointed out.</p><p>&quot;Then inform me, and the rest of us here: who put them into that situation in the first place? Who created the working environment from scratch? Molded it, designed it? Was it us?&quot;</p><p>“Those above us who have forgotten their roots.&quot; Bronco and a few others chanted in response.</p><p>&quot;Culo and the traitors paint us as radicals, as extremists who only know violence. We have lost our base of power, our support, our former brothers and comrades. But when our suffering and pain is inflicted through violence, what other recompense do we have? Does a pig bend the knee in order to prevent being slaughtered? Does a dog not fight back when others seek to maim it? And when ur fellow chickens sprint for the ovens, shall you follow them? No! We will fight, fight for our right to get what we deserve from those who seek to rip that away from us!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And so they shall return to dust.&quot; More began to join the chant.</p><p>&quot;The business owners establish their rule through the use of force, in the form of enforcers or gangsters. Thus, the use of force is necessary to overthrow said rule! There is no other alternative, no other compromise. A revolutionary does not maim himself in search of a better future, he struggles and fights with every ounce of energy within his veins, within his muscles. And while he may not live to witness the future, he knows that it is what must be done in the present, in the here and now. For great men suffer for a goal that they may never see realized in their lifetime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So our children can be reborn anew.&quot; The followers were starting to come together, united under a banner.</p><p>&quot;To a better world, a world without exploitation, servitude, a world without class, a world without nobles and their ilk, a world without suffering nor pain, where every man, woman and child will be afforded his due rights according to his true ability rather than the nature of his birth.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So our world will be made united.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This setback is but a minor dip, but it only hardens our resolves and threshes the dregs from our cause. Here we remain united, stronger than ever in our bonds. Those traitors do not deserve our help, nor will they receive our sympathy. No longer shall we run, no longer shall we hide.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For men of equal shall inherit the world!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gather everyone who is willing to fight for the cause, to fight for the freedom that we all had ripped away from us the moment we were born into this cruel society. Recruit the lost, the forsaken, the downtrodden, and rise up! Rise up stronger than ever before, rise up burning with vengeance in your heart, soul and mind! The revolution can be only be paved in blood, for all men are equal!&quot; Gunther roared at the top of his lungs.</p><p>&quot;And so they will die equal!&quot;</p><p>@@@</p><p>The galloping of horses thundered across the tracks, only matched by the never-ending shouts and cheers from the audience. Many of them clutched slips of papers in their hands, their hearts palpitating in line with each gallop the horses took.</p><p>[Angel's Venture is leading the pack right now, but Team Crimson is catching up really fast; it looks like it's coming down to the wire!] An upbeat announcer's voice belted out commentary through the various arctech radio speakers mounted on the ceiling of the stands, invigorating the audience even more.</p><p>[AND UNBELIEVABLE! TEAM CRIMSON IS THE WINNER BY JUST THE TIP OF ITS NOSE!]</p><p>&quot;THAT'S BULLSHIT!&quot; An angry audience member wagged a clenched fist in the air. &quot;THEY WERE CHEATING!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sit down, old man, you just betted on the wrong horse!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck you!&quot;</p><p>As the audience broke out into an equal mix of cheers and tears, an entourage of Red Lion bodyguards surrounding a VIP lounge area showed no emotion at all, much less the man that they were protecting. Unlike the usual florist apron he wore at his shop, he wore a prim and proper suit with red accents along the edges, a touch of purple nested in his breastpocket along with golden tipped shoes. Despite the cacophony of misery and ecstasy at the result of the race, the man was focusing far more on the words that were being whispered to him.</p><p>&quot;There has been no contact with Wrent since the announcement by the union. We suspect the Seven Snakes may have captured him.&quot; A Red Lion officer reported to Leo who was still staring intently at the chaos unfolding in the stands. An eerie silence reigned in the air, the officer's leg shivering slightly while he watched Leo's every movement.</p><p>&quot;I don't want suspicions, I want information. Do they have him or not?&quot; Leo spoke with an icy tone, his anger clear as day.</p><p>&quot;His last known movement was to secure an informant of the name Guang Hwa, who used to be the CEO of the Golden Snakes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then it's likely our motives and plans have been compromised. The Seven Snakes must be aware of our plans. How fast can we move?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're not done with the distribution of weapons and armor collected by Wrent. It would take a day or two to have every leader and their district geared up again.&quot; The officer reluctantly informed, risking earning the ire of Leo. However, he would rather not end up like Wrent - honesty was the best policy when it came to the Red Lions.</p><p>&quot;Mock up a reduced attack plan with a smaller strike force. Once approved, distribute it to all leaders for execution. Who's left in the Left Paw?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The next ranking member is Lionel, boss.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have him assume the position of the Left Paw.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But boss, Wrent might still be alive. If we replace him now, it would go against years of tradi-&quot;</p><p>Leo glared at the officer. &quot;Regardless of whether or not Wrent is alive, he is a dead man to us. I do not tolerate failure twice. Carry out the promotion, effective immediately.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Understood, boss.&quot;</p><p>Leo sighed, adjusting a leather gauntlet that masked his entire left forearm. &quot;The attack must be lightning quick. Have Lionel take over from Wrent for the Left Paw. I will take command as soon as the strike force is organized. We must burn every Seven Snakes business to the ground before they can fortify their defenses.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course-&quot; A sudden gunshot interrupted them from the front of the stands, the audience collectively shouting in unison, Both Leo and the officer immediately exchanged suspicious glances. &quot;Who's in charge of security here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll ring him up.&quot; The officer quickly tuned the arctech radio strapped to his belt, only to met with static.</p><p>&quot;Mobilize anyone who is still remaining. We will immediately retreat to our nearest hideout.&quot; Leo motioned with his hands, having the entourage move in tandem with him, forcing their way through the panicking crowd.</p><p>As the bodyguards pushed and shoved the audience members aside in a bid to get to the exit, a sudden glint of metal flashed into Leo's eyes, the sharp blade of a knife gutting an unaware bodyguard from amidst the crowd. &quot;They are onto us!&quot; The Red Lion officer cried out, drawing his handgun and scanning the crowd for the hidden assailant.</p><p>Even Leo couldn't tell who was the enemy and who was just a fleeing audience member. &quot;Clear out the crowd, NOW!&quot;</p><p>The bodyguards complied, firing into the air and forcing the innocent audience members to scatter away from them suddenly. But before some of the bodyguards could react, they were immediately met with a barrage of pellets, most of which tore through their steel plates like a hot knife through butter, butchering their organs in a mist of blood.</p><p>Leo ducked low while he was escorted out of the racing arena, pellets zinging in the dense air when a sudden explosion rang in the distance as others screamed and ducked, running for cover while smoke billowed from the nearby factories.</p><p>&quot;Who's attacking us?&quot; Leo demanded, but the bodyguards around him were far too preoccupied to identify their allegiance. Only from the corner of his eye did he spot the silhouette of the assailants, though it was not enough to determine who it was.</p><p>As the firefight continued, the Red Lion bodyguards fell one by one in their attempts to bring Leo to a safehouse along the wide streets filled with panic and devastation. They cowered behind smoking husks of arctech wagons and toppled billboard signs, firing back randomly at the general direction of the enemy.</p><p>&quot;Boss, we're going to make a run for it over into that clothes shop and hole up until further reinforcements come - you two cover us!&quot; The Red Lion officer barked, Leo complying and sprinting as fast as he could under suppressive fire.</p><p>Soon, they were in the still pristine shop filled with silk and luxurious cloths draped on rails and manniquins, the workers frantically hiding in the safety of their counter. &quot;Get into the back!&quot; The Red Lion officer waved his handgun frantically, forcing the workers into the storeroom behind while Leo himself began to shift a few display cabinets towards the door, shoring it up before taking stock of what they had on hand.</p><p>&quot;Boss, you can have my handgun.&quot; The officer offered it to Leo, only to be rejected.</p><p>&quot;I have my ways of defending myself. Get in contact with the other members, have them encircle the enemy now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But if you use it, your body will not be able to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did I ask you to question me?!&quot; Leo snapped, prompting the officer to hurriedly tune the arctech radio, trying to hail the other Red Lions.</p><p>Another explosion reverberated through the shop, the mannequins rattling violently along with the flimsy glass pane that shielded their storefront. Leo could only watch as his bodyguards were pinned down under the sheer firepower of their attackers unable to stop them at all.</p><p>Suddenly, he noticed another glint of metal from a second-floor window opposite the store, a strange looking spearheaded projectile aimed right at him. His muscles tensed as he instinctively lunged towards the officer, dragging him down onto the floor.</p><p>Within a split second, the projectile had launched forward, billowing a dazzling green trail of gas before shattering the storefront's glass pane and smashing a mannequin in its way, lodging itself into the fake wooden flooring of the fashion store.</p><p>Leo struggled to rise to his feet, while the far more sturdy Red Lion officer attempted to hoist him up. However, a sudden churning sound erupted from the strange projectile, heralding a thousand sharp fragments of metal to explode with force. The fragments ricocheted across the store, damaging and shredding the various strips of cloth apart while the officer took the brunt of the shrapnel for Leo, using his own body to block. A stray fragment dug into Leo’s leg, the burning sensation cutting through his calf as the officer collapsed to the floor half-dead, his body still twitching slightly.</p><p>Leo hurriedly scrambled towards the counter at the far end of the shop, taking cover behind the sturdy wooden walls of a wardrobe while a squad of five union fighters stormed the entrance, hacking and kicking apart the temporarily placed display cabinets. &quot;So those above us remember their roots.&quot; The squad leader chanted, motioning for the others to sweep the store.</p><p>&quot;And so they shall return to dust.&quot; They responded, hoisting their rifle to bear, carefully stepping over the pieces of broken mannequins and torn trails of clothes billowing amidst the smoke and devastation of the</p><p>&quot;No use hiding, Mane of the Red Lion. No one shall stand above the union any longer!&quot; The leader of the union squad taunted. &quot;Come out, and we may grant you a quick death.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fools, I was the one who funded you! I supported your cause!&quot; Leo roared from behind the cover, his eyes darting about as he searched for a way out.</p><p>&quot;I would be a fool to believe your words - you imprisoned Gunther and my brothers too! No doubt you had nefarious means for us, using us to your own benefit. We will no longer be your puppets!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then you leave me no choice,&quot; Leo grunted with effort, removing his leather gauntlet on his left forearm to reveal a wretched, shriveled black hand, from which a sickening red gas began to seep out of every pore, snaking through the debris like tendrils that sought out the fighters.</p><p>Before any of the workers could react, the tendrils of gas had spiraled up into the air, coiling like snakes and drilling right into their noses, their harrowing screams filling the air as their bodies were hoisted and flung through the store, their skin ravaged by multiple lacerations from the various sharp glass fragments around.</p><p>The squad leader was frightened, hurriedly firing as many pellets as he could muster at the incoming tendrils. Yet the pellets had no effect on the gas, only forming swirling holes of fumes as it passed through harmlessly. Three tendrils lunged towards him, two of them grabbing his two arms and locking him down to the ground, while the last one jabbed right into his eyes, his eyes squished into a pulp as blood streamed down his face.</p><p>Blood began to pulsate, swirling back through the tendrils towards Leo's hand, his original shriveled blackened skin beginning to regain its original color and skin tension as though it was freshly grown, the surface supple as a child’s. In exchange, the workers' body began to decay rapidly, the flesh deflating like a balloon as the life was sucked right out of them.</p><p>The leader still struggled while Leo walked towards him, confident as ever as a deadly red aura surrounded him. Without a single word, Leo flicked his finger upwards; the tendril that had latched onto the leader's eyes began to pull even harder, turning the leader's face inside out in a gruesome form, the red raw flesh within brought to the surface in a twist of skin and meat.</p><p>The tendrils dropped the leader, leaving Leo alone in a sea of carnage as he stepped over the desiccated corpses, heading out into the street where a squad of Red Lions were already rushing over to him. &quot;Boss, are you alright?&quot; The first started, only to see the bodies behind Leo as the answer to his question.</p><p>Leo ignored the concern of the member, instead ordering the Red Lions to launch a counterattack on the union immediately. &quot;The union has far outlived their usefulness - it's time to cull the herd.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 91 - To The Table</strong></p><p><em>Three days later...</em></p><p>The Red Lions districts were a veritable sea of chaos and fire, flames licking up from every other window as firebombs, firefights and bloody stains dominated the streets unlike never before. Sounds of gunfire and screams rang out through the debris-ridden alleyways and back lanes, buffeting the whimpers and muffled cries of those seeking shelter however they could.</p><p>Clashes between the Red Lions and the union were intermittent, and despite the initial morale of the Red Lion members, they were surprisingly slowly losing ground to the union over time. &quot;Boss, there are just too many! Their members are hiding everywhere, and their numbers grow each day with every factory and store they liberate.&quot; An officer reported to Leo in a small unrevealed command hideout, the view overlooking the main street where smoke and fumes continued to drift in the cold wind from burning husks of arctech wagons.</p><p>&quot;How many?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Estimates from our observers put them at a thousand and growing. As far as we can tell, they are putting a rifle in the hands of anyone who is coming to them. Many of their newer recruits are from other Sectors or Versian migrants.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fucking Versian trash...&quot; Leo cursed under his breath. It was not too much of a surprise to him that the Versians would be more open to the radical nature of the union, seeing as they had their own revolution 15 years prior. &quot;Have the enforcers mobilized yet?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bishop Vernette is on the move. Within three hours we will completely encircle this district and bring the union to heel.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ensure every tunnel in and out of this district that is on our record is guarded and monitored. I don't want a single food ration getting in and out.&quot; Leo reminded.</p><p>&quot;Understood, Boss, we'll starve them out.&quot;</p><p>Leo nodded, his gaze returning to the view of the burning district once more. While he still held a confident posture, deep down, he wondered just how it had come to backfire so spectacularly on him. <em>Gunther... I will personally make sure you live a long and harrowing life.</em></p><p>[Children of Raktor! I ask that you see past the manufactured differences between us, created by those above who seek to divide and conquer us!] Gunther's voice rang clear on the arctech radio placed in the command center. [There is no upper-class, no middle-class, no lower-class: there is only those who own, and those who labor! Work with us, for we are starting a revolution anew. One that has succeeded before, and will succeed again!]</p><p>&quot;Have we pinpointed where the transmission is coming from?&quot; Leo queried a Red Lion member who was jotting down recordings in a notebook.</p><p>&quot;We're almost done triangulating the signal strength for many of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Current guesses?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are not within our district, that's for sure. Nearly all of the sources originate from the enforcers' district.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We'll take care of that.&quot; Bishop Vernette's voice rang out as she entered the command center confidently, flanked by five enforcers.</p><p>&quot;So Count Leon finally listened.&quot; Leo barely acknowledged her arrival. &quot;I was beginning to wonder if you were behind this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This uprising affects me as much as you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about your Seven Snakes pet, hmm? They seem to be benefitting the most from this chaos.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We no longer work with them, I think that much was made clear months ago. Have you not heard our official announcements.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Non-action is equivalent to helping.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I made my stance clear to Count Leon. If you have issues, you can take it up with him.&quot; Bishop Vernette waved her hand dismissively, instead focusing on the situation at hand. &quot;I'm surprised you haven't massacred them yet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are spread through the streets like rats and birds - their command hierarchy is in complete shambles, and none of them truly know the exact extent nor strength of the union.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So the Mane of the Red Lion is brought low by a simple worker uprising. How poetic. The very thing that saw you to power now bites at your own ankles.&quot;</p><p>Leo scowled but did not raise a hand against her. &quot;I liked you better when you were still a naive priest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I liked you better when you were still a humble foreman.&quot; Bishop Vernette smirked. &quot;Your hand should have killed you by now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not when there is no shortage of enemies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even one that you have created yourself?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enough small talk. I will need your enforcers to bolster the lockdown and starve out the workers entrenched in their hiding holes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. But remember this, I'm only doing this as part of Count Leon's request. Who's to say on what could happen after this is done?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We'll see about that, old hag.&quot;</p><p>Soon, the reluctant combined force enforcers and the Red Lion members were working hand-in-hand, albeit with clear issues in the distribution of information. The mistrust between Leo and Bishop Vernette made trying to encircle the radical union difficult and time-consuming, and Leo was unwilling to reveal the full capabilities of the Red Lions. Similarly, Bishop Vernette too did not show her hand, only allocating a minimum number of enforcers to deal with the threat.</p><p>With the internal bickering in the combined force, it was near impossible to filter and recognize every single member, many of whom had just joined, radicals in their own right having flocked to a believable cause. Red Lion members and enforcers bickered with each other on every single possible move, a tug-of-war on control of the overall suppression operation.</p><p>As the days trailed on, it became even more and more clear that the situation was starting to spiral out of hand due to the disunity. More and more pockets of union resistance were beginning to spring up, even within the enforcers' district itself. Protests and strikes became more and more frequent, all the while business owners were harassed and in some cases, executed publicly in a bid to frighten the city into submission. The same bloody fate that had befallen Stanley and his son was repeatedly displayed across the South Sector.</p><p>What worsened the situation more was that some of the Red Lions and enforcers began to lose hope in ever suppressing the union, a minority even sympathizing and leaking information about deployments and raids to the union, rendering any coercive moves impotent.</p><p>Any threat of force by the enforcers were summarily ignored due to the union's possession of military grade weapons, resulting in sporadic firefights breaking out all over, even right in front of the Magda. There was no sense of rhythm nor rhyme to the expansion of the radical union, as though Gunther had simply given the tools to the people, spreading the fight as far as he could. Rumors of affiliated branches began to appear in other Sectors as well, threatening the overall stability of the city.</p><p>By the end of the next two weeks, even Leo was starting to get desperate, to the point where he himself was taking to the field. His overwhelming power allowed him to steamroll any opposition that he faced, but it was insignificant in the face of the exponentially growing numbers of the radical union. As he examined what remained of another union hiding spot hidden in the slums, he began to despair at the sheer scale of what he faced. &quot;Just how many hideouts do these rats have? It's like trying to crush a thousand ants hiding in the forest.&quot;</p><p>Yet it was not the numbers that truly frightened him, but the logistics of supplying that many union members as he noticed the copious amounts of ration packs made available in the shabby hideout, where five captured union members were tied up and forced to kneel. <em>Just how is Gunther keeping all of them in control? How is it possible to feed that many mouths?</em> At this stage, the union was now boasting a force even greater than the Ardent Cretins, and far more dispersed than anything the Red Lions could deal with. Every time they flushed a union hideout, three more popped up in their stead.</p><p>Leo stormed up to a captured union member, who had been clearly the overall in-charge for the hideout. In one swift motion, Leo had his red gaseous tendrils hang the man upside down, shaking him violently before hoisting the man's face to his eye level. &quot;Tell me where are the other hideouts, and maybe I'll let you live.&quot;</p><p>Even as the blood rushed to the captured union member's head, his forehead brimming red, the member spat a glob mixed with saliva and blood onto Leo's face, grinning widely. &quot;Better to die free than to die a slave.&quot;</p><p>Leo slowly wiped the spit off his face with a handkerchief. &quot;Last chance. We can be friends, or I can be the last face you ever see.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When I die, the only face I'll see is that of the Goddess Nona. Can you say the same, heathen?&quot; The captured union member continued grinning widely, mocking Leo until his face began to scrounge up in pain, his brows furrowing as he struggled against the red gaseous tendrils that held each of his limbs.</p><p>&quot;So be it.&quot; Leo stared into the man's eyes as the man's limbs were slowly tugged apart by the tendrils bit by bit. The sinews between his joints were pulled apart, the force immeasurable as the man bit down on his own tongue, drawing blood before finally letting out a pained shriek as the left arm gave way first, exposing the dislocated shoulder as well as streaks of flesh gushing out.</p><p>Within a minute, the man was quartered, his four limbs wrenched out of place, separated from his body and thrown to the remaining four union members, instilling fear behind them as the man still continued screaming, attempting to crawl away albeit without arms nor legs.</p><p>&quot;Ready to talk? First one lives.&quot; Leo grunted, the four captured union members instantly clamouring to speak over the other, hoping to avoid the gruesome fate that their leader faced.</p><p>The Red Lion members took over, interrogating and drawing information from their testimonies and confessions, yet soon, a bleak picture was painted for Leo. Despite the clear willingness of the union members to share information, that information was ultimately highly segregated and filtered. Each union cell was unique from another, with only the very top leaders around Gunther knowing the true extent of where each union cell was.</p><p>&quot;We.. we operate independently! We simply were told to recruit and fight for the cause wherever possible, to find the weakest spot!&quot; Another captured member exclaimed, further proving Leo's suspicion that the entire movement was a decentralized body. With no head to cut off, Leo did not see an easy way to end the instability.</p><p>&quot;Boss, perhaps... perhaps we should reach a compromise with the union.&quot; A Red Lion officer suggested, only to earn a glare from the frustrated Leo.</p><p>&quot;A compromise?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The level of destruction will only increase over time, and our finances are being severely affected as it is. Even our protection rackets are starting to falter.&quot; While the Red Lions could still enforce a certain level of security among their businesses, the simple fact was that residents were no longer sticking around to patronize them, causing their revenue to dip on a large scale.</p><p>&quot;There are far bigger fish to worry about than some paltry revenue of rakels. This is a war of annihilation. If we do not crush the union in time, I'm afraid the Red Lions may very well cease to exist.&quot;</p><p>@@@</p><p><em>The next day...</em></p><p>[Fears of union uprisings are beginning to spread throughout the city of Raktor. In what was originally a single factory unionizing has now turned into a sector-wide scare. Countless strikes and protests are brewing in every single district, with more and more workers joining the radical extremist union.] A radio presenter's voice drifted through the quiet mansion, Count Leon resting his head on his hands upon an opulent dark oak table complete with every fanciful decoration a noble could have, staring at a letter in front of him, the seal of a Duke on its edge.</p><p>His silence only unnerved the four generals standing in front of him, as well as every Baron and Bishop in Raktor save for Baron Cain, who was conspicuously missing. However, Count Leon was more concerned with pressing matters than a missing Baron. He raised his head, his sigh echoing about the large personal study. &quot;Barons and Bishops, thank you all for coming on short notice. I'll get straight to it: Would any of you care to explain how the radical union has yet to be crushed?&quot;</p><p>The South Sector's Red Lions district was now a veritable hotspot for the radical union. Even the help of the enforcers was employed within the last week, though the situation has only seemed to worsen.</p><p>No one dared to make the first step, almost all of them turning to look at Bishop Flectus, the Central Sector's Bishop who had been put in charge of the union suppression efforts. He cleared his throat, stepping forward with formality. &quot;Count Leon, sir. With all due respect, the union is hard to deal with due to the alluring nature of its cause - &quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not want fanciful words or excuses, Bishop. My business, the city's businesses are suffering, and in turn, my taxes and subsequently my power, which is the very hand that is keeping ALL of you alive and wealthy. Right now, the business owners are putting forward a petition to have me renounce my position! Every operation you have done has only led to more disasters. Why can't you just kill every single union leader and be done with it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Killing the leaders will only paint them as martyrs, for others to rally around. Already, the death of Bronco, the union's leader second-in-command, has increased fervor for the cause.&quot; Bishop Flectus did not waver, adamant. &quot;Our sincere belief is that the correct approach is-&quot;</p><p>&quot;To outlaw every form of worker organization in the city. Right now, we simply do not have the legal right to arrest them. It does not exist in the Sanctum's code, which means we would need to apply for a special inquisition order. If we try to subvert the code, it would be another talking point for those undecided in these events.&quot; Baron Namor, the Baron of the East Sector offered his approach, interrupting Bishop Flectus. &quot;Until we have the legal and moral right to suppress the union, our arms are tied.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Outlaw every form?&quot; Bishop Vernette scoffed. &quot;You might as well outlaw the Sanctum as well - we, too, provide protection for workers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Clearly I was misunderstood. These laws and amendments to the code shall obviously need to be reworded and discussed properly through the appropriate avenues-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I HAVE NO TIME FOR LEGAL BULLSHIT!&quot; Count Leon slammed the table. &quot;I have a joint military exercise with Kregol and Perlis along with an imminent war within months, and I will be the laughing stock of all of the Yual Dominion if I cannot get my own city in order. Who is funding the union and keeping them afloat?! How are they feeding a thousand fighters across the damned city?&quot;</p><p>No one could answer that question - all they had now was suspicion and theories. The silence only angered Count Leon even more. &quot;I want the union dead. Crushed. Torn to pieces, so they will never rise again!&quot;</p><p>&quot;This will only cause even more unrest and uprising, which would serve as a potent knife for those who seek to undermine our stability. It's clear that someone not among us is funding them. Are you sure about taking a violent approach?&quot; Bishop Vernette raised her eyebrows, only angering Count Leon even more.</p><p>&quot;I'm starting to think you're in leagues with the union yourself, Bishop Vernette. Perhaps you are the one funding them.&quot; Count Leon accused.</p><p>&quot;My own men and inquisitors are fighting tooth and nail on every reported strike and protest as we speak. Perhaps before resorting to unnecessary doubt and grasping at straws, we should focus on concrete solutions. Not finding scapegoats.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We can mobilize the military, call martial law.&quot; A general gave his suggestion. &quot;Make gatherings illegal temporarily, override the Sanctum's code, give the military extralegal authority.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you implying that the enforcers of the Sanctum are weak?&quot; Bishop Flectus retorted.</p><p>&quot;Could not have put it better myself. The very fact that your enforcers fail to squash such an simple uprising shows that the military is far better suited for such a suppression campaign.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To question the effectiveness of the Sanctum of Yual is to question the decision of Emperor Yual himself! Martial law is only to be called in the most severe of emergencies, and it has never been called in the history of Raktor. Doing so would make ALL of us look weak. Think of our reputation!&quot;</p><p>While the generals, barons, and bishops bickered about the next steps, Count Leon let out an exasperated sigh, clearly distressed and suddenly bursting out in anger a minute later. &quot;ENOUGH! You have two more weeks - two more weeks to find the union leaders and have all of them crushed! Lure them, cheat them, I do not care what it takes. Or else our positions, not just mine, will be in jeopardy.&quot;</p><p>Count Leon simmered with rage as he stared at them, before realizing something. &quot;Where is Baron Cain? Why is he not attending the meeting?! It has been more than twenty minutes! You two, find him and bring him before me right this ins-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No need for that, Count Leon. I am right here.&quot; The doors to the personal study swung open, revealing Baron Cain along with an unexpected guest. Count Leon shot up from his seat while Bishop Vernette only squinted her eyes in suspicion, the rest taken aback by the guest’s appearance.</p><p>&quot;What are you doing bringing a gang leader here?!&quot; Count Leon roared.</p><p>&quot;To deliver your requested weapons and armor, of course,&quot; Kyle spoke with respect, his voice calm unlike that of Count Leon.</p><p>&quot;But-&quot;</p><p>&quot;But how is it possible after everything that has happened? Is that what you wanted to say?&quot; Kyle smirked, Count Leon bristling with fury unlike never before.</p><p>&quot;How dare you enter uninvited. Guards!&quot; Baron Namor immediately ordered two enforcers to step forward to arrest Kyle.</p><p>Yet, before the enforcers could get close to Kyle, Count Leon took a deep breath, calming himself. &quot;The rest of you, please allow me to have a private conversation with Baron Cain and this gentleman over here.&quot;</p><p>The generals looked at each other shiftily, confused about what was happening before finally reluctantly leaving with the others. Baron Namor shot a glare of disgust at Baron Cain, while Bishop Vernette brushed past Kyle for a brief moment. &quot;Please don't pull me into whatever you have planned this time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. I value my allies' prosperity, whether or not they leave me out to dry.&quot; Kyle smiled.</p><p>Soon, only Count Leon, Baron Cain and Kyle were left alone within the personal study. Kyle took a seat without asking, leaning into a comfortable armchair and crossing his legs without a care in the world.</p><p>&quot;You two, you fuckers. You planned all of this!&quot; Count Leon accused. &quot;Give me one good reason why I should not have you exiled on counts of treason!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Treason?&quot; Baron Cain shrugged. &quot;We simply fulfilled the contract as requested. Of course, the factory underwent certain unexplained hardships, but thanks to Mr. Kyle over here, we were able to sort it out effectively enough to meet the order. And under the terms of the contract, we are expecting remuneration, of course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will have to ensure that the delivery is in order.&quot; Count Leon rang up his servants, irritated by the smug look on Baron Cain's face. &quot;Check that the weapons and armor are delivered exactly to the number stated in the contract.&quot;</p><p>[Count Leon, sir, it's confirmed. All rifles and knight armor sets are accounted for, both standard and reduced versions.]</p><p>&quot;Impossible...&quot; Count Leon was too shaken to even be angry any longer.</p><p>&quot;Count Leon. We're both businessmen who clearly value time, so let me get to the point.&quot; Kyle took over the conversation, leaning forward with a glint in his eye, ready to strike for the kill. &quot;You hired a gang, the Red Lions to disrupt my businesses and my district. On top of that, you made a seemingly ridiculous order that no other factory in Raktor could meet, something that would require a miracle. I do not begrudge you for that - it is a free market after all, the rules of the game are fluid. Unfortunately for you, I specialize in miracles.&quot;</p><p>Count Leon did not reply, watching Kyle get up and pace around the room, continuing to speak. &quot;Whether you intended it or not, the Red Lions engineered a union uprising within my territory, and now that the radical union has escaped the confines of my grasp, it is now wreaking havoc across the city, stirring up emotions and long-suppressed dreams of revolution, of better things. The Red Lions cannot even control the union in their own borders.&quot;</p><p>Count Leon gritted his teeth in anger, finally realizing what happened. &quot;You purposefully let the radical union out so it would bring me to the negotiating table. You are the ones funding the radical union now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps. Perhaps not. Who's to say? But maybe...&quot; Kyle smirked, approaching the table right in front of Count Leon.</p><p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; Count Leon snarled.</p><p>&quot;I want a mutual understanding, that we can both work better together than against each other. My weapons and armor are qualitatively better than your current suppliers, and I am more than willing to share the design. For a price, a percentage, of course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not enough. I could easily have my men come up with a better design. Why do I need you? Baron Namor and his engineers could do it in a heartbeat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then why haven't they? Clearly you're lacking a few critical ingredients, a few leaps in theoretical understanding. Also, I'm not finished yet. On top of the design offering, as a sign of goodwill, I will help you crush the union in one fell swoop for free.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A sign of goodwill? Crush the union? HAH!&quot; Count Leon let out a mirthless laugh. &quot;You want to do what not even the generals, barons, and bishops can do? What can you do that the enforcers or the major gangs cannot do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unlike the Tul'e Da'li who seems to think beating up every single union worker is the best solution, I propose a surgical strike, where I will kill or capture all of the union leaders.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What makes you so confident? The bishops have already tried that - even the Mad Dog cannot get to the leader herself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because I have something different. I have something dear to the union leader, and that is my trump card. But until we have an agreement, you may enjoy dealing with the union as large. My prediction? If you do not deal with the leadership immediately, you will face a general city-wide strike within three months, right when you least expect it.&quot;</p><p><em>Something dear to the union leader?</em> Count Leon raised his eyebrows in curiosity. &quot;And if you fail?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then consider the deal off. You may do whatever you want to me - but don't expect me not to fight back.&quot; Kyle concluded, sitting back in the same armchair.</p><p>Count Leon kept silent for a moment, considering his options. <em>I could have him killed right here and now. But his weapons and armor are truly better than their counterparts, and if he really does have the means to stop the union...</em> &quot;You planned all of this from the start.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only in response to your plan. It is all a game in the end, but with all of us winning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll very much prefer if you two lose.&quot; Count Leon threatened.</p><p>&quot;Do you know why the Bishop of the South Sector and Baron Cain are working alongside me now, despite my... background? It's because they have come to the conclusion that to be my ally is far more desirable than to be my enemy. You'll find that dealing with me even when I'm dead will be more trouble than the union is.&quot; Kyle tapped the holster of his armchair, not budging under the glare of Count Leon.</p><p>Count Leon was not dumb. He knew of the reason why Kyle was let off so easily - the release of the handguns was still a major threat. Now that the radical union was also in full-swing, antagonizing Kyle right now would be the worst move to make, only stacking the problems even higher. <em>I will use him, for now.</em> &quot;Fine. You shall receive a royalty amounting to one-tenth worth of the price for every subsequent design produced by the Aspis Weapons Factory for the purpose of Raktor's military, the design also having been accredited by the military. And you will -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three-tenths.&quot;</p><p>Count Leon's words were stuck in his throat, before he recomposed himself, glaring at Kyle. &quot;Two tenths.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three-tenths.&quot; Kyle did not budge.</p><p>&quot;Two and a quarter tenths.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three-tenths, Count Leon. I'm not the one who needs to worry about a union growing stronger by the minute. The clock is ticking.&quot;</p><p>Count Leon clenched the table, his hand nearly cracking the hardwood edge off. &quot;FINE! Three-tenths. But only for up to a year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Accepted. We can renegotiate at a later date. Pleasure to be working with you, Count Leon.&quot; Kyle shot up from his seat, adjusting his suit and coat with a wide smile on his face. &quot;Do try not to undermine my operations where possible, it would only cause certain designs to be severely hampered. My designers require the best of environments to produce quality work.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get lost. I want the union leadership captured in a week!&quot; Count Leon roared.</p><p>&quot;Of course, my Count.&quot; Kyle only gave a courteous nod, before leaving the personal study. As soon as he opened the door, he was met with the glares of the generals, barons, and bishops.</p><p>&quot;I'm surprised you made it out of there alive, I was certain you would have been dead. No gang leader has ever entered his personal study room before.&quot; Baron Namor remarked.</p><p>&quot;I suppose there is a first for everything. Though it's hard for someone who is always coming in second in most rankings to truly appreciate that.&quot; Kyle didn't linger around to see Baron Namor's face scrounging up in pure unbridled rage, though Kyle motioned for Bishop Vernette to follow him outside.</p><p>&quot;What have you done now? Are you planning to antagonize the whole city? That man is a Baron, and he has extremely close ties with the Tul'E Da'li!&quot;</p><p>&quot;His influence is only in the East Sector. Despite the differences between me and Sebastian, I'm sure the Ardent Cretins would not tolerate another major gang enforcing their dislikes in our sector. However, I do need to ask you a favor. You no longer need to distance yourself from me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;... what do you want?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I need a prisoner transfer. A very highly publicized one. From the shopping arcade to the Magda. I will provide a full list of everything I need, and it must be organized within two days. Do this, and I will forget your past actions against me.&quot;</p><p><em>Why are you the one forgiving me?!</em> &quot;Fine. Inquisitor Mason shall be the liaison. Are you sure you know what you are doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;When have I never been sure?&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 92 - Attempted Rescue</strong></p><p><em>A day later...</em></p><p>&quot;Gunther. It's bad.&quot; A member reported in a hectic meeting room in the same hideout they started in, now filled to the brim with new recruits that came from all over the city, the most radical of them all fighting tooth and nail against the enforcers and Red Lion gang members. &quot;Long Hua is going to be transferred to the Magda in less than a day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's clearly a trap.&quot; Bronco immediately replied. &quot;Obviously, it is meant to pull us out of hiding.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So the Seven Snakes have finally turned against us.&quot; Gunther murmured to himself, sighing. He had waged war and sparked a violent revolution, spreading the cause as wide and as far as he could. The teachings have already taken root in the city, touching the hearts of many and emboldening those who thought that a union uprising was not feasible.</p><p>&quot;We should go even deeper underground. The success of the revolution depends on us. We cannot sacrifice the future for one man.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Long Hua is our brother.&quot; Gunther retorted.</p><p>&quot;Then he will know that we've made the right decision!&quot;</p><p>&quot;How large is the prisoner escort?&quot; Gunther asked the member, ignoring Bronco.</p><p>&quot;The escort will be compromised of a hundred Seven Snakes members and the South Sector's enforcers combined. It would be the most heavily guarded target that we have hit so far. The wagon they are traveling will be heavily reinforced.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We don't have the weapons necessary to attack them. We would need mortars, grenades, explosives.&quot; Bronco frowned, his fingers running through a catalog of all equipment stored in the hideout. &quot;Perhaps if we raided a military storage...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Out of the question.&quot; Gunther rejected the idea instantly, instead turning to an armored arctech knight who stood nearby, overlooking the meeting room. &quot;Can your master supply us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No?!&quot; Bronco fumed. &quot;What do you mean, no? Wasn't your master supposed to be our patron?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My master's goodwill is not infinite. He would require compensation in some form or another.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The designs for the Aspis MK1 Armor. As well as the improved rifle.&quot; Gunther did not hesitate at all.</p><p>&quot;Then you shall have what you need by the end of the day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. Let us plan for the route. Any information on that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it's a tight secret. But the final destination is certainly the Magda.&quot;</p><p>Gunther nodded, quickly mocking up all possible routes from the shopping arcade to the Magda. &quot;Here is the plan. We will destroy the roads on these few streets as soon as the convoy comes into range, forcing them to stop. This is when we will launch an attack, but not a concentrated one. Each cell will act independently, attempting to kill or maim as many of the escorts as possible. Once the actual wagon holding Long Hua has been confirmed, then our strike team will move in to rescue him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What if we cannot destroy the roads in time?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have the members launch an impromptu protest tomorrow, blanket out the main streets where the convoy is most likely to travel. We will swamp the enforcers with bodies and bog them down, making our rescue mission easier. Any questions?&quot;</p><p>Most of the leaders were in agreement with the plan, but some still held doubts. &quot;This is but one man. Sacrificing this many resources to save him is ridiculous!&quot; One of the leaders complained. &quot;Our resources should be focused on growing and expanding our reach.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you implying that we should leave one of our own behind, to suffer and be tortured?&quot; Gunther retorted. &quot;The union stands for all workers - their worth is immeasurable! I would not hesitate to rescue you myself if you were the one imprisoned. Not one soul is ranked above another, for all men are equal!&quot;</p><p>Those who were still on the fence had no argument left, keeping quiet as Gunther continued issuing orders, distributing commands to the various cells embedded all over the South Sector. &quot;This will be dangerous, as we only have a few hours to prepare. But we shall prove the might and solidarity of our cause through this, and our legend will spread even further beyond!&quot; Gunther rallied them, eliciting a cheer from his followers.</p><p>As they dispersed to prepare for the rescue, Bronco hurriedly pulled Gunther over to the side, whispering urgently into his ear. &quot;Look, we know each other well enough. Is it really worth all of this to save him? This is definitely a trap - many of us might die in this rescue operation.&quot;</p><p>Gunther grabbed Bronco's shoulder, staring at him eye to eye. &quot;That is why I need you in the strike team. I have a special mission for you. No one else must know about this.&quot;</p><p>@@@</p><p><em>A day later....</em></p><p>&quot;Eat up, maggot. Don't forget to wash your hands.&quot; The guard chortled as he tossed a moldy piece of radish into the jail cell. The white, chewy flesh was immediately pounced upon by a severely malnourished Guang Hwa, who knelt on the floor and used his mouth to bite into it, gobbling it down as fast as he could, uncaring about the algae-covered stone tiles that grazed against his nose and cheeks.</p><p>As soon as he was done, he used the back of his palms to hoist himself back up, lying face up on the cold slimy prison floor, staring at the dark ceiling crawling with insects. Some slithered down on their silk strings, drawn to the exposed flesh beneath his missing fingernails while he panted, swallowing the remaining bits of radish still in his mouth. He was far from the only one in the cell, being accompanied by five others who were all clearly far too incapacitated to even move or talk, leaving himself alone to his thoughts.</p><p>Soon, a familiar pair of footsteps began to approach the cell, their shadows extending into the hallway from the dim lights. Guang Hwa instinctively shuddered, scrambling away from the grills with haste. Yet it was to no avail, the cell's door opening to reveal Niko grinning. &quot;Time for a new house, friend! Looks like you are not doing too well in here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;F...fuck you! I'm not telling you anything!&quot; Guang Hwa muttered through short pained breaths as Niko grabbed the nape of his neck, dragging him out of the shared cell. His futile resistance only earned him a kick from Niko into his chin, his jaw knocked ajar from the force.</p><p>&quot;And here I thought we had something special going.&quot; Niko chuckled. &quot;Looks I'll really miss our time together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...wha...what? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're getting a new house! Amazing, isn't it? Not many can afford a roof over their heads, especially in this kind of property market. Prices have been going up, don’t you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What the fuck are you talking abo-&quot; Another kick into his ribs shut Guang Hwa up for good, spit and saliva choking out of his mouth.</p><p>&quot;Come on, boys, the princess needs a lift!&quot;</p><p>Two Seven Snakes guards entered, cuffing his limbs and hoisting him up out of the cell, his mind dizzy from the gut-wrenching pain and forceful treatment. Bright white lights went past him in a hazy blur as he was hauled out of the prison, and unceremoniously tossed into what felt like the back of a wagon, the two guards boarding with him.</p><p>Guang Hwa could feel the rough bulbous surface of the cheap cast iron used to make the floor, struggling about to stand up. His hands clamored for a grip, only to accidentally cling onto the armored Seven Snakes guard's ankles, earning yet another violent kick that sent him sprawling.</p><p>&quot;CEO of the Golden Snakes... had the world and he gave it up.&quot; Another guard muttered as he placed the sole of his metal-tipped boots on the handcuffs of Guang Hwa, pinning him down.</p><p>&quot;Teaches you not to mess with the Seven Snakes. Traitors get carved up just like him.&quot; The first guard shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>&quot;At least he wasn't sent to the training caves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it would be too easy of a death for him.&quot;</p><p>Rage welled up within Guang Hwa as he mustered the strength to speak back. &quot;Fucking brainless sheep, you're worse than goblins at your best and lower than a maggot at your worst. Mindlessly following those above you like cattle led to the slaughter!&quot;</p><p>The two guards stared at each other, before breaking out into a subtle laugh. Guang Hwa sneered. &quot;What's so funny? Funny that I'm right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, just thinking how you match the briefing perfectly. Niko did say you were gonna try to rile us up or hit us with a speech.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well that only proves my point that you lot are spineless cowards with not a single pinch of self-respect shared between the two of you - no, between all of the Seven Snakes. Kyle is leading all of you astray! He's part of the owning class, and we, you and I, are the working class!&quot;</p><p>An awkward silence reigned in the back of the wagon, which was surprisingly stationary. Guang Hwa twisted his back, trying to get a good look at the two guards' faces. &quot;Well?!&quot; He grunted.</p><p>&quot;Uhh, were you talking to us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Grrr!&quot; Guang Hwa struggled against the weight of the boot pinning his cuffs down.</p><p>&quot;Damian said that would rile you up as well.&quot;</p><p>In sheer frustration, Guang Hwa began to tug as hard as he could on the cuffs, the top of his skin shredding against the sharp metallic edges and drawing blood. Before he could even move another inch, the two guards immediately grabbed him and hoisted him up onto the bench built into the wall.</p><p>&quot;What? Can't let me die?&quot; Guang Hwa mocked as he tried again, only to be restrained by the guards.</p><p>&quot;I wish I could, but your new owner wanted you in tiptop condition.&quot;</p><p>&quot;New owner...? You're selling me?!&quot;</p><p>Guang Hwa's surprised expression earned another chuckle from the two guards, this time with one of them reluctantly handing over three rakels to the other.</p><p>&quot;Told you he would be surprised! Niko said so too!&quot; The other guard chortled.</p><p>&quot;Damn it...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enough! I demand to be informed where exactly are we going!&quot; Guang Hwa roared.</p><p>Before the two guards could reply, the door to the wagon's cabin opened, with Damian entering the driver's seat. &quot;We're going to the Magda, where you will be handed over to the proper authorities.&quot;</p><p>Guang Hwa immediately stiffened up. While his treatment was horrendous under Kyle's imprisonment, it was a well know fact of the sheer hostility that Versians faced in the local prisons. It was near guaranteed that he would be treated far worse under the enforcers. &quot;Look, I'll talk, okay? I'll tell you all the hideouts, the attack patterns, the stashes!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You already told us most of that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-well, not all of it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Save the rest for the Bishop.&quot;</p><p>Guang Hwa tried to convince Damian further, only to have a cloth forced into his mouth, gagging him temporarily.</p><p>[First dummy wagon convoy was hit on Hullbreaker Lane. Suspicious activity gathering around Deogul Square. Suggest to avoid.] An observer's voice crackled through the radio built into the driver's cabin, a dim green light flickering on and off near the top.</p><p>Damian reached up to toggle the microphone. &quot;Understood, taking route 53. Are the enforcers ready?&quot;</p><p>[Ready when you are.]</p><p>&quot;Good, let's move. Keep your eyes peeled.&quot;</p><p>The wagon convoy lurched forward, picking up speed as twelve wagons formed a line snaking through the various streets and junctions. Enforcer wagons led the convoy from the front, their presence kicking up a huge buzz among the countless residents who ogled the huge armed presence.</p><p>Guang Hwa could only stare in silence through the small grill windows of the modified wagon, watching the familiar sights and sounds of the Seven Snakes district roll past slowly. There was no escape for him this time round, not when Damian was in the very same wagon as him.</p><p>The two guards clutched the holster of their rifles tightly, their eyes continuously darting around as they scanned the outside surroundings. Their gazes met a few pedestrians, all of whom stared back in shock and confusion, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>&quot;Something's wrong.&quot; One of the guards mentioned. &quot;Way too many people on the street at this time of day. It's like nobody is working now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe they are all on strike?&quot; The other joked, before the wagon started to slow down noticeably, Damian cursing under his breath.</p><p>Guang Hwa peeked through the small little gap that afforded a view of the front, seeing another identical wagon in front, clearly part of the convoy. Damian remained calm, checking for any anomalies while toggling the radio again. &quot;What's the hold up?&quot;</p><p>[Some old man tripped when he was trying to cross the road.]</p><p>&quot;Get out and help him move out of the way. Every stop is an opportunity for the enemy. Observers, any movements?&quot;</p><p>[Seems to be a few separate mobs, but they aren't congregating just yet. We spotted a few picket lines further down, though they aren't budging.]</p><p>&quot;Alternatives?&quot;</p><p>[Take a left on the next corner, then a right. Should be clear.]</p><p>&quot;Understood.&quot; Damian placed his hands on the wheel steadily, while two enforcers from the frontmost wagon went to help the old man. Instead of being grateful, the old man began to curse and swear, shrugging off their help.</p><p>Instead of being grateful, the old man began to curse and swear, shrugging off their help. &quot;What are you two cunts doing, going this fast down the street? I can't cross the road that quickly!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, please, let us help you up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think I'm a chick? I'm a grown man, I can help myself.&quot; Yet it was painfully obvious that the old man was far from being able to support himself up, his legs wobbling violently as he almost collapsed to the floor again. While the two enforcers began to force the old man off the road, bystanders and onlookers simply walked past, far more intrigued by the wagon than the old man himself. They peered into the wagon, with a young grimy kid catching a glimpse of Guang Hwa himself, locking eyes with him.</p><p>As soon as that occurred, the radio began to stir to life, the reports intensifying. [Damian, sir, lots of movement! Everyone in the vicinity is swarming towards you! You need to move, now!]</p><p>&quot;Fuck!&quot; Damian swore, flicking another switch on the radio dashboard. &quot;Incoming enemy attack, all wagons move off immediately!&quot;</p><p>[But sir, the front wagon is still held up-]</p><p>&quot;Ignore them, drive around!&quot;</p><p>The second wagon complied, leading the charge and mounting the curb with impunity, the shouts and screams of the running residents blurring past the convoy as they followed along, bypassing the old man and the two enforcers. Damian gritted his teeth as he jolted the wheel hard left, the wagon nearly tipping over as they entered another street. As soon as the convoy hit the next junction to make a right, instead of accelerating like expected, Damian was forced to hit the brakes hard, jostling the two guards and Guang Hwa behind violently. &quot;Now what?!&quot;</p><p>[There's a strike going on here - I don't know, hundreds of them just showed up!] The observer's panicked voice was starting to be drowned out by what seemed to be an impromptu protest march, taking up the entire street that they had been planning to enter.</p><p>&quot;It's the damn union. I need an alternate route, now!&quot;</p><p>[Go straight, then make a left-]</p><p>The convoy didn't wait around for the observer to finish explaining, moving to another street down a block, only to be met with the same situation. &quot;They have us cornered. Get down and force a way clear for the convoy!&quot; Damian roared, prompting Seven Snakes guards and enforcers to unload from the various other wagons, their rifles brought to bear on the marching protestors.</p><p>While the guards held the crowd at bay, the convoy moved ever so slowly, allowing the mobs from the other streets to begin flanking the convoy, smothering them in a sea of angry protestors and onlookers who had clearly no idea why they were there in the first place. &quot;Get out of the way! Obstruction of enforcer duty will be punishable by law!&quot; An enforcer shoved a protestor back, only to earn sticks and stones being tossed towards him.</p><p>&quot;By law?! You want to talk about law when you barely even enforced any of it against the thugs and gangs that have been harassing us?!&quot; Another protestor hollered back, riling up the crowd even more.</p><p>&quot;This is your last chance - return to your homes immediately!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck you!&quot;</p><p>As the fighting and arguing became more intense, Damian began to watch the surrounding shophouses carefully, looking for any suspicious vantage points from where the union might be watching from. The convoy was precariously exposed, the people around clamoring to get closer while the guards and enforcers tried to hold them back. &quot;This is taking way too long, we're sitting ducks here!&quot;</p><p>Some of the more daring protestors threw their bodies right in front of the convoy, forcing the wagons to come to a complete halt while a wave of protestors crashed, fueled by a mindless mob craze seemingly driven by instinct. Guang Hwa watched as hands clamored onto the wagon's small grill windows, only to earn a sharp jab from the barrel of rifles wielded by the two guards. &quot;BACK OFF!&quot; A guard roared, threatening again with the rifle brought to bear this time.</p><p>Damian's eyes darted about, looking for an alternative escape route before he caught the glint of a bright metal flash from afar between the shutters of a shophouse window, instinctively ducking as a pellet shattered the side-mirror into a thousand dazzling glass shards. The pellet ricocheted into the crowd, maiming a lady and earning a harrowing scream while the protestors all cowered.</p><p>&quot;They shot someone! They shot us!&quot; One amidst the crowd fan the flames of rage, some of the more violent protestors taking it upon themselves to charge and try to flip the wagon. More pellets rang out through the chaos, the wagon suffering withering fire as Damian kept his head down, unable to clearly see where they were being shot from.</p><p>&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Damian roared as he floored the accelerator while sharply twisting the wheel, the wagon brutishly charging forward without a care for collateral damage. Cries of pain and calls to violence hardly mattered in the face of an arctech wagon, but there were still far too many bodies blocking his way out. &quot;Shoot to kill!&quot;</p><p>The Seven Snakes guards compiled instantly, firing at anyone who was attacking the convoy physically without hesitation. Many of them were still fresh recruits, but their time in the training caves had successfully desensitized them to the carnage and suffering that they inflicted on the whimpering protestors.</p><p>Damian himself drew his own handgun, shooting down the protestors who attempted to block the wagon from moving with impunity. As the frightened unarmed protestors began to scramble, the union fighters behind the engineered swarm of people were slowly revealed, armed to the teeth with the same armor set and rifles as the guards and enforcers.</p><p>While the other convoy escort wagons were bogged down in the ensuing firefight that seemed to break out in all directions, Guang Hwa's wagon roared to life as Damian swerved through the panicking fleeing crowd, earning a few pellets to the side, the pellets bouncing off the thick armor harmlessly. &quot;It'll take more than a few rifles to stop this wagon.&quot; The first guard grinned as the pitter-patter of whizzing pellets continuously barraged the wagon.</p><p>Damian could finally see the end of the street, a clear path beyond that led to the Magda. Yet suddenly, he noticed a small squad of three standing right in the middle of the road, mounting what seemed to be like a long metallic cylinder on their shoulders, the tip aimed straight at him. His battle instincts kicked in, trying to weave out of the way.</p><p>His eyes could only watch as a projectile burst forth from the cylinder, accelerated by the engravings along the side and nearly toppling over its wielder. The projectile slammed into the wagon, crushing the passenger seat of the cabin, narrowly avoiding him. It looked eerily like a spearhead, albeit far larger than what one would brandish on a regular spear.</p><p>Thick lines of engravings swirled around its surface, glowing for a sharp instant before Damian suddenly felt the wagon jolt to an immediate halt as if it were grounded, the motion far too intense and flipping the wagon forward. The world spun around him as the top of the wagon slammed into the smooth cobblestones with a loud bang, the ceiling caving inwards erratically.</p><p>Damian grunted while he found himself upside down in the driver's cabin, slightly crushed in with his rifle badly bent from the impact. Without missing a beat, he forcibly kicked the door open, the hinges blasting off while the door itself slammed into a union fighter head-on, allowing Damian to quickly slid out. Before he could even recover into a fighting posture, however, pellets were already shot at him, the union trying to kill him as fast as they could.</p><p>The tattooed engravings beneath his skin burned into life, hardening his skin under the modified Aspis MK1 armor he wore, allowing him to bear the brunt of the withering fire even if the pellet found a chink in the plates. In three leaps, he sprinted at the closest union fighter, grabbing the fighter's rifle with his left and driving his right fist deep into the guts of the fighter's stomach.</p><p>Even the union fighter's stolen Aspis MK1 armor was far from enough to withstand the blunt trauma inflicted by Damian's punch, the ceramic-filled honeycomb shattering easily and transferring the full momentum into his bones as he was sent flying into the nearest storefront. The mannequins and display figurines collapsed into a disheveled heap under the weight of the Union fighter while Damian swung the butt of his freshly-stolen rifle at another Union fighter, the butt slamming right into the jaw and concussing him.</p><p>Under the torrent of pellet fire, Damian hugged the wreck of the wagon closely, putting what remained of the armored frame between him and the union fighters. As he ducked instinctively from the barrage, he slammed the walls twice. &quot;HEY! You two alive?&quot;</p><p>There was no response, Damian fearing the worst. Nearly two dozen union fighters were pinning him down now. Even if he managed to climb over to the cabin and yank out his stuck tower shield, it would be certain death to attempt to fight back.</p><p>Yet he held strong, firing back over his cover and taking out as many union fighters as he could. Already in the distance, he could see the rest of the convoy escorts rushing over, preventing him from being fully surrounded on all sides. The firefight raged like thunder and hailstorm as he clambered to the back of the wagon, prying open the wrecked doors to reveal two unconscious guards and a clearly frightened Guang Hwa, still gagged and bound.</p><p>Damian slung the stolen rifle behind his back and gave a tight smack to both of the unconscious guards' faces in a desperate attempt to wake the both of them up but to no avail. &quot;This location is too dangerous. Get up!&quot; He hauled the shivering Guang Hwa to his feet, before motioning for three other Seven Snakes guards to move up as additional support while he tore out the broken door to use as a temporary shield. &quot;Cover me to that lane!&quot;</p><p>Guang Hwa let out a muffled shriek as he was dragged through the ravaged battlefield, the smell of burning flesh and clouds of fine stone dust wafting through the air while pellets tore through them to find their marks, earning painful grunts and shouts of battle. He scampered alongside Damian's makeshift door-shield unsteadily, keeping their heads and body as low as they could while the supporting guards laid suppressive fire.</p><p>&quot;They are trying to escape with the prisoner! Get them!&quot; A union fighter leader called out, the brunt of the firefight starting to shift towards Damian's shield. The force of the pellets slamming against the door-shield resonated through his arms, nearly making it numb while he watched one of the supporting guards take a pellet right into the neck between the chinks of armor, the white of bone visible as it shredded the spine apart in a single tear.</p><p>&quot;RUN, YOU IDIOT!&quot; Damian roared at the still shivering Guang Hwa, slapping him on the back and sending him tumbling towards the alleyway, earning scratches and slices from the rubble that drew beads of blood. While the remaining two guards blocked the entrance to the backlane, Damian hoisted Guang Hwa up with his free arm, running as fast as he could.</p><p>Guang Hwa's world spun as they turned sharp corners one after the other, Damian familiar with every nook and cranny. They snuck through rows of piled trash underneath the dripping soap from hung laundry high above them, losing their pursuers as the sounds of fighting were beginning to be drowned out by the ambient whir of arctech house machinery, pipes churning with filtered air or water along the sides of the buildings' walls that flanked them on both ends.</p><p>&quot;Looks like we're in the clear for now.&quot; Damian muttered as he got his bearings, using the buildings and the streets as landmarks to orientate himself. Before he could make a move, he suddenly heard the tumble of a rock, a small circular ball of metal rolling right down to their feet.</p><p>Damian instantly held his door-shield up, but instead of expecting a storm of fragments bursting out, a soft, lighter-than-air gas tinged with a purple hue surged forward, enveloping both him and Guang Hwa by surprise. &quot;Fuck!&quot; He grabbed Guang Hwa by the nape of his neck and rushed off, only to find his limbs and muscles, his blood pressure starting to slow down significantly. Numbness crept into every pore of his skin, the tingling sensation causing him to loosen his grip on his surroundings.</p><p>He tried to speak, but his mouth didn't move the way he wanted it to, his words slurring around instead in a daze as he slumped to the floor, only able to watch as five union fighters appeared with gas masks fixed on their faces, the bright engravings on the covers filtering the gas with each hiss they breathed.</p><p>One of the union fighters aimed his rifle at the incapacitated Damian, only for another to shove the barrel out of the way. &quot;Idiot, you want to bring the entire Seven Snakes onto us?&quot; A familiar muffled voice spoke, Damian recognizing the owner. <em>Bronco.</em></p><p>&quot;We're already at war with the city, what's one more gang to us? We are the revolution!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then you should know very well to not create more enemies than necessary. If we kill the underboss of the Seven Snakes, the very same gang who accepted all of our demands and is running the moderate union, what would the public think of us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gunther said no compromises.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm the commander on the ground right here and now. Focus on saving Long Hua!&quot;</p><p>Three soldiers moved forward to undo the cuffs on Guang Hwa's hands and the gag in his mouth. Having inhaled the incapacitating gas as well, Guang Hwa's head lolled to the side as he was hoisted up. &quot;Ready to move, Bronco. Where to next? Hideout 5A? ... Bronco?&quot; A union fighter asked warily as Bronco seemed to be checking his rifle intently, making sure he had enough pellets.</p><p>Without warning, Bronco flicked his rifle upwards, killing the three union fighters with a single headshot each in one swift motion. Before the remaining fighter could react, he bashed his elbow into the back of the fighter's head, knocking him out onto the ground and ending his life with three pellets to the chest.</p><p>Guang Hwa's eyes widened, his brain screaming to move, yet his intoxicated body hardly responded, his limbs only shifting slightly as Bronco walked up to him. &quot;I know what you want to say, but I didn't want to hear it. Sorry for this, Brother.&quot;</p><p>A single pull of the trigger blasted Guang Hwa's brain out, the sickening grey flesh splattering with copious amounts of blood draining out of the fear-stricken face. Bronco instantly holstered his rifle on his back, taking out a knife and carving away at Guang Hwa's neck for a minute or two, stripping away the sinews and cutting right through the bones before yanking it off his body by the roots of the hair.</p><p>&quot;One down, one more to go.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 93 - Ensnaring</strong></p><p>The never-ending waves of reports and shouts over the arctech radios washed over Gunther, countless casualties and injuries streaming into the hideout, desperate fighters missing limbs still raring to launch a second wave against the escort while volunteer nurses and medical staff tried to hold them down.</p><p>&quot;Gunther, the prisoner escaped with the underboss. They are running on foot now.&quot; One of the radical council members informed him.</p><p>&quot;Have the fighters hunt them down. I want our informants keeping a lookout for the two of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, Gunther.&quot;</p><p>The battle raged on as the rescue operation lingered on. Soon, an interesting report came in that had Gunther sitting upright in his chair. &quot;Bronco's squad was killed?&quot; he pressed the messenger who had just delivered the news.</p><p>&quot;Five bodies, dead. The prisoner is dead and beheaded for some unknown reason - Bronco and Damian are missing. We suspect Bronco might be dead or captured by the Seven Snakes...&quot; The messenger held a solemn expression. The news of the prisoner dying sent shockwaves through the hideout, many of the fighters stunned at the 'failure'.</p><p>Gunther kept silent for a brief moment, his hands clasped together as he rested his elbows on the operation table. &quot;Call off the operation. All members are to return to their respective cells immediately. Stall any pursuit.&quot;</p><p>The council got to work, hurriedly calling off the rescue mission. Their faces were clearly disheartened, the morale plummeting significantly, some having lost friends for a sacrifice that did not amount to much in the end. Gunther clearly noticed the change in atmosphere, prompting him to stand up and raise himself to his full height. &quot;Brothers and sisters. We have not failed. We have succeeded!&quot;</p><p>The declaration caught the other members off-guard, confusion clear in their faces as they looked towards Gunther. &quot;But Brother Long Hua is dead!&quot; A council member countered.</p><p>&quot;And would you rather he be tortured, enslaved against his will, suffering in a cell where he may never see the sun again? It is true that we did not save him, but we most certainly tried. And today, we succeeded in proving that the union is as united as ever, bound together by code, loyalty and morals in solidarity to the cause!&quot; Gunther asserted, clenching his fist as he pumped his arm into the air. &quot;We've shown the city that we would never let one of our own be taken against their will, not without a fight! And anyone who dares to stand against us would have to suffer terrible casualties and pay the price. This is the day when we truly establish ourselves as the pinnacle of the revolution, the spearhead of the fight against inequality and selfishness, against despair and hopelessness. Brother Long Hua would have been proud today, that he died for a better future that he would never see. For a future where all men are equal!&quot;</p><p>&quot;For men of equal shall inherit the world!&quot; The hideout reverberated with a resounding chant, boosting the morale back upwards.</p><p>&quot;Now, we have our own fighters to save. Their families are waiting for their return, as do all of us. Save them all!&quot;</p><p>The retreat was rapid and decentralized, the fighters streaming back to the nearest hideouts and diffusing toward their original cell's location. Before long, the battle had come to an end, leaving the major streets a wreck, with countless billboards and lampposts toppled over and fragments of glass, rock, and flesh strewn all over the pavements. Searchlights and patrol squads of both enforcers, Red Lions and Seven Snakes alike hunted any clues or inklings of the union.</p><p>Intermittent explosions send spiraling pillars of smog and fumes into the sky, the night air filled with panicked shouts from violent raids on hidden cellars in every nook and cranny. No matter how hard the union tried to cover their tracks, somehow each hiding hole was rooted out one by one. As the night wore on, the council became increasingly distressed as news of the cell groups falling like dominos were incessant.</p><p>&quot;They have us on lock, it’s like they know exactly where we were going to retreat to!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The prisoner himself was a trap, a ploy to lure us out and expose our positions, we should have never mobilized a force as large as we had!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We had no choice, our brother needed our help!&quot;</p><p>While the council bickered over the rights and wrongs, Gunther could already see the writing on the wall. &quot;Brothers, no matter what comes, we will stand strong till the dawn. Fight! Fight to the death! There will be no compromise, no retreat. If they come to us, we will never forgo the cause!&quot;</p><p>&quot;For the union!&quot; The remaining fighters in the hideout rallied behind Gunther's words, preparing for the toughest battles of their lives. Even the injured mustered what strength they could, helping to prop up temporary makeshift barricades and distributing additional homemade weapons to those who did not have rifles nor armor.</p><p>While defenses and traps were being placed, Gunther leaned over to his nearest council member. &quot;We will leave eventually. Leave them to their fate - if we die, the union will be no more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Understood, brother.&quot;</p><p>Four of the council followed Gunther as they snuck out of the hideout, covering their own tracks from their very own members, and traveled to a different hideout, a fortified bunker hidden below a building through a mechanical shaft, covered precariously by what seemed to be a sewer drainage cover. The five of them clambered down the small ladder, descending into the depths where stores of food, water and weapons enough to last them three months were well-stocked and arranged neatly. This was one of but the many retreats that Gunther himself has built up over the years in Raktor, before his unfortunate capture by Leo.</p><p>As soon as he descended the ladder into the main hallway lit by bright arctech lanterns. he was greeted by Bronco who was covered in grime and blood from head to toe, the head of Guang Hwa displayed prominently on a table behind him. &quot;Well done, Brother. It must have been hard.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anything for the cause.&quot; Bronco nodded. &quot;But why did we decide to meet here? Once the fighters know that we have abandoned them, they might turn on us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No doubt that with so many of our fighters exposed, our hideouts will eventually be traced back by their movements. Even if they tell of what they know, only the few of us know of this bunker. They would never be able to find us here. We shall wait a day or two before announcing our survival to the city, thereby earning our legend as resistance fighters to the end. The word of our escape can be easily dismissed as rumors planted by the gangs and the enforcers to discredit us.&quot; Gunther explained as he reached forward to place his hands on Guang Hwa's head, sighing slightly to himself. &quot;The path of a revolutionary is vicious and ruthless, yet necessary if we want to succeed. Do you understand, Bronco?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, Gunther.&quot; Bronco found his wording to be a bit strange.</p><p>&quot;What do the rest of you think?&quot; Gunther spoke calmly, turning to face the other four council members. &quot;Do you agree?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, Gunther. To be a revolutionary is to forsake the world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then one of you is clearly lying. We have a mole amidst us. One who has been working with the Seven Snakes in an effort to topple the very revolution you swore your lives to. You have one chance to step forward, and maybe you will live.&quot;</p><p>The others were startled, their eyes shifting to each other in shock and suspicion, wondering who among them was the true traitor. &quot;How do you know there is a mole? What if the mole was part of the council that was left behind?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Impossible. Only the five of us here knew the full extent of every cell group in operation. I would be even more surprised if there was not a mole-&quot; Gunther was about to grab Bronco's rifle in a bid to elicit a confession, only to suddenly hear the grating sound of the drainage cover being shifted aside along the street. &quot;Someone's coming.&quot;</p><p>The council kicked into action, rushing for the stored rifles and handguns and taking cover, aiming their guns right at the last step of the descending ladder, ready to fire at a moment's notice. Gunther too wielded a rifle of his own, staring down the iron sights while nodding to Bronco, who armed an similar incapacitating gas grenade, preparing to throw it.</p><p>Without warning, two figures dropped from the shaft, not even bothering to climb down the ladder as their knees buckled, kicking up the dormant dust from the floor. Instantly all of the council fired at them, only for the pellets to be deflected by a strong arctech tower shield, wielded by Damian himself. &quot;Time for payback.&quot;</p><p>The pellets ricocheted around the room in a dazzling display, nearly nicking the ears of one of the council members. &quot;Bronco, NOW!&quot; Gunther roared as he too began to fire at Damian. However, it was far too late, the second figure already lunging forward in three leaps to the nearest council member, her magical falchion lobbing off the council member's arm in one fell swoop, the disembered limb flailing into the air while its owner let out a shriek of pain.</p><p>&quot;Bronco? Bronco!&quot; Gunther turned only to see Bronco frozen with fear, suffering from the trauma of Sasha's assault during his prison rescue attempt. Gunther grunted as he focused on saving his own life, swiveling his aim to the vanishing Sasha, trying to get a lock.</p><p>He watched helplessly as his pellets went wide, Sasha unhindered and maiming each of the council members one by one. Before long, only Gunther and Bronco were left standing, the rest whimpering on the ground while a third figure entered through the shaft, his cloak fluttering from the impact. &quot;Mister Gunther, or should I say, Ki Hwang. What a pleasure to finally meet you properly.&quot;</p><p>Before Gunther could react, he heard the hiss of a gas mask behind, the familiar purple gas streaking forwards and enveloping him. He involuntarily breathed in the intoxicating gas, choking and gasping for air as he staggered to his knees, watching in horror as Bronco tossed the grenade right under Gunther's feet. &quot;Sorry, brother. I had no choice...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bronco, you...!&quot; Gunther's voice was hoarse as he clutched his throat, trying to stem the effects of the gas as best as he could. His muscles still in control, he swung his rifle around to Bronco, pulling the trigger without hesitation. The shot caught Bronco off-guard, the pellet breaking his gas mask and lodging deep into his eye, the eyeball twisted into a pulp while Bronco cried out in pain.</p><p>&quot;Kyle!&quot; Gunther grunted in anger, reaching deep into his shirt before the gas took over and drawing a palm-sized metallic totem, the cracks in it beginning to flash red. &quot;You won't be leaving this place alive, not if I have a choice!&quot;</p><p>Kyle squinted in suspicion at the mysterious handheld arctech device, Sasha and Damian immediately keeping a clear distance, unsure of what was about to happen.</p><p>&quot;Now, all three of you will die her-URK!&quot; Gunther's proclamation was interrupted as the device began to rip apart Gunther's flesh, turning his own muscles into meaty tendrils that snaked along his arm and strangle him. Each sinew of flesh tore their way into every orifice they could find on Gunther's body, twisting and lodging themselves deep within his innards while his eyes stared in horror, clearly not expecting this effect. He tried to let go of the device, but his hand was locked firmly in place due to the purple gas, his body no longer responding.</p><p>&quot;The device is killing him!&quot; Damian shouted, but Kyle was already one step ahead, rushing forward and trying to tear apart the tendrils that were rooting themselves all over Gunther's body. The tendrils swarmed together and lashed out towards Kyle, who ripped them apart with his bare hands easily. Yet, more and more of Gunther's flesh was being stripped to form new tendrils, as if he was the new breeding ground for a demonic monster that was hellbent on devouring everything living in reach.</p><p>Kyle got close enough to Gunther's flailing body, using his fingers to pry the device from Gunther's undying grip, but even he could not overpower the unnatural strength. &quot;Sasha, sword!&quot; Kyle motioned with a free hand, Sasha tossing her falchion over to Kyle immediately without hesitation. In one swift motion, he used the blade to cut off Gunther's wrist, the enhanced edge slicing cleanly through the bone.</p><p>The horrifying device clattered onto the ground, before its unnerving invisible aura suddenly expanded, enveloping the bunker as strips of skin on everyone within range began to twist into similar tendrils, jabbing sharply at the faces of their owners. The council members screamed as their bodies turned against them, one even dying as his own eyelids turned inwards, the modified flesh carving right through his brain and yanking grey matter out. Damian and Sasha retreated, attempting to escape the limits of the aura but to no avail. Even Kyle watched as his own skin began to peel in small strands, revealing the red flesh beneath while the newly formed tendrils tried to lunge at his eyes.</p><p><em>Arcia Disruption!</em></p><p>The device's engraving colors and invisible aura instantly swapped, turning brown instead of red as a disgusting, putrid stench of a decaying corpse began to emit from it, the vomit-inducing smell enveloping the whole bunker. Damian nearly gagged as the council, while Sasha's eyes watered. Kyle himself smothered his own nose with the edge of his sleeve, preventing the horrid scent from disorientating him. The animated tendrils instantly disintegrated, leaving the survivors panting and wincing from the exposed flesh. Damian tossed Sasha a small health potion flask, healing up the minor wounds while he stabilized the remaining council members.</p><p>Kyle knelt next to the dying Gunther, healing him with his necklace of healing. The soft green glow alleviated the internal bleeding, but it was far from strong enough. Even feeding a full health potion flask did not stop the numerous internal wounds from closing up, Gunther's life slowly fading.</p><p>&quot;Sasha, Damian, get Gunther and the rest back to Haui immediately. I want them alive.&quot; Kyle ordered, the two immediately complying and calling in a wagon to haul the injured away for further interrogation, while he continued to attempt to stem the bleeding. Sasha scoured the bunker for medical equipment or additional potions, passing them to Kyle in an effort to stabilize Gunther. He took the spare time to pat Gunther down, checking his clothes for any other strange arctech devices or trackers, a habit he picked up a lifetime ago.</p><p>Soon, a team of Seven Snakes and a wagon came to pick up the injured. &quot;Guard the wagon, make sure no union fighter finds out about it.&quot; Kyle had Sasha and Damian escort the wagon just in case there was a third party angling for it. He wouldn't put it past Leo of the Red Lions or even Bishop Vernette to swoop in and claim his prize. While he eventually had to hand them over to the enforcers, there were still a multitude of questions he had, especially after all that had happened.</p><p>He began to inspect the bunker, trying to figure out who exactly was funding them. The stores of food and supplies were unnatural in volume, far beyond what Count Leon and the Red Lions would have provided them with. Clearly someone was helping them, and Kyle did not think that there was another mole in the Seven Snakes capable of pulling off such a feat.</p><p>Kyle picked up the strange arctech device in his hand, feeling the clearly machined grooves and surface, detailed with a precision level reminiscent of a high-tech factory. The engravings were far more intricate than anything he had ever seen so far in Raktor, showing a level of arctech engineering beyond what he was familiar with. Not even the military-grade armor or weapons that he had developed thus far came close.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Flesh Warper</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>Harrison Industries?</em> Kyle began to check the rest of the bunkers, noticing many of the supplies were coming directly from Versia, including the unique rocket launcher that took out the prisoner convoy. He sifted through the various belongings of those who had lived in the bunker over time. Multiple records and parchments of delivery timings and rotations of watches were noted, along with a list of supplies and goods.</p><p>Soon, the rest of the Seven Snakes guards showed up, entering the bunker en masse led by Niko, who was awed by the size of the bunker. &quot;Fucking.... they built all of this in two months?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hardly. It seems to have been utilized over three years.&quot; Kyle replied as he flipped through an old logbook on a dusty desk, scanning the entries within. There were clear dates next to crossed out lines, along with coded agent names, all apparently dispatched from Versia by a group only know as Nest. <em>Haui did mention about Nest before, I'll need to have a chat with him.</em></p><p>&quot;So what do we do now? We got the bastards. We should reorganize and solidify our control now. Better yet, this will be the perfect time to launch an attack on the Red Lions,&quot; Niko suggested.</p><p>&quot;No. My deal was to crush the union, and we shall do that. We do not fight anyone else. Instead, I'm far more interested in where this Harrison is supplying the union from. Have these few crates brought back to the base for research and inspection.&quot; It was clear with the enforcers, nobles and gangs all working against the union, the Versians must have had a smuggling route into Raktor that was near undetectable. <em>Gunther must have had a point of contact as well. Where is he?</em></p><p>With Gunther and the council now in his hands, his side of the deal was now done. Kyle could simply hand over the rest of the operation to the enforcers. Yet the involvement of Harrison with advanced arctech made it even more important to get as much information as he could. He did not forget that the Galactic Era personal shield worn by Makoa had also passed through Harrison's hands. <em>Not to mention the Ancient Exosuit Spine being from Versia too.</em></p><p>Now that so much technology of his time was seen coming from Verisa, Kyle felt the need more than ever to figure out the true source of all this technology. <em>And perhaps I will find my answers in these so-called ruins.</em></p><p>[Sir, Bronco is still alive.] Damian reported.</p><p>&quot;Keep him there, I'm on my way. Prepare Gunther for interrogation as well.&quot; Kyle prepared to leave, bringing a few pieces of evidence back when a smattering of footsteps began to swarm the ladder, angry shouts echoing through the shafts before a Seven Snakes guard was thrown down the ladder, prompting Niko to hurriedly block the guard's fall.</p><p>Before Kyle could inform the rest of the Seven Snakes in the bunker to prepare, a man bristling in red gaseous tentacles dropped in, his landing softened by the aura condensing at his feet. &quot;So, it seems the information was right. You were financing the radical union and preventing us from crushing them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good to finally meet you to, Leo.&quot; Kyle adjusted his cloak's collar, staring at the Red Lion's leader as the rest of the Seven Snakes aimed their rifles at him. &quot;But I'm afraid you're mistaken. I merely cleaned up after you. All radical union leaders have been captured.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Funny. Don't you mean protected?&quot; Leo gritted his teeth. &quot;Hand over the union leaders, or things will get nasty here.&quot;</p><p>Kyle gave Leo a closer glance, noticing the distinct purple leather cloak with the insignia of the Red Lions emblazoned on its shoulders. The red gaseous tentacles split into five unique arms, drifting and snaking their ways towards the other Seven Snakes guards. None of the guards flinched, waiting for the order, but Kyle seemed wholly unimpressed with the threat that Leo posed. &quot;You are more than welcome to try.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I could gut you like a leguswhale fin by fin before you even made a move.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure you want to? &quot;</p><p>The pause in response from the hesitant Leo was all it took for Kyle to let out a condescending snort, infuriating Leo even further. &quot;Don't think you can walk away scott-free. I want compensation!&quot;</p><p>Kyle raised an eyebrow. &quot;Compensation? Now that's a funny word.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You engineered this entire radical union uprising against my men, my people.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And how much is this proposed compensation supposed to be?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Two hundred million rakels. For the wanton destruction of businesses and property all across my districts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Interesting....&quot;</p><p>&quot;Interesting?! You...!&quot; Leo launched a tendril of gas right at Kyle, stopping inches before the nose, Kyle not even flinching a single inch, staring down the tendril. Leo instinctively recoiled, retracting the tendril as a sliver of fright began to appear on his face, as though he had a close shave with death.</p><p>For it was not the pride of Kyle that instilled fear into him - it was the utter discipline that the Seven Snakes guards surrounding showed. If any enemy had tried to do that to him, his own Red Lions would have pulled the trigger immediately. The fact that they didn't show the sheer level of confidence the Seven Snakes guards had in Kyle's prowess. <em>He... he is on par with Ares Ulras! Or even beyond...</em></p><p>&quot;Are you finished with your theatrics?&quot; Kyle's mouth curled into a smile, as he stepped forward slowly, approaching Leo who fought every base instinct in his body that told him to run. &quot;Let's be very clear with each other, as fellow concerned citizens of Raktor.&quot;</p><p>Kyle's voice was barely audible as he leisurely circled Leo, step by step. &quot;Your men are exhausted from an uprising you fostered from the very beginning. I know your attack plans. I know the deal you had with Count Leon. And I know where every single one of your commanders is, thanks to a certain captured Left Paw.&quot;</p><p>Leo was frozen in place, the tendrils dangling helplessly in mid-air when the tension was finally interrupted by another arrival, the sliver pauldrons and distinctive cap of the inquisitor flashing as Mason slid down the ladder with grace, landing right behind Leo. Mason surveyed the bunker cautiously, noticing the tense standoff while Bishop Vernette entered as well. &quot;Seems like I'm interrupting,&quot; Mason remarked.</p><p>&quot;Not at all, Inquisitor. Just reminding a wayward citizen of how the city works.&quot; Kyle held a genial smile, his eyes still boring holes into Leo.</p><p>&quot;Need I remind you both, that starting a gang war right now does not mean the enforcers will stand by idly. I think we had more than enough disruptions for one month in the South Sector. Don't push my generosity. You two, stand down right this instant.&quot; Mason warned.</p><p>Kyle motioned with his hands to the Seven Snakes guards to lower their weapons, while Leo retracted the tendrils into his body, the gas seemingly seeping back into his hand.</p><p>&quot;Now, where is Gunther?&quot; Bishop Vernette asked Kyle pointedly, clearly noticing none of the union leaders here.</p><p>&quot;I am holding them for questioning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Count wants them in front of him in the morning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And he shall have his prisoners by then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't listen to him! He's clearly protecting them! The Seven Snakes are in cahoots with the radicals!&quot; Leo finally mustered enough courage to speak back out, buoyed by the presence of the enforcers, yet he found no solace within the Bishop's and Inquisitor's pitying gazes.</p><p>Bishop Vernette waved her hands dismissively. &quot;Enough, Leo. I think you've done well enough. In the morning, I will report your assistance favorably to the Count.&quot;</p><p>Leo wore an external look of anger, but deep down he was slightly relieved to not have to face Kyle. However, when he turned around to climb the ladder back up, he found Niko and three other Seven Snakes guards blocking his way. &quot;Who said you could get away scott-free?&quot; Kyle's voice rang out.</p><p>&quot;Seven Snakes! Don't you dare-&quot; Bishop Vernette started, but quickly held her tongue the moment her eyes' met Kyle's.</p><p>&quot;Please do not interfere, my dear Bishop. This is a business matter between gentlemen.&quot; Kyle's voice was polite, but his demeanor was far from it. It felt as though a menace from hell had manifested on the earth itself, walking towards Leo, who began to stiffen up.</p><p>&quot;Wh-what do you want?&quot; Leo mumbled with obvious fear in his voice, while Inquisitor Mason was surprised at just how meek the leader of the Red Lions could be. The last time he heard of anything equivalent was when Leo met Ares Ulras of the Ardent Cretins.</p><p>&quot;I'm here to offer you your compensation of course.&quot; Kyle mocked. &quot;Despite your intentions against my businesses, I think this would be a valid compensation for your troubles: I will not pillage, raid and sack your entire territory of supplies and retrieve my stolen weapons and armor. You will turn the stolen goods over to the enforcers and the Count, while paying me in equal for what you stole. I -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ridiculous!&quot; Leo interrupted Kyle. &quot;You can't be the only gang in the South Sector wielding such equipment! The balance of power will be - &quot;</p><p><em>Intimidation Aura!</em></p><p>His own words were lodged in his throat as the undeniable wave of pressure surged onto him, the weight of world seemingly pressing down while Kyle near him with each step, the same calm smile still plastered on his face. &quot;You speak as if you even have a say. Interrupt me again at your peril. Understood?&quot;</p><p>Leo tried to speak, but his body refused to budge, the intimidation aura suppressing him heavily as he struggled to even breathe properly. Every fiber of his being screamed danger, even though his mind knew he needed to stand up for himself. Instead, he shuddered for a brief moment, before nodding vigorously in response.</p><p>&quot;Now, I do not care whether or not your businesses are standing - you will complete payment and delivery within two months, or face the consequence. Is that clear, Mane of the Red Lion? Or should I write it down on paper to help make it clearer for you?&quot;</p><p>Another nod from Leo.</p><p>The aura retracted as quickly as it began, Leo finally able to gasp for air while Kyle patted him on the shoulder. &quot;Good. Pleasure doing business with you. Off you go now, better hurry home. Ophelia needs help getting down the stairs, she isn't doing too well lately, isn't she? I can offer my support should your wife need any healing.&quot;</p><p>Leo didn't bother responding, only quickly sliding past the grinning Niko and clambering up the ladder with his tail between his legs. Bishop Vernette sighed at the sight of Kyle sending Leo packing but still did not expect anything different. True to his word, Kyle had now full control of the union and put the Red Lion to heel in one singular masterplan, the Bishop wondering if Kyle was secretly a legendary royal from the Hwa Dynasty.</p><p>&quot;Now then, I have other matters to attend to. You will have Gunther before the morning. The scene is yours, Bishop. Inquisitor.&quot; Kyle nodded, before climbing up the ladder himself with the Seven Snakes guards in tow, leaving the enforcers to gather whatever was left of the evidence. Niko carried a crate filled to the brim with the same incapacitating grenades back with them as well, Kyle intent on learning their secrets.</p><p>As they returned to the prison, where the union leaders were being treated, Kyle had the unconscious Gunther hauled to a solitary cell. &quot;Is he stabilized?&quot; He asked Haui, who was overseeing the healing process while two assistants were monitoring the prisoner's breathing rate and pulse.</p><p>&quot;We've managed to seal most of the wounds and purge some of the toxins. The incapacitating gas's effects are still lingering in his system, which means his speech might be slurred or he would not be able to talk normally now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. I'll need about ten metal needles and five pairs of lab gloves.&quot;</p><p>Haui held a confused look on his face even as he complied. &quot;If you're planning to experiment on him, I can have my assistants do any procedure you need.&quot;</p><p>Kyle snapped the slightly loose gloves on, a snug fit with his hands as he flexed his fingers. &quot;Sometimes it requires a personal touch to have a civilized conversation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 94 - Hitmen</strong></p><p>The stinging chill of ice cubes mixed with water smattered against Gunther's face, the water causing him to splutter awake as he tried to get his bearings. A snap of the fingers shook him out of his stupor and brought his attention to the man standing calmly in front of him, the man's arms crossed while fiddling with a metal needle in his gloved hand.</p><p>Gunther tried to move, but found his limbs restrained to a chair by thick metal chains, his body stark naked save for a single piece of underwear, the thin fabric hardly concealing his genitals. A sluggish feeling dominated his body, but his mind was clear as day.</p><p>He attempted to shrug off the chain before realizing something was wrong as he glanced down at his right arm, which had been amputated without his knowledge. A sudden jolt of phantom pain from the nerve endings of his stumped arm arced through his flesh, Gunther clenching his jaw to prevent the urge to shout in pain.</p><p>&quot;A loss of a hand is hardly anything to worry about, isn't that right, Brother Ki Hwang?&quot; The man spoke calmly.</p><p>&quot;You don't know the meaning behind the word 'Brother'.&quot; Gunther hissed through gritted teeth, his body involuntarily flexing his missing right hand on instinct only to find nothing.</p><p>&quot;I know more about the word than the one who ordered the death of Brother Long Hua.&quot; The man mocked, the needle twirling between his fingers deftly while Gunther struggled against the chains fiercely, intent on strangling the man, but his body was sluggish and lethargic.</p><p>&quot;Born in Tenar, lived in the slums until you were adopted by the temples, upon which you graduated your disciple training with flying colors.&quot; The man continued, circling Gunther.</p><p>Gunther didn't speak, though his heart was already in turmoil, knowing Guang Hwa had spilled everything on him.</p><p>&quot;You were raised alongside Long Hua, trained to spread the word of the Goddess Nona in order to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Keep her name out of your filthy mouth, you fucking corrupt scum.&quot; Gunther snarled.</p><p>&quot;Corrupt scum? Why, I believe you and I, we are the same.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am nothing like you. Kyle, or should I say, Alvin Teras. Slaver, hoarder, a disgusting shit stain on the world, only seeking to reap reward for selfish profit. A sociopath who only chases power! No sense of family, honor or respect for human life - a vile being that should have never been birthed!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Am I? It seems that people think differently. Right now, both the union and the people are cheering for the Seven Snakes for upholding wages and bringing back security and peace to the district. Most likely they now hail me as a champion for society, for the greater good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Peace?! Greater Good?! You?! The union that cheers for you is not my union. My brothers and comrades will fight to the death and spread our cause to the four corners-&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I have a map of every single hideout in the South Sector. We have already raided half of them in this night alone. By the morning, your 'brothers' who you abandoned will be either dead or captured. There is no union for you any longer, only mine.&quot;</p><p>Gunther thrashed as hard as he could, the metal chains rattling against the chair while the chair's legs grated against the floor. &quot;YOU FUCKING SLIMY BASTARD! Once I'm free -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Free? Who said anything about releasing you?&quot; Kyle chuckled, but Gunther remained confident.</p><p>&quot;Threaten all you want, but I know Count Leon wants me. At some point, you will have to let me go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed. Count Leon wants you in the morning. Which gives us plenty of time to have a civilized conversation.&quot; Kyle placed the metal needle down.</p><p>&quot;I have nothing to say to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There's no need to put up a facade any longer - the union's survival is hardly your concern any longer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unlike your selfish perspective,I have something I believe in beyond my personal gain!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me guess what you believe in: you believe that you will survive as Count Leon's prisoner. The nobles will not dare to execute you lest you become a martyr, so you will be imprisoned indefinitely, upon which someone will break you out of prison through a twist of wit and sly words.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Save the ramblings of a daydream for someone else.&quot; Gunther retorted snidely, but there was a clear unmistakable sign of shock, the upper left corner of his mouth twitching slightly before being suppressed.</p><p>&quot;You're wondering why I know your entire sequence of moves. You wonder why I allowed the union to flourish. You can't understand why I gave into every union demand and somehow managed to predict all of this. The answer is obvious: we are two sides of the same coin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bullshit. I have morals.&quot; Gunther hissed.</p><p>&quot;Enough morals to sacrifice men, women and children alike in the pursuit of an unattainable ideal. How many lives have you ended at your own hands yourself? The former leadership of the craft union, the landowners, even your own brethren to cover up your tracks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're one to talk - you kill, maim, enslave without a care in the world, and to a meaningless end. When your knees buckle under the weight of your endless sins, no one will be there to save you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not the one professing to follow a divine cause, nor did said divine cause implore me to do otherwise. I hardly believe that a benevolent Goddess would condone a violent revolutionary twisting her words to serve a more sinister purpose.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is the only method to rid shitstains like you from this broken world. There is no sin in that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately for you, it is the punisher who determines what a sin is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only the Goddess has the right to punish me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then call her. Call her right this very instant.&quot; Kyle grinned. &quot;Because right now, only divine intervention can save you.&quot;</p><p>Before Gunther could retort, Kyle deftly spun the metal needle in his right hand, reaching over with his left to Gunther's last good arm and clamping it down tightly against the holster of the metal chair.</p><p>Without a word nor a sign of concern, Kyle aimed the tip of the metal needle right beneath the fingernails of Gunther's trembling fingers, the sharp, pointed end slowly twisting into the soft, raw flesh and drawing beads of blood. The prickling pain was impossible to ignore, Gunther clenching his jaw as hard as he could to ignore the jolts of pain surging from his fingers. &quot;The Goddess works through my brothers, and they shall be the ones who will save me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It seems that you have failed to fully comprehend the severity of your situation.&quot; Kyle sighed. &quot;Not a single soul save for those closest to me knows where this cell is. Your union does not stand a chance. Even if they are able to locate you, none of them will be able to break through our defenses.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What makes you think such empty threats will break me?&quot; Gunther snorted. &quot;All I have to do is wait until Count Leon asks for my transfer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still confident in your plan, I see. Hinging your survival on being Count Leon's prisoner.&quot; Kyle drew another metal needle from his packet. &quot;But there is one critical flaw in all of that.&quot;</p><p>Kyle lunged and grabbed Gunther's face, his fingers prying apart the eyelids of Gunther's left eye while the other hand aimed the tip right at the quivering moist pupils.</p><p>&quot;Who said I had to give you over in one piece?&quot;</p><p>Gunther let out a loud roar as the needle was jabbed in, puncturing the frail surface of the eyeball and rupturing the nerves inside. The pain was immeasurable, Kyle leaving the half-embedded metal needle inside. With every slight movement of Gunther's eyes, the needle sent never-ending waves of excruciating pain into his body. Even clenching his eyelids were of no help as blood gushed over, streaming down his cheek.</p><p>&quot;Now, let's talk - who is your point of contact with Harrison Industries?&quot;</p><p>Gunther heaved heavily as he continuously winced with the metal needle lodged in. He stared at Kyle using his good eye with a resigned expression as he heard Kyle's question before his mouth slowly twisted into a grin and broke out into raucous laughter, the pain of the metal needle seemingly gone. &quot;Truly a frog in the well. And I here I thought you knew everything! So even the supposed omnipotent <em>Kyle</em> is unaware, HAHAHA!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So be it. If we can't have a civilized conversation—&quot; Kyle snapped his fingers, prompting two other Seven Snakes guards to enter. Then I'll wait until you're ready. Make him spill everything on Harrison Industries.&quot;</p><p>Even as Kyle handed the role of torturer over to his men, Gunther still maintained an unnerving grin while Kyle left the cell. The sudden mood change caught Kyle off-guard, instilling doubt into his plans. He pulled out an arctech radio from his coat, calling Damian. &quot;Is everything in place? Any signs of an attack?&quot;</p><p>[Nothing yet, sir. No movement outside the prison. Sasha is patrolling the vicinity. The remnants of the unions are scrambling towards the ends of the Sector, some already fleeing past the boundary. Should we chase them down?]</p><p>&quot;No, that would constitute an overreach. Let the other Barons handle it themselves.&quot; Kyle wasn't about to clean up more than was required, conserving his resources.</p><p>[Got it. I will ens-] The radio suddenly cut out mid-conversation, regurgitating static, Kyle squinting in suspicion. He tried to tune in to the other channels only to be met with more static as well. <em>Not good.</em> &quot;Sasha, come in&quot;</p><p>[Yes, sir?]</p><p>&quot;Looks like the telepathic arcia engraving still works. Is your arctech radio working?&quot;</p><p>[Testing now... no sir, it's not.]</p><p>&quot;We're being jammed. Get Damian and his men to high alert now.&quot;</p><p>[Understood. Should I - URK!] Sasha's telepathic voice faded out as well in an instant.</p><p>&quot;Sasha? Sasha?&quot; Kyle tried to contact her, but upon the third failure, he didn't waste any more time, marching up to the idling guards waiting outside the various cells. &quot;We're under attack. Sound an alarm. Plan DR.&quot;</p><p>The guards' eyes widened with shock before kicking into high gear, scrambling about to arm themselves and stock up on ammunition and health potions from a nearby storage rack.</p><p>While the men began to set up defensive barricades and blockade against the main entrance, Kyle double-checked his weapons available once more to him, positioning himself in the hallway right outside Gunther's cell. He couldn't recall the last time Sasha had lost to anyone but him during training. <em>Whoever is coming must be strong.</em></p><p>From inside the cell, Gunther's laughter filled the air. &quot;My savior arrives! I have not been forsaken by the Goddess!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Check all possible entrances. Cover each vent and window now!&quot; Kyle roared to the rest of his men, arming himself with the Oriental Bloom handgun.</p><p>Time seemed to slow to a crawl for Kyle and the others, each laugh from Gunther the only thing marking the passage of time save for their own tense breaths, waiting for the imminent attack.</p><p>Yet minutes passed, with nothing happening at all. Only the silent wind and usual din of Raktor's nightlife could be heard at all, the Seven Snakes guards beginning to lose their tension and attention.</p><p>&quot;Focus - he will strike when it is most-&quot; Kyle's attempt to rally the guards was interrupted by a sudden collapse of the ceiling right above him. He instinctively ducked out of the way as two figures tumbled down along with the rubble with an enveloping cloud of dust. However, Kyle's sharp instincts had him immediately swivel the Oriental Bloom towards the second figure, firing a pre-emptive shot.</p><p>Instead of drawing blood and eliciting a pained cry, the fast pellet was instead deflected by an armored arm, covered from tip to base in engravings that barely glowed.</p><p>Kyle didn't relent, firing shot after shot and forcing the wielder of the armored arm to block them. While the wielder's attention was on Kyle, the first figure accelerated behind the second, her left arm's arcia tattoo swinging a dazzling falchion that threatened to take off the head of the wielder.</p><p>Yet the falchion only chopped through the cloud of dust, the wielder ducking and crouching low, before delivering a rear kick that nailed the first figure right in the guts. The fearsome hit caused her to gag and tumble away out of the pile of rubble towards the stunned Seven Snakes guards, who were finally shaken awake from their stupor the moment they recognized the first figure.</p><p>&quot;Protect Sasha!&quot; A guard roared, forming a line between the bleeding Sasha and the attacker, who was unrecognizable under a black face mask and helmet. They fired immediately, the attacker's armored arm surface flaring to form an arm shield that blocked most of the pellets. Some pellets ricocheted off the dense shield, injuring the guards as they bounced around the hallway.</p><p>Just as the attacker was about to charge ahead, alarm bells rang in the attacker's head, an intimidating presence bursting out behind him, a neon-red hammer aimed right for his head.</p><p>The attacker dodged again, but Kyle did not let him recover, swinging blow after blow in a violent combo. As the head of the hammer slammed into the armored arm, a devastating reverberation sent shockwaves through both of them, forcing Kyle to retreat as his arm became slightly numb.</p><p><em>Penchant for Violence!</em></p><p>Before the attacker could get into a proper fighting posture, Kyle was already three steps ahead of him, each blow targeting other parts of the attacker instead.</p><p>Surprisingly, the armor on the other limbs was less resistant than the armored arm, allowing for the neon-red hammer to easily inflict damage on the attacker directly.</p><p>Yet the attacker remained resilient, blocking and dodging when he could, even as the Seven Snakes guards flanked him with pellet shots as well. The skill level was unimaginable, the attacker showing no signs of giving up. The moment Kyle swung his hammer wide again, a familiar purple gas wafted forwards from his arm, spreading quickly through the hallway.</p><p>Kyle hurriedly leapt back from the expanding incapacitating smoke, retrieving a gas mask from his coat and strapping it on quickly. Rushing into the smoke, he found the attacker completely missing, save for the door to Gunther's cell being wide open.</p><p>Kyle dashed to the entrance, only to see a gleeful Gunther laughing at the two dead Seven Snakes guards, their necks crushed by the armored arm of the attacker unceremoniously.</p><p>&quot;Looks like you're not so great after, Kyle! And once I get my brothers together again, you will be dead in no-&quot; Gunther's words were stuck in his throat, his mind trying to speak the words yet only finding nothing coming up, instead feeling a sharp pain at the back of his neck, a strange syringe plunging deep into his nervous system.</p><p>Kyle hurriedly shot the Oriental Bloom at the attacker, forcing the attacker away from Gunther, but it was already far too late. Whatever was in the syringe was spreading rapidly, fueled by Gunther's own heartbeat as its progress was visible through the discoloration of his veins across his skin.</p><p>Everywhere the discoloration spread, Gunther's skin peeled off, as if it had been dried under the sun for decades, disintegrating into dust while his muscles visibly degraded. Gunther's body shuddered violently as he tried to resist the effect, but soon he had nearly no skin left, only the raw flesh beneath, which was also slowly turning to ooze and slime. Soon, all that remained was a husk of its former self, the flesh dying rapidly.</p><p>The attacker took the moment of shock as an opportunity, leaping over Kyle in a bid to escape through the cell's door.</p><p>Instead, a tight iron grip clasped around the attacker's ankle, slamming him down into the cold hard concrete, which cracked violently. &quot;Don't even think about leaving.&quot; Kyle twisted his body, pinning the attacker down. The armored arm's engravings surged into life, allowing the attacker to grapple Kyle back on his wrist, the metallic fist threatening to crush it.</p><p><em>This is My Turf!</em></p><p>The sudden defensive barrier crushed the attacker and his armored arm right into the floor, as well as pushing apart the incapacitating gas to have Kyle get a clear view on the attacker for the first time.</p><p><em>This arm...</em> &quot;Where did you get this arm?&quot;</p><p>The attacker tried to struggle free, before realizing it was futile. Instead a spark of fire erupted from the attacker's chest, a familiar scene to Kyle himself. <em>The same thing happened when Reese was kidnapped!</em></p><p>Kyle quickly manipulated his barrier, allowing only the armored arm to enter as an allied object. Immediately the difference in force ruptured the attacker's arm out of its socket, the foundation of the prison shuddering violently under the crushing weight.</p><p>Before the self-immolation could take place, the attacker had already been flattened to a pulp save for the armored arm which dangled lifelessly on the ground.</p><p>[Sir!] Sasha called out as she, Damian and the other guards rushed in with gas masks, breaking through the gas. The sight was a complete mess - Gunther's half-meat skeleton sitting on a chair still chained, a gruesome paste staining the floor as innard juices flowed freely through the cracks, and two dead Seven Snakes guards.</p><p>&quot;Focus, Gunther is not the only prisoner! Cover the perimeter!&quot; Kyle urged the two of them. &quot;Don't let another get through!&quot;</p><p>&quot;On it, sir!&quot; Damian took charge of the defense, ensuring the area and district were fully secured and ordering the men to split up. Not a single gap was spared in their patrols, the guards checking every nook and cranny.</p><p>As Damian barked orders rapidly, Kyle hardly cared about the dead Gunther and his hitmen. It was obvious that the hitmen were sent by Harrison to eliminate anyone who would leak information. Sure, Gunther was meant to be delivered to Count Leon to be interrogated and imprisoned, but that didn't mean anything in the long term. All Count Leon wanted was for the union to stop messing around in Raktor, and it had already been achieved. Instead, there was a far greater prize that had been delivered to him, right to his doorstep. He knelt next to the armored arm, picking it up and removing the dismembered arm within.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Arcia Exosuit Arm Prototype(Advanced)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><strong>Chapter 95 - Bigger Picture</strong></p><p>Over the next two days, the radical union was slowly losing control over the city, their last pockets of resistance relegated to the edges of the city. Attempts by their local leaders to reach the original council members were only met with silence, the command structure breaking down into disrepair.</p><p>Some returned to being the small, closed clubs or craft unions they used to be, while others strove to ignite the same flame where possible. Yet, with close to no funding available and hardly any real weight with which to bargain, attempts at strikes and protests were crushed heavily by enforcers and gangs across the city. Still, elements of defiance and political unrest rocked the city, some of the nobles themselves sympathetic to the original cause but rejecting the violent methods of the radicals.</p><p>Yet this meant nothing to the vipers gathered at the top of the shopping arcade in a conference room in front of Kyle, who himself was becoming cognizant that he was part of a larger game and scheme.</p><p>&quot;I don't give two shits who this Harrison dumbass is, if he wants a war he'll get a war! You don't kill two of our men in our territory without getting some payback!&quot; Niko slammed his palm on the table in rage. &quot;If we don't fight back, then what about Kismet and Mizar? They gonna die for nothing?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Calm down!&quot; Reese urged. &quot;Do you even understand who the hell Harrison is? He's the number one richest man in Versia, he controls more than a third of the market in his hands alone! Don't even mention the other subsidiaries who 'seemed' to be his competitors but are secretly in league with him. Picking a fight with him is suicide!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Niko is right. Whether or not he is the richest or not means little to us. No matter who messes with us, they'll have something coming for them. If we let this go, we'll be like a laughing stock. All of the nobles and major gangs know we let Gunther die in our hands, it's an absolute stain on our reputation that we've painstakingly built so far.&quot; Keith spoke up.</p><p>&quot;But how are we going to do anything to him? We don't even know what he wants nor what he has?&quot; Monica rebutted. &quot;We're like a blind duck seeking revenge on a non-existent hunter. If we move rashly now, we will be exposing ourselves with each move.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed. Verisa is far beyond our scope of control. If he was in the South Sector or the Culdao Peaks, we might have been able to do something about it right away.&quot; Damian scratched his arm in irritation. &quot;Still, did we not have a point of contact with that Versian Minister...? What's his name again...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Minister Dekar is already a criminal, and on the run for kidnapping Versian President Johan.&quot; Keith reminded them. &quot;Whatever agreement or opportunity we might have had through him is basically lost, unless we can figure out where he is hiding. Their political issues are like a black box to us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If all we're lacking is information, then we simply need to gather it.&quot; Kyle finally interjected, his voice laced with vengeance. &quot;This man, this Harrison has been interfering with our operations for far too long. No doubt he is behind the upheaval in politics there as well.&quot;</p><p>Originally, Kyle was not too peeved at Harrison's actions. It was simply business at the time. He did not believe that Reese's kidnapping nor the poaching of arctech designers were aimed directly at him. However, the funding of the union and scaling far exceeded Kyle's plans, putting his Seven Snakes in danger, not to mention Harrison's own soldier killing Seven Snakes members. Members that he put his own time and effort into recruiting and training.</p><p>&quot;How are we going to collect information? None of us are Versians, right?&quot; Damian mused. &quot;They are notorious for being closed off ever since the revolution.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have Versian workers in our district, they seem pretty open.&quot; Gordon pointed out the factory as an example.</p><p>&quot;Those are the migrants, those willing to leave Versia for a better life. Those who remained aren't the same.&quot; Damian explained.</p><p>&quot;We already have a good selection with us.&quot; Kyle pointed out. &quot;Three of them, in fact.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three? I get that we have Culo, he's probably our best bet by far.&quot; Keith counted on his hands. &quot;Who are the other two?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bronco is one - but it remains to be seen how loyal he can be to us.&quot; Niko got into the groove, following the group's line of thinking.</p><p>&quot;Bronco is far too dangerous to act as an information gatherer. I would think that his betrayal had already raised alarms among Harrison's network about possible infiltration. The same goes for Culo, his face is practically plastered all over the place as being our mouthpiece. It would be near impossible for him to enter undetected, we’ll have to sneak him in.&quot; Kyle tapped the table.</p><p>&quot;Then who else do we have left? Who's the last one?&quot; Eric Dicar frowned.</p><p>&quot;Someone who would never be doubted by Harrison or anyone in Versia. Someone who hates us to the core. But before we put him into action, we will need to strengthen ourselves before entering enemy territory.&quot; Kyle began to piece the plan together once more, the vipers listening attentively to him. With his recent victory over the union, his actions and plans were no longer in doubt no matter how vicious or outrageous they were.</p><p>&quot;Sasha, Damian, Niko, Culo, and Monica will undergo a one-month training with me in the Culdao Peaks. It is clear that Harrison's men possess technology and skill far beyond our current capabilities. While I am confident we can deal with the threats, it is better to be safe than sorry.&quot; Kyle explained. &quot;On top of the vipers training, we will have the rest begin to prepare and stock up for our 'excursion'. This will occur in the following steps.&quot;</p><p>Kyle had Keith roll out a simple map of the surrounding regions, Versia, and the other counties of the Yual Dominion labeled clearly for all to see. &quot;It is obvious that there exist smuggling routes between Versia and Raktor that both the Ilysian Punks and Gunther had been using to both deliver and obtain supplies. We must find the specifics of these routes as soon as possible. My current estimation is the ships along the central river running through the Central Sector, as well as potentially a few tunnels that bypass the check along the walls.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Once we've uncovered their paths, we will send our forward team as soon as they are ready. They will collect local information and provide us with regular updates, which we will then tailor our actions accordingly.&quot; Kyle continued. &quot;While the forward team is collecting information, we will continue to ramp up training in the Culdao Peaks, improving our forces and equipment to be even better than that of the military. This is to ensure our chances of survival against any sudden backlash or betrayals from the nobles, Ardent Cretins or even Count Leon himself.&quot;</p><p>While the chances of Count Leon suddenly turning on them seemed low, none of the vipers thought it was wrong to be overprepared. A standing force of well-prepared fighters would always be a benefit to future conflicts or negotiations in anyway.</p><p>&quot;The moment we know exactly what is happening in Versia, I personally will head over to oversee operations myself, while Damian and Keith will remain in charge of operations in Raktor. A doppelganger trained by Keith will help maintain the facade that I am still around in Raktor, masking our movements.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, do you really have to go over personally? I understand that the situation at large has been stabilized for now, but it seems a bit risky to do all of this.&quot; Damian asked.</p><p>&quot;I am by far our strongest fighter. With Harrison possessing technology far beyond our current means, it falls to me to ensure the stability of our international operations.&quot; Kyle gave a cover-up answer, but the truth of the matter was that he needed to figure out where all the Galactic-Era tech was coming from, him being the only one among them who truly knew what they represented, not to mention the potential existence of ruins there. Sasha and Culo would not be able to operate them, and he had a sinking suspicion that his system would be able to make use of the ruins, similar to how he activated the Oracle Chamber in the Culdao Peaks. &quot;Any questions before we begin?&quot;</p><p>Niko shot up his hand quicker than the others. &quot;If I beat you during the training phase, do I get to be the leader of the Seven Snakes?&quot;</p><p>A wave of chuckles spread among the vipers, Niko's brows furrowing. &quot;What?! I thought that was the custom in the gang! Wasn't that how Kyle got his original position from the previous gang leader?&quot;</p><p>Damian couldn't contain his laughter, wiping a tear from his eye. &quot;Well, sure. If you want to end up like him.&quot;</p><p>Kyle didn't respond himself, merely smiling before motioning to the next viper who had a question. &quot;Keith, please, ask away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, while I understand that Harrison has been jeopardizing our operations here, it does not warrant such a plan to deal with him. We could simply enact certain countermeasures to prevent his poaching or attempts at stealing technology from us, like boosting security and so on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you think the plan is dangerous?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very much so, sir. The full force of the Seven Snakes will not be able to follow you over lest we raise suspicions - your only support would be Sasha, Culo and whatever men they can cobble together. You'll be entering the mouth of the lion, both figuratively and literally.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I won't be entering unprepared, if the information gathering goes to plan. And I will be able to handle any attack that comes my way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But sir, I don't understand. We could simply sit back and improve our businesses. Why must we specifically target Harrison?&quot;</p><p>Kyle sighed, rubbing his temples. He knew Keith had always been averse to fighting in general, but not to this extent. &quot;It seems that some things have not been made clear despite all of you having been under my wing for this long. I have but one purpose when it comes to dealing with someone who tried to steal and kill everything I had under my very nose for their own profit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And when it comes to such a man like Harrison,&quot; Kyle stared at the flyer on the table in front of them, the Versian conglomerate leader's grinning confident face taunting him. &quot;The purpose is as clear as daylight: to make everything that is his, mine. And if I can't have it, no one else can.&quot;</p><p>@@@</p><p>Culo fidgeted with his fingers as he glanced between the various other passengers in the wagon, wondering why was he even lumped in with them while the wagon bounced erratically on the unpaved roads of the Culdao Peaks. He squeezed past the two passengers flanking him on both sides, their burly arms nearly squashing him in as he tried to raise his hand, waving at the rearview mirror in the driver's cabin. &quot;Uhm, sir...? Mr. Kyle, I believe there has been a mistake of sorts...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mistake?&quot; Kyle turned back with a confused expression.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I've seem to have boarded the wrong wagon. I'm not a viper.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed you are not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But there are only vipers here. If this is some sort of uh… vacation retreat, I might have accidentally taken up a slot. Perhaps we should turn around and-&quot; Culo's words were slapped out of his chest when a large palm smacked him hard on the back.</p><p>&quot;Quit jabbering and keep quiet. You're in the right place.&quot; Monica groaned, trying to catch some shuteye.</p><p>Culo instantly shrank back into his own original position, his mind wandering about all the reasons why he had been hauled here. &quot;Mr. Kyle, if I've done something wrong, I sincerely apologize wholeheartedly, and will do anything to make it right - just please don't hurt me.&quot;</p><p>Kyle chuckled. &quot;Glad to hear it. I will hold you to that.&quot;</p><p>The wagon soon reached their destination - the first goblin den, where Feldon, Merissa and Gulak were already out, preparing to receive them. Feldon stood front and center, a wide beaming smile plastered on his face as he bowed nearly ninety degrees the moment Kyle exited the wagon. &quot;Welcome, Boss! It is our great pleasure to have you-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cut the bullshit, bring us to the training caves. We're on a tight deadline.&quot; Kyle's dismissal and the grim faces of the vipers were more than enough to put a stop to Feldon's idea of a warm reception, the group simply walking past them without worrying about appearances or decorum - not that the Seven Snakes used to anyway.</p><p>Culo nervously tagged along, only to suddenly come face to face with Gulak, a scream nearly leaving his throat as he had never met a goblin before. He shivered as Gulak's nose drew closer to him, the warts and greenish pus seeping out of them more vivid then ever.</p><p>&quot;You... you're weak. They must have delivered you for maggot pit!&quot; Gulak concluded, his laughter an eerie gurgle to himself before Sasha stepped in, grabbing Gulak by the nape of his neck and hauling him to the side. Culo's face was pale as ever, frightened beyond his wits, forcing Sasha to haul him in while he screamed at the top of his lungs. &quot;I DONT WANT TO BE A MAGGOT!&quot;</p><p>Sasha had to smack Culo's face a few times before he finally stop screaming and swapped to whimpering instead, earning only disdain from Sasha's clearly irked expression. [Sir, I really don't think he'll amount to much.] Sasha spoke through her telepathic engraving to Kyle.</p><p>&quot;Just like how you revealed your true strength through a challenge, so shall he.&quot; Kyle assured. &quot;The rest of you, take a break while I run Culo through the basics.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wh-what basics are there to being a maggot?!&quot; Culo exclaimed, only to earn another smack from Sasha.</p><p>&quot;If you don't shut up right now, I will make sure you get thrown into the maggot pit.&quot; Niko threatened, tired of all the whining. That got Culo to finally shut up for good, meekly leaving the other vipers behind as he followed Kyle deeper and deeper into the training caves, unsure of what was happening while Sasha brought up the rear. The dense dark stone walls made him feel more claustrophobic than ever before, even more so than the winding streets of Raktor. The hazy memories of open blue skies and expansive farms near his village felt further than ever before.</p><p>Now, he had to carefully watch each step he took over loose rocks and random ditches, the sounds of dripping water dominating the environment as he blindly followed Kyle further in. The ambient light of the glowing arcite embedded through the cavernous system served as the main source of light, only to be superseded by intermittent arctech lanterns that made it hard for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.</p><p>&quot;We're here.&quot; Kyle came to a sudden stop right outside a bolted wooden door, bloody handprints staining its dark moldy surface. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ready...? Ready for what?&quot; Culo glanced around frantically as Kyle himself rummaged around a nearby chest, picking up a rusty knife.</p><p>&quot;Ready to become a better man.&quot; Kyle tossed the rusty knife to it, Culo fumbling with his hands as he barely managed to catch it.</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Culo could only stare in horror as the door was opened, revealing a dark circular chamber with nothing to show for it, save for the scraps of decaying flesh and strips of broken leather armor scattered around the floor, the obvious signs of a fearsome battle.</p><p>He felt a kick shove him into the door, with Sasha entering after him as the door slammed shut behind them. An eerie silence rumbled in his eardrums while he slowly took in the surroundings, trying to spot anything of note. With nothing to go on, he turned around, hoping that Sasha had an answer. Instead, he found nothing, Sasha having seemingly disappeared into thin air.</p><p>A sudden ungodly shriek echoed from the other side of the chamber, causing Culo to yelp in horror. &quot;What was that? Hello? Ms. Sasha? Mr. Kyle? Anyone!?&quot;</p><p>His ears perked up at the response, before sharply realizing it wasn't anything human. All I could hear was the furious beat of something rushing towards him from seemingly all angles, his head swiveling quickly to try and peer through the dim lighting afforded by the chamber's sole lantern.</p><p><em>Fuck this, I'm not dying here like this!</em> Culo half-regretted following Kyle willingly into the wagon, but there was no time to lament about past issues. He gripped the hilt of the rusty knife tightly, ignoring the rough grooves that bit into his already calloused hand, knowing that the knife was all that stood between him and whatever monster was on the other side.</p><p>The scampering sounds of palms and feet slapping against the cold hard rocks around the chambers echoed incessantly, Culo priming himself for an attack from any direction. <em>It's circling me, looking for an opening. As soon as it leaps, I'll-</em></p><p>A claw lunged out and grabbed his arm from the side, the long rotting nails digging deep into his flesh. Culo shrieked in pain, his survival instincts kicking in as he swung the rusty knife down, the claws retracting immediately.</p><p>His eyes finally landed on the monster that was hunting him as he clutched his now bleeding arm - though calling it a monster was hardly the right word. &quot;What the fuck are you?!&quot;</p><p>The 'monster' was a heavily injured feral human, his posture animalistic as he glared at Culo with a clear frenzy, a level of aggression Culo was instinctively certain that he wouldn't be able to talk his way out of it. One of the feral human's arms was already clearly mangled from a past fight, leaving it dangling and lifeless, barely attached to its socket as he approached Culo, baring his teeth.</p><p>Another swipe from the feral human's good arm had Culo backpedaling frantically, who used the knife in a bid to scare him off. &quot;You try that one more time and I will -&quot;</p><p>The same ungodly shriek erupted from the feral human's broken jaw, nearly stunning Culo while the feral human charged head-on, rushing right at Culo.</p><p>Culo didn't waste his breath on talking any longer, gripping the knife as hard as he could when the body of the feral human slammed into him, the two of them tumbling onto the ground in a fierce struggle. A howl echoed as the knife found its mark, lodging its rusty blade deep into the chest of the feral human.</p><p>Culo ignored the dripping saliva from the feral human's canine-like teeth, twisting the knife and attempting to slice as hard as he could towards the side, using one hand to block the infected claw trying to gouge his eyes out. The feral human clung to him like a parasite, unwilling to let go until Culo finally found an opportunity to hit the feral human on the head, though to little effect.</p><p>Despite the knife cutting deep, the feral human still struggled with a primal fury, forcing Culo to resort to other options. Instead of trying to twist the knife any longer, he used his free hand and drove a fist straight into the broken jaw of the feral human.</p><p>The already broken jawbone splintered even more, the force shoving the fragments deeper into the face as the feral human recoiled in pain. Culo didn't let go of the chance, immediately gaining the upper hand and pouncing on the reeling feral human. With a vicious grip, he pulled out the knife with his other hand drove it straight through the head of the feral human.</p><p>The feral human's body twitched a little as it struggled to come to terms with its own death, before finally collapsing onto the ground, lifeless, leaving Culo panting hard, his lungs heaving from the frantic battle.</p><p>Finally, the pain that he had ignored on his injured arm began to overwhelm him, Culo noticing that he had lost blood through the gaping wounds, some parts starting to turn yellow from the infected claws. He clasped the wound in an attempt to stem the bleeding, stumbling away from the dead feral human and slumping against the wall.</p><p><em>Am I going to die here...? Brother...</em> Culo closed his eyes for a bit, trying to process what had just happened when a new presence suddenly emerged in front of him.</p><p>His instincts kicked in, using the same trusted rusty knife to stab forward without hesitation. The knife was easily deflected before his attacking arm was grappled expertly.</p><p>Before he could react,. the new attacker dumped the contents of a small yellow potion flask on the open wounds of Culo's arm, healing it quickly.</p><p>&quot;Huh...? Ms. Sasha...?&quot;</p><p>The door swung open, revealing a satisfied Kyle. &quot;Well done, Culo. I knew you could do it.&quot;</p><p>Culo was slightly stunned before anger began to well up from within, locking onto Kyle as the source of all of this. &quot;Are you fucking crazy?! Did you just throw me in here to die?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you did not fight back, then yes. But I was confident you had the will to see it through.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What...? What the fuck are you even trying to do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To make you a better fighter.&quot; Kyle inspected the dead feral human, surprised at the tenacity it had displayed so far despite it being nearly a year since he had experimented on them. He wondered if the failure rate of the tattoo knife was due to his original lack of experience with the arrangement and procedure of engraving arcia tattoos. With his new learnings, Kyle was confident he could impart a higher success rate to other people, though he would still need willing subjects to test this on. Or unwilling.</p><p>&quot;Why do I need to fight? I'm a union leader, not a Seven Snakes fighter!&quot; Culo retorted.</p><p>&quot;There will always be an occasion to fight. I need you to be able to stand on your own two feet - you'll be going to Versia with Sasha, and she will not be there to save your life all the time. There will be times where you will need to face overwhelming odds on your own.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Back to Versia...? Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That, I cannot say. But if you want to see your brother and village again, it would be advisable to complete this training without whining too much.&quot; Kyle got up and began to leave the chamber. &quot;Sasha, try to make sure he comes out in at least three pieces. I'll see you for dinner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;... complete this training? three pieces?! Wait, wait, wait! I've already cleared the training! I killed the man!&quot; Culo tried to find a way out, only to earn a chuckle from Kyle as Sasha activated a notch in the chambers' walls, opening a secret door from which two feral humans emerged, snarling and already locking onto Culo.</p><p>&quot;Cleared? You haven't even started.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 96 - Accelerated Training</strong></p><p>&quot;How long you think the scrawny kid will survive? I bet he caps out at two.&quot; Niko yawned as he stretched his limbs, lazing on a sofa in a waiting room, attended to by goblin servers who offered the three vipers sitting opposite each other refreshments and food.</p><p>&quot;Nah that kid got a fire in him. You've seen him during the strikes. He knows what it takes.&quot; Damian munched on a raw radish, crunching through the white juicy flesh which spluttered a few droplets across the room, earning the ire of Monica.</p><p>&quot;You really like that shit? It's fucking tasteless!&quot; Monica wiped off a splatter with a disgusted face.</p><p>&quot;Don't know about you, but I learnt from a young age you eat whatever edible dish comes your way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, I get that. But we're loaded now, we could eat at a fancy restaurant day in day out. Why eat... that?&quot;</p><p>Damian pondered a moment, before taking a second bite. &quot;Don't know. Guess I'm still stingy. Some things never change even if the world changes. Also, there is a slight spice to the radish, surprisingly refreshing. You should try it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No way. I heard that the spice is actually the radish's attempt at poisoning its would-be predators. That's why you dont see any Tusken Rabbits swarming the terrace farms. Also, sometimes these insane goblins put maggots in their Sahusa Stew&quot;</p><p>&quot;One animal's poison is another human's food.&quot;</p><p>&quot;HEY! Are you two even listening?&quot; Niko interjected the inane conversation, furious at being ignored.</p><p>&quot;Listening to what? Why do you care so much about Culo? Worry about yourself first.&quot; Monica sighed, rubbing her temples.</p><p>&quot;Worry about myself...? I can handle this training - it'll be easy as pie.&quot; Niko scoffed, leaning back into the sofa leisurely with a confident aura. &quot;By the end of this month, I should be able to challenge Kyle for the position of gang leader.&quot;</p><p>Damian and Monica exchanged a glance, before bursting out into laughter, chunks of radish spluttering out of Damian's mouth in a violent fashion, frightening the goblin servers who scampered to clean up the mess.</p><p>&quot;You? HAHA! You're fucking out of your mind!&quot; Monica couldn't control her laughter, slapping the holster of her chair repeatedly.</p><p>&quot;Wh-what?!&quot; Niko shot an aggravated look at the other two vipers still rolling in their seats, laughing at his expense. &quot;I ain't wrong, I know there's a tradition to duel for the gang leader's position!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think we're laughing about that?!&quot; Monica jeered. &quot;We're laughing about you thinking you could even come close to beating Kyle! Maybe consider whether you can even beat another viper first!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I sure as hell can beat you, you mocking bitch! I'm your senior, I joined the gang before you! Don't think I'm weak just because I'm younger than you, it only means I got more potential!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We both became vipers at the same time. Don't flatter yourself, you couldn't hold a candle to me in a duel. Out of the five who came here, you might be the second weakest. Even I think Culo might overtake you with time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Niko shot straight up of his sofa. &quot;I can handle you in a duel anytime, bitch. If we weren't in the same gang, I would have pummeled your face when you were captured by Damian!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yea? Try me now.&quot; Monica held a self-satisfied grin.</p><p>Damian was still laughing about Niko thinking he could beat Kyle, only to realize that Niko and Monica was being serious about it. &quot;Hold on, dont start a fight here. If you wanna fight, do it in the training caves or -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck no, I'm going to beat up this bitch in front of everyone. Fight me in the main chamber, or maybe Monica is too scared to do it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like fucking hell I'll take shit from you.&quot;</p><p>The two of them stormed out of the waiting room, entering the spacious central chamber of Gulak's goblin den, the walls and ceiling slowly being expanded over the months to accomodate more and more personnel. Decorations aimed at appeasing the local goblin slave population has been erected across the originally vacant desolate chamber, now filled with bouts of glowing mushrooms and dazzling vines that spruced up the environment.</p><p>Goblins and human employees alike mingled and relaxed at the various benches and food stalls, enjoying a mix of imported food and drinks delivered through the express tunnel that ran through the den, the vibrations dampened by a large statue of King Sahusa dominating the center of the chamber, reminding the goblins of their allegiance to the kingdom and serving as a mask for the real power behind the kingdom: Kyle.</p><p>Gulak's tribesman now acted as overseers and adminstrators, no longer relegated to the lowly manual labours that other subjugated tribes were forced to do now, creating a clear hierarchy with the Seven Snakes at the very top. With a wide variety of delicacies from both Raktor and the Culdao Peaks, along with modern infrastructure like public bathhouses, centralized cooling and motorized transportation through the longer sections of the den, it was starting to developed into an advanced underground town in its own right.</p><p>Yet the usual routine of the goblins and human employees were starkly broken by the appearance of Niko and Monica, both of whom marched right into the chamber and began to face off against each other, hardly caring for the safety of others around. Some of the goblin warriors who recognized Monica immediately grabbed their Sahusa stews and rushed to a much further location, away from the imminent destruction that was about to unfold, while other unaware bystanders began to form a ring around the two vipers unknowingly.</p><p>&quot;HEY, HEY, HEY! NO FIGHTING IN THE CHAMBER! IF YOU WANNA FIGHT , GO TO-&quot; Feldon shoved his way through the ring of goblins that had already formed fast, finally squeezing through only to be faced with a violent glare by Monica and Niko. He yelped before scrambling back away through the ring, not wanting to mess with an angry viper.</p><p>&quot;Where the fuck is your weapon?&quot; Niko motioned with his chin, while he brandished a default sword and round shield, requisitioned from a unwilling goblin warrior nearby.</p><p>&quot;Right here.&quot; Monica grinned as she sported brass knuckledusters, her arms in a boxing posture. &quot;This should be good enough to pummel you down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We'll see about that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright, alright. Duel stops when I say so. Fight to kill, but no finishing blows. We got loads of healing potions anyway.&quot; Damian crossing his arms, overseeing the battle as an arbiter. &quot;Ready?&quot;</p><p>Niko nodded, clutching the leather straps of the default round shield in his left arm, his right hand's sword positioned high, ready to swing and chop in any direction. His eyes locked onto the burly figure of Monica, who still stood still, arms raised and locked.</p><p>&quot;GO!&quot;</p><p>Niko launched forward, his right foot driving into the gravel, preparing to close the gap in two strides as his right arm tensed up, ready to deliver a downward swing. But before he could follow up with another step of his left foot, Monica had already taken three strides, her body twisting to the right of Niko while her right fist shot forward like a bullet, forcing Niko to hurriedly block the incoming strike with his shield, his footing messed up.</p><p>The force of the punch cracked the shield slightly as Niko was knocked backwards, his two feet drawing lines in the ground. Niko tried to recover his posture, yet Monica stuck to him like glue, immediately following up with two more straights and a hook, Niko blocking each strike with the skin of his teeth.</p><p>Soon, the shield began to crumble apart, the edges flaking from the reverberation of Monica's heavy punches. <em>Since when was she this strong?!</em> Niko had never really seen Monica fight before, but he was still determined to win, quickly jabbing forward with his sword to earn some space.</p><p>Monica swivelled her body, avoiding the incoming stab before resting her entire weight on her left foot, her right leg kicking out towards the exposed Niko, who could not retract his sword arm in time. The shin of Monica's right leg drove deep into the guts of Niko, his mouth gagging with saliva choking outwards as he was lifted off the ground temporarily by the sheer impulse.</p><p>With no time to react, Niko ate a fearsome left hook into his cheek, the knuckledusters smacking and crushing his cheekbone while he was sent toppling to the ground in a bloody mess. The audience members cheered, already a few goblins clutching their heads in despair as impromtu bookies jumped on the chance to run bets on the duel as quick as they could.</p><p>&quot;STOP!&quot; Damian roared, immediately stepping inbetween Monica and Niko, preventing Monica from following up. He turned to help Niko up, only for his helping hand to be smacked away, Niko himself popping a health potion flask and chugging it, his injuries healing up quickly.</p><p>&quot;You got guts, kid. But you certainly don't have the skill.&quot; A grinning Monica taunted, only making Niko far more irritated.</p><p>&quot;I was using the wrong weapons!&quot; Niko grunted as he wiped off a blood stain on his previously injured cheek. &quot;I wasn't used to the sword and shield!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yea? Go ahead and pick any weapon, I'll still beat you up.&quot; Monica motioned with her hand, inviting a second bout.</p><p>Niko tossed the sword and shield away onto the ground, before turning to a goblin warrior nearby and grabbing its spear, twirling it in his hands effortlessly before assuming a fighting posture, his palms gripping the rough surface of shaft tightly, the spearhead aimed low.</p><p>Damian was slightly impressed, knowing Niko chose the spear in order to create some distance between him and Monica's fist style. &quot;Ready?&quot; He shot a glance at Monica, who nodded back in response, content to use the same old knuckledusters agian.</p><p>&quot;GO!&quot;</p><p>This time, Niko pushed his legs to the limit, driving forward faster and trying to match Monica's speed. While he was still slower on the uptake, he managed to close the gap with ample preparation, the sharp tip of the spear already swinging at Monica's neck as she tried the same attack pattern on Niko.</p><p>The tip whizzed past as Monica recoiled, forced onto the backfoot with each step as Niko sent forward a quick strike and jab, mixing in wide arcing sweeps as well to keep Monica on her toes. The length of the spear prevented Monica from getting in close and delivering her punches, the threat of the spear too overwhelming.</p><p>As Niko performed a wide swing again, Monica took the opening while Niko was still retracting the spear, closing the gap as fast as she could only for her face to be met with the rear-end of the spear's shaft aimed right at her eyes. She swerved her head, narrowly dodging the blunt attack before crouching low and giving a fierce uppercut.</p><p>Yet Niko had a grin on his face, easily avoiding the predictable uppercut and instead reverse gripping the spear, stabbing the spear towards the crouching Monica.</p><p>She rolled fast onto the ground, creating distance and recovering into a fighting posture, a smile on her face. &quot;Learning, are we?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like I said, give me a month.&quot; Niko grinned, charging forward with more confidence now, Monica weaving through the strikes as the two vipers duel began to shift closer and closer to the audience, most of them now scrambling away to avoid getting hit. The pace of the battle was accelerating with time, moving ever quicker, both fighters' steps increasing in rhythm as they parried and fought across the chamber.</p><p>Unaware food stall customers were taken aback as the duel near them, some shouting and screaming at the two vipers to stop to no avail. Damian himself was still eating the same radish, hardly concerned with the chaos the duel was causing in the chamber.</p><p>&quot;How long are you going to dodge!&quot; Niko spat through gritted teeth, the muscles in his arms burning from the exhaustion of continuous stabs, his speed and combo beginning to slow down heavily.</p><p>&quot;Dodge? I'm just letting you have your fun.&quot; Monica smirked, before she suddenly used her two hands to grab the spear itself, before tugging hard on it. The tired Niko was caught off-guard by the sudden change in attack, his body toppling over as he still clung onto the spear, being dragged forward.</p><p>He frantically released it, only to see Monica's knee speeding towards his face, his nose being crushed in as he tumbled and crashing into a stew stall, sending radishes, maggots and fruits scattering across the floor which was unceremoniously picked up by the opportunistic audience members around.</p><p>Monica snapped the spear on her knee easily, tossing the two halves apart before rushing up to Niko who now had no weapon. Or so she had thought, as a large black circular metal bowl swung towards her, an impromtu metal wok used as a weapon by the undeterred Niko. Sizzling oil and squirming maggots spluttered across the both of them, Niko unrelenting as he charged forward, unwilling to give up the fight as he landed a direct blow on Monica's shoulder, smacking her hard.</p><p>The metal wok knocked her off-balance, but her legs kicked out instantly, her foot nailing Niko in the chest once more and sending him crashing into the already half-broken food stall, the goblin owner tearing what remained of his beard out in a rage. &lt; My maggots! &gt;</p><p>&quot;STOP! Monica wins again.&quot; Damian declared once more as he intervened. This time, Niko was far too exhausted from the longer duel to even raise an arm to feed himself a potion, reluctantly allowing Damian to pour a health and stamina potion into his mouth. His injuries still healed quickly, but the effect was reduced from the repetitive usage in such a short amount of time.</p><p>&quot;Good fight.&quot; Monica herself rubbed a bruised shoulder, flexing her arms a little to loosen it up before offering a hand to Niko. &quot;If only you trained harder instead of wasting your time hitting up girls and drinking all day, maybe you would have beaten Kyle by now.&quot;</p><p>Niko didn't reply, but he begrudgingly accepted Monica's hand, hoisting himself up with her help, but the two of them soon found Damian chuckling behind them. &quot;Why, what's so funny?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No... it's nothing. It's just that you two are really thinking too lightly of Kyle. Neither of you have trained with him yet, so you probably don't comprehend just how much better he is than all of us. Hell, I don't even think the two of you together could beat me, much less him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Monica took offense. &quot;I don't need Niko to beat you too! You're not that strong without your shield.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, sure, keep telling yourself that.&quot; Damian chortled, mocking Monica with a dismissive tone.</p><p>Monica gritted her teeth, before slapping Niko violently on the back. &quot;Come on, punk, let's teach this dumbass a lesson!&quot;</p><p>Niko stretched his limbs, his face grinning with anticipation. &quot;If we beat you, we get to be underboss, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure. If any of you can take me down, that is.&quot; Damian accepted the offer. Instead of using his custom-made tower shield. Damian took a default tower shield onto his left arm, testing the range of motion that was available to him. &quot;I'll use this. You two can use whatever you want.&quot;</p><p>Niko decided to take a spear once more, while Monica still kept her knuckledusters, raring to punch apart Damian's shield. &quot;No tattoos, else that's cheating!&quot; Monica warned.</p><p>&quot;Of course. And no excuses - I see both your fatigue and injuries have already healed up.&quot; Damian nodded, before glancing over towards the audience who had now grown into the hundreds, some clambering to the top of stalls to get a better view. &quot;FELDON! Stop hustling bets and come oversee the duel.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shit.... I mean, yes sir!&quot; Feldon saluted, stuffing the rakels he earned into his coat before acting prim and proper like a arena official. &quot;Ready? GO!&quot;</p><p>Monica rushed ahead faster than Niko, charging right at the stationary Damian. She threw her right fist straight at the tower shield, expecting it to crack as it did for Niko, but instead she could only watch as the shield was shifted slightly outwards, her punch missing as it went past it towards Damian's body, Damian's reaction time far quicker.</p><p>In one fell swoop, Damian grabbed Monica's extended right arm and slammed it against the edge of the tower shield in a crushing move, almost breaking the arm off as Monica roared in pain. But Damian did not let go just yet, instead using his elbow to send Monica backwards, her body crashing into the lunging Niko who was caught off-guard.</p><p>Niko grunted as he staggered backwards, hoisting the full weight of Monica before pushing her aside. &quot;Why the fuck are you so heavy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why the fuck are you not helping!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're literally in my way! You should've let me attack first with my spear!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't need your stupid ass!&quot;</p><p>Before the two could bicker any longer, Damian was already rushing at them with his tower shield front and center, slamming into the unprepared Niko and toppling him again. Monica tried to use her remaining good arm to grapple Damian's exposed body, lunging for his waist in an attempt to pin him to the ground. Yet even her strong arm was easily shrugged off, Damian using his free hand to punch Monica right in the face.</p><p>In just a minute, Damian stood towering over the two defeated vipers, Niko still struggling to get up while Monica was sprawled on the floor, suffering a heavy concussion. Feldon stared in shock at the disparity of power, before noticing Damian glaring at him. &quot;Right, right - STOP! The duel is over, Damian wins!&quot;</p><p>A few gambling goblins tossed their stew onto the ground in rage, some cursing Feldon out. &lt; Why did I even bet on that dumbass Niko? I shouldn't have been lured by the high odds offered by that stinking human! &gt;</p><p>Damian helped the two of them up, the potions used on their injuries, though this time Niko wasn't able to heal as much, still suffering from the slam from Damian. &quot;Are we done comparing? If you can't even last more than a minute against me, you won't last against Kyle.&quot; Damian chided them as he checked their injuries. &quot;You'll need more than this month of training to even come close to him.&quot;</p><p>The three vipers returned back to the waiting room, Niko weary from being defeated multiple times in a row, Monica depressed for having been shut up by the underboss, while Damian still munched on yet another radish, his obsession with it seemingly endless.</p><p>Soon, Kyle returned from the induction of Culo's training, before he noticed a few bruises on Niko and Monica with his keen eye, as well as their haggard breathing and empty potion flasks on the table in front of them. &quot;Was there an attack?&quot; He questioned Damian.</p><p>&quot;No, sir, no attack. We were simply uhh... training with each other ahead of schedule.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm...good to see enthusiasm for the training. This month is meant for us to close the power disparity we have between us and Harrison, so we will need every ounce of effort dedicated towards our improvement. To that effect I have created a new training routine.&quot;</p><p>Kyle began to explain the plan to them. &quot;From our experience against Harrison's hitmen, it's clear that not even Sasha can efficiently fight them one on one. Their technology and equipment far surpasses ours, them being able to use devices seemingly scoured from the Galactic Era. Our improved rifles were unable to penetrate their enhanced armor as well, which means we must find other avenues of improving our strength. While I will attempt to procure similar equipment, it is no secret that our fighting capability is concentrated in me, Sasha and Damian disproportionately.&quot;</p><p>Niko would have taken offense at that slight, but he was no longer hot-headed as he was before, having been humbled by both Monica and Damian. However, a fire still burned in his heart, his mind already thinking of ways to overcome his peers. Kyle could see the raw determination in Niko's eyes, Kyle nodding approvingly.</p><p>&quot;As such, we will have two weeks of accelerated individual weapon training. I will dedicate an hour to instructing both Niko and Monica independently, to have them brought up to par, while Damian and Sasha will continue to duel one another. Following the individual trainings, Culo will join us and participate in group training. While we are members of the same gang and have effective squad strategies, we do not have efficient combat synergy when handling enemies that cannot be killed easily. Each of you have been acting independently thus far, but we also have to learn to fight with one another.&quot;</p><p>Monica held her head low in slight shame, knowing that if Kyle had seen the disastorous 2v1 duel between Damian and her with Niko, Kyle might have had them punished heavily for being so incompetent.</p><p>&quot;With this, by the end of this month, the military exercise would begin, and we would be prepared to begin our entry to Versia. Adrian and Keith have already located potential smugglers and information dealers who are well-versed in Versia. They will compile and catalogue information that we need to get the most benefit of our expansion there. If we can get our hands on what technology and finances Harrison has in control, we would be a step ahead of any other gang in Raktor. Any questions?&quot;</p><p>Niko and Monica shook their heads, ready to improve themselves and prove their worth. However, Damian raised his hand, wanting to ask a question. &quot;Sir, you mentioned you'll only be training Niko and Monica for an hour each day. Are you not joining us for the rest of the training?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. If neither of you can beat Sasha, there is close to no reason I should be in the training - it would only lead to a one-sided beating with no practical learnings gained. Instead, I have something far more important to focus on - improving our equipment.&quot; Kyle smiled, tapping his Oriental Bloom handgun. &quot;And once we are done, Harrison's men won't stand a chance against us.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 97 - Engineering Improvements</strong></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Arcia Exosuit Arm Prototype(Advanced)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>It's been a few months since the last time he had done any serious crafting - most of the time he had been still carefully studying and learning about arcia and engravings ever since his tests on the various arctech engravings.</p><p>And despite Harrison's attacks on the Seven Snakes, Kyle had obtained something far more important - the exosuit arm dropped by Harrison's hitman, an additional piece on top of the spine that he already possessed. With this, he was now a step closer to completing an exosuit of his own entirely, though he was confident he would not get it right the first time.</p><p>The intricacies of a Galactic Era exosuit was far too much for him to recall, him having relegated most of the technical information into a separate cranial implant which naturally did not follow him through his reincarnation.</p><p>However, with the addition of this exosuit arm designed utilizing arcia energy, he can now begin to inspect and merge the various separate concepts of arcia engravings into a single overarching theme and model.</p><p><em>Hopefully, this should also improve the tattoo engravings.</em> Kyle still had possession of the engraving knife from Gulak, allowing him to perhaps increase the success rate of tattooing, which was the main reason holding him back from engraving for the vipers. Their skills and motivation were currently too valuable to run the risk of an engraving that only had a 7% survival rate.</p><p>Now, in the Oracle's Chambers, he had Harrison's exosuit arm laid out, two bright spotlights shining on it. The arm was well defined, with clear signs of precision machinery that Kyle had yet to see in Raktor itself. This only made him respect Harrison as an enemy even more, knowing that there would be a technological gap to overcome.</p><p>Yet such a gap would be nothing in front of Kyle, or so he believed. As he began slowly pry apart the arm piece by piece, the intricacies of the design was far more than he had expected, presenting a higher level of arcia engineering that he had yet to fully understand himself.</p><p>Within the arm was close to five layers of arcia engravings etched onto a slivery flexible membrane, each acting like a continuation of the circuit below. The lines were not exactly dense like the picocircuits of Kyle's former life, but it was still a technological marvel today.</p><p>What was especially confounding to Kyle was how the layers were attached. There were multiple through holes and mounting points between the layers, allowing the 'symbols' of the arcia engraving to be connected with each other in a lengthy sequence that provided it with its active skill.</p><p>He carefully deconstructed the membrane, using a tweezer to piece apart the tightly woven layers before separating them out. &quot;Orisa, are you here?&quot;</p><p>[Yes, Administrator.] The A.I materialized into view, her default human figure saluting at Kyle.</p><p>&quot;Scan these layers and digitize them into an electrical schematic.&quot;</p><p>[Understood.]</p><p>A loading drone was repurposed from the seed storage, Orisa using its inbuilt camera to take a medium resolution picture of the layers. [Administrator, the pictures do not match any known format of electrical wiring. My functionality is incapable of automatically populating the components as well.]</p><p>Kyle had half-forgotten that the A.I was not fully completed, and only had information regarding chemicals and agriculture. &quot;Never mind, trace all of the lines out and display them on the lab holomonitors. I'll take it from there.&quot;</p><p>The nondescript etches found in the layers were highlighted in blue, allowing Kyle to manually begin placing the layers ontop of one another in a 3D hologram supported by the lab's surviving functionality.</p><p>He walked between the layers, tracing out lines between through holes and mounting points, making sure the layout of the digitized pictures were exactly as it was on the membrane, before finally changing the colors to represent different sequences.</p><p>Soon he noticed that while the System Message had told him about a single active skill, it was in fact the combination of multiple engraving sequences to achieve the effect.</p><p>He took apart the engravings one by one, isolating their sequences before grabbing a few additional metal plates, quickly using an etcher to do a copy of the isolated engraving.</p><p>As expected, the System informed him of the various engravings now carved into the sample plates, a total of five separate sequences that all contributed to the movement of the arm itself.</p><p><em>There's not just a defensive engraving or a resistance engraving, there is also a motion, weight and enhancer engravings...</em> Kyle copied this engravings into memory by continuously etching them repeatedly into other sample metal plates. His proficiency at etching was now higher than ever, allowing him to drill the movements and image into his head.</p><p>The biggest learning point was the way the engravings were connected. Some were connected in the middle while others were connected at the start or the end. Each symbol in the engraving has multiple 'connection' points, each point having a different meaning like a language in itself.</p><p>As far as Kyle could tell, the language was only two-dimensional at best, with the layers acting as a way to compress more into less. Furthermore, the entire combined sequence was repeated over six times along the length of the membrane. Kyle soon quickly realized the benefits of repeating the engravings. <em>If one section of the arm is damaged, the rest of it is still functional.</em></p><p>The membrane of the exosuit arm was not the only thing that was engraved - the rest of the metal arm was also engraved. Kyle soon figured out that the membrane and exosuit arm's engravings were all powered by the hitman's innate arcia energy. While it paled in comparison to Kyle's current arcia capacity, it was still leagues above Damian, Niko and Monica, not to mention the newbie Culo.</p><p>Kyle was planning to help them cover that weakness as well, but for now he was focused on seeing if he could replicate the exosuit arm himself.</p><p>Over the next five hours, Kyle worked tirelessly without distraction while Orisa watched without a word, her A.I avatar stationary as Kyle learnt, copied and memorized every engraving sequence on the exosuit arm.</p><p><em>Good, I'm finally ready to begin.</em> Kyle drafted up schematics, sending them over to the smaller factory in the Culdao Peaks and having them manufacture the different components of the arm, save for all but the membrane itself, which he was still unsure as to what was its material. &quot;Orisa, analysis the membrane's material.&quot;</p><p>[Confirmed. Non-degradable superpolymer structure detected - Kusal Corporation Fabric.]</p><p>&quot;Never heard of them before.&quot;</p><p>[I have records of only their name, but not their existence or history. Kusal Corporation Fabric can be used to upgrade modules here.]</p><p>&quot;Which modules?&quot; Kyle could only recall the Physical Transfer Module, in which Orisa would be able to take control of a physical humanoid body, a distinct feature of an A-Class A.I</p><p>[Digital Compaction Module. The module allows a reduced copy of the A.I to be integrated in a chip form into other Council-format compliant devices.]</p><p>Kyle nodded, knowing that fully developed exosuits required a companion A.I to help the pilot process information in the event there was a sensory overload. Yet he could not cannibalize the membrane right now, as he needed it as a reference before he could produce the exosuit arm. &quot;Can you analysis the structure of the Kusal Corporation Fabric?&quot;</p><p>[Affirmative. I will utilize the chemical analysis procedure used for seed and plant identification.]</p><p>&quot;Estimated time?&quot;</p><p>[Unknown. Complexity does not follow any known natural occurring substance.]</p><p>The information given to him by Orisa only made him sigh. <em>What a waste Harrison. You're sitting on a veritable gold mine and wasted it.</em> However he had to admit that the usage of the Kusal Corporation Fabric in places of bulky wires was ingenious. Many lower-tier exosuits, even in the Galactic Era were mostly utilizing flex cables to transfer power from a mounted battery pack. With such a single point of power failure, an exosuit that lack redundant systems could easily be taken out by simply destroying either the power source or the spine which distributes the current.</p><p>Instead, this membrane allowed for segregated usage, allowing for limited functionality even when partially damaged due to the spread of the repeated sequences that have contact points with the skin. Of course, there was still a single point of failure: the wearer's internal arcia energy.</p><p>Kyle took this information to heart, continuing to practice the engravings as much as possible while waiting for the manufactured parts to come in. It took nearly another eight hours for the parts to finally come in, Kyle arranging them in sequence using a draft assembly procedure.</p><p>&quot;Orisa, analyze assembly procedure and create holo-renderings of steps.&quot;</p><p>3D holograms appeared, crude images to show how each piece fit together. As Kyle held the first bolt in his hand, memories of his childhood training came rushing back. Memories of his forced routine, locked in a room until he could disassemble and reassemble a military exosuit from scratch. <em>Some things never change.</em></p><p>He got to work, inserting latching bolts, washers, springs, and o-rings all custom-made by the factory, assembling them tirelessly through countersunk threaded holes, the exosuit arm slowly coming together.</p><p>Within a short fifteen minutes he had the frame of the exosuit arm in place. He placed it on his own arm, trying to wear it before realizing he couldn't even squeeze his hand through the opening at the shoulder like a sleeve.</p><p><em>If I made it wider, it would be too loose. I need a tightening and loosening mechanism.</em> Kyle quickly disassembled the frame again, drawing up a new schematic and then requesting the factory to produce newer parts.</p><p>The process repeated like this, Kyle going through multiple tests of dimensional tolerances, stress tests and freedom of movement. <em>This part is continuously jabbing itself into my forearm, its uncomfortable. This frame is too rough, the sanding isn't enough. I can't bend my arm all the way either.</em></p><p>Before Kyle knew it, it was already morning when he finally had a workable frame mounted on his right arm. It was a close to perfect custom fit to his current arm size, with some slight room for further refinement. <em>Now for the engraving plates.</em></p><p>[Administrator, you were previously scheduled to instruct Niko individually for weapons training.]</p><p>&quot;Right, got it.&quot; Kyle kept the frame on, bringing it for the training back at Gulak's den, where Niko was already waiting in a training chamber with an assortment of various weapons arranged neatly on a rack for Niko to select from.</p><p>&quot;What the hell is that? You trying to become a factory?&quot; Niko exclaimed, squinting at the weird looking arm frame that was devoid of armor plates.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry too much about. Consider it a handicap for me for your sake.&quot; Kyle flexed the frame a little, noticing a slight difficulty in moving freely. <em>This should be good to test the current structure's performance in simulated combat.</em></p><p>&quot;Handicap..? So you won't take it off no matter what, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perfect... but what are we supposed to do again?&quot; Niko scratched his head in confusion. &quot;How am I supposed to know which weapon fits me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pick any weapon and try to kill me. You will pass this session if you can land three blows on my chest.&quot; Kyle held up his fingers.</p><p>Niko grinned, picking up a simple blunt club from the weapons rack, testing its weight on his palms. &quot;And if I don't?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then it will be a good one hour of training. If you survive.&quot; Kyle stood in the center of the chamber, facing Niko calmly. &quot;Begin anytime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You said it!&quot; Niko yelled with a smile as he flung the club with a jerk, the target being Kyle's chest. Even while the club was in mid-air, Niko was already gripping another weapon in the rack, intending to hurl a throwing javelin. <em>I'll hit him in the position he's about to dodge... LEFT!</em></p><p>The split second choice had the throwing javelin soaring through the air, aimed at a predicted location. Yet instead of dodging, Kyle simply used the prototype structural frame on his arm to smack the club down without moving a single inch, the throwing javelin impacting the ground next to him helplessly.</p><p>&quot;Hey, what the hell! Doesn't that count as a blow?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said <em>three blows on my chest</em>.&quot;</p><p>Niko gritted his teeth, grabbing a short goblin dagger as well as a few other knives on the rack, throwing them haphazardly at Kyle in a bid to hit the chest. Kyle simply yawned while most of the throwing weapons missed him. &quot;If you're going to continue fooling around, I will have no choice but to impress on you the importance of this training. Through force.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can't blame me, I'm testing weapons!&quot; Niko was unrepentant, having learnt how to fight through bare hands and grabbing anything that was within range during a pub brawl or an alley fight. He knew how to use a rifle effectively as both a ranged gun and a blunt staff, but he was far from an expert in it. As he reached for yet another throwing weapon on the rack, he heard a loud bang as Kyle lunged towards him in one leap, nearly closing the gap in an instant.</p><p>Battle instincts kicked as Niko gripped the nearest weapon in a desperate bid to protect himself, pulling the shaft of the weapon towards his own chest with both hands to intercept Kyle's incoming punch, the pressure feeling like impending death.</p><p>The punch slammed the shaft of Niko's weapon head-on, cracking it apart in two while Niko's body was knocked backwards, stumbling and tripping on his own heels as both him and the weapons rack were toppled by the impact. His head knocked hard against the ground, nearly disorientating him but his muscle memory for the multiple Seven Snakes fight kicked in, frantically recovering into a crouching fighting posture.</p><p>Another fast kick came in hard from the left, forcing Niko to raise half of his broken weapon, before finally realizing it was a rugged waraxe, or at least that was what it was before the shaft snapped off. Niko hurriedly twisted the stained edge of the waraxe towards Kyle's incoming shin, forcing Kyle to retract the leg and allowing Niko some breathing room to recover into his full standing height.</p><p>Without a word, Niko wielded the top half of the war axe in his left hand along with the remaining half of the shaft in his right hand, swinging downwards at Kyle's chest with the full intent to hurt with a grunt. Kyle swerved to the side, angling his body to dodge the incoming slash with ease, before ducking low to avoid a frontal stab by the cracked shaft in Niko's right.</p><p>Kyle observed Niko carefully as he dodged and weaved between Niko's various attempts to hit Kyle even once. It was clear that Niko definitely had the impetus and fighting strength to achieve the skills of an average warrior above the common folk, but without a weapon specialization it was hard to obtain an expert level. This observation created a conundrum for Kyle as well: training Niko in a specific weapon would reduce his apparent versatility between weapons, an critical trait to retain in times of war and battle. Being adaptive on the battlefield is a hard viewpoint to cultivate once Niko were to be a trained expert in any weapon.</p><p>Luckily, Kyle had ample experience in being adaptive himself, having been trained for decades in various weapons. He highly doubt he would be able to raise Niko to the same level as him within a month, but as long as he could instill the correct foundation in Niko, there would be room to grow. Kyle suspected that this trait alone would eventually make Niko the strongest and most versatile fighter among his men with the right attitude.</p><p>Niko swung feverishly, his face scrounged up in effort and strain as it became apparent that whatever bravado he had at the start of the training was clearly misplaced. He could not even land a single hit on Kyle, Kyle's footwork nearly impeccable. Kyle was continuously putting his body in a position that made it awkward for Niko to attack without repositioning his body and posture, especially if he did not want to be off balance.</p><p>Each step and each movement, Kyle would throw a fake punch or a fake kick, exposing the gaps in Niko's motions and balance. Niko took the hint, not requiring any words, his body automatically learning on the spot. As time went on, the openings were gradually reduced, though Niko was clearly starting to get tired with every successive attack, the swings slowing down tremendously as he drew short rapid breaths, his arms beginning to feel like lead.</p><p>With his reactions slowed, he could hardly react in time when Kyle charged forward abruptly, expertly throwing Niko on to the ground with a grapple. &quot;Drink up.&quot; Kyle tossed a stamina potion over to Niko, Niko chugging its contents greedily as he began to recover his strength.</p><p>&quot;Whew... is that the end of the training?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm? It's only been fifteen minutes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Niko's jaw dropped, his body having felt like he was fighting non-stop for an hour as he laid on the ground sprawled out.</p><p>Kyle tapped his chin as he took stock of the weapons that were now scattered on the ground next to the toppled weapons' rack, thinking of the next steps. Niko's proficiency with the war axe was amateur at best, showing no real understanding of the weapon itself. Clearly the style of training that Kyle had used himself was not effective enough for Niko to get a good grasp on how to use it.</p><p>Instead of wasting the next hour, Kyle decided to switch it up, picking up Niko's broken war axe and twirling it effortlessly in his hand. &quot;For the next ten minutes, you will dodge the war axe.&quot;</p><p>Niko's jaw couldn't drop anymore. &quot;That's even harder! Why the hell are we doing this?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You need to understand both defense and attack, different perspectives of the same weapon. By being put in the role of defender, you will come to understand and visualize how an attack would go, and increase your prediction rate as well. Moving forward, we will fight in bouts of ten minutes, with five minutes for rest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure...&quot; Niko pushed himself off the ground, stretching his limbs once more. &quot;But you won't hit me... right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have enough health potions if I am... unable to stop in time. Sometimes pain is the best lesson.&quot;</p><p>Niko frantically shook his head and hands. &quot;Wait wait wait, if we do it like this, I'm going to overdose on the potions!&quot;</p><p>Kyle pondered for a moment. &quot;Alright. I will stop just before the edge touches your skin. But for every 'hit', your pay will be docked 100 rakels.&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHA-&quot; Niko yelled only to have his words caught in his throat, his eyes bulging as he watched the edge of the very same war axe he used swing towards him with a devastating force, the blade aimed right at his neck. He had no time to react as the edge stopped short of his skin, his pores and hair tensing up while goosebumps and a shocking adrenaline pumped through his veins.</p><p>&quot;1.&quot; Kyle counted.</p><p>Niko didn't bother complaining anymore, immediately nodding and immediately began running away, circling the chamber. &quot;Running away is considered dodging!&quot; He shouted with a grin, slightly confident he would be faster with no weapons compared to Kyle holding the war axe.</p><p>As soon as he cleared a third of the chamber's circumference, he hear loud stomps behind that prompted him to turn his head around, a scream leaving his lips while he watched a frightening Kyle charge straight at him, easily closing the gap with each stride that was twice as fast as his running speed.</p><p>Niko dolphin-dived to the ground as the war axe whizzed past where his head used to be, quickly rolling to the side as soon as he landed, avoiding a powerful downward swing that cracked the chamber's floor. Niko quickly recovered and kept his eyes locked on Kyle, knowing running wouldn't save him in the long run. Unfortunately, staying to dodge also was a disaster Within the ten minutes, Niko found himself laying on the ground once again, panting his lungs out while his lungs heaved.</p><p>&quot;You would have been killed 40 times by now.&quot; Kyle surmised, passing the war axe to the sprawled out Niko.</p><p>&quot;Only because I don't have a rifle! Whats the use in training all of these melee weapons when we have guns?&quot; Niko lamented. &quot;If anyone charges at me with a spear I could just shoot them!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not in close quarters, not in tight spaces and certainly not in urban skirmishes. Don’t forget there's a city-wide restriction on guns. Furthermore, there will be times when a gun is unable to kill an enemy. It is then your expertise with a weapon will come in handy. Arctech weapons can be far more deadly than our rifles in the right situation.&quot;</p><p>The training session continued, the results being as expected. &quot;Your one hour is up.&quot; Kyle concluded. &quot;Tomorrow, you will use a different weapon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I was just starting to get used to a war axe. Were we not supposed to train a specific weapon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The point behind training different weapons for you is in order to develop an understanding of weapon combat overall. The fundamentals of strikes, slices, jabs and swings can have similarities between different types of weapon, no matter how unique their shapes are. In the first week we will work on that concept, and then we will choose a weapon to start focusing on in the second.&quot;</p><p>Kyle left Niko to his regular training routine of duels and limit testing against feral humans or other vipers, while he returned to his workshop in the Oracle Chambers. With about five hours to the next weapons training session with Monica and him still waiting for the iteration results from Orisa on the exosuit arm frame, he decided to work on something else, retrieving the tattoo knife and laying it out.</p><p>The only two people that had a tattoo engraving were Damian and Sasha. Manpower was scarce in the gang's early days so Kyle did not take unnecessary risks. Now, with his improved capabilities in etching and engraving, he felt that the success rate of the knife should increase tremendously.</p><p><em>Then again, must I use the knife specifically?</em> Kyle wondered what was special about the knife, and whether or not he could recreate it into something that was more stable, easier to use and replicate success.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Taboo Knife (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A goblin heirloom from the past, designed for tattooing enchantments onto the skin.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Age undetermined.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The ritual knife was engraved with enchantments and clearly not made for goblins alone, with Kyle considering how best to replicate its effects. While he could see the arctech sequences on the surface, it was still unclear whether or not it was layered with other enchantments beneath, something that was impossible to see without a scanner.</p><p><em>A scanner...</em> &quot;Orisa, are you able to scan the knife itself?&quot;</p><p>[Negative. I am able to provide a chemical analysis of the item, but not a nanometer-depth breakdown.]</p><p>Kyle sighed, thinking of another way to try and improve the knife's engraving success. It would be difficult to crack it apart without irreversibly damaging the rest of the engravings. However, all hope was not lost, for Gulak's Taboo Knife should not be the only one around.</p><p>Exiting the chamber, he found King Sahusa in the palace working hard on implementing a bureaucratic system to handle the allocation of new houses and jobs across the kingdom. The goblin kingdom was very much ran as a monarchy, where the King's rule was final. It was with this authority and newfound support from the Seven Snakes that King Sahusa decided to be a benevolent leader and improve the lives of his fellow goblins.</p><p>Kyle had no qualms with that - an improvement in infrastructure and amentities across the kingdom would slowly erode the hate and distrust that his human gang members and employees faced regularly overtime. In order to truly exploit a position of power within a society, it is best to have a good public image for longevity to continue utilizing the obedient population at large. If he didn't care about the long-term, Kyle would have had all goblins enter the deepest floors of the new mine and harvest all the Toxic Nodia possible without a single gas mask to reduce cost.</p><p>&quot;This knife, we have quite a few of them. In fact, I can introduce to one of my inhouse artisans who still knows how to make them. Perhaps you can get some further insights through them.&quot; King Sahusa recommended. &quot;Not many goblins dare to undergo the ritual, many having died through its violent process.&quot;</p><p>Following the lead, Kyle reached a sizable workshop nested in the very center of the valley, long-standing and enduring, still made out of the old clay and mortar design that rich goblins could afford back before Kyle 'uplifted' them. Regular plumes of black smoke churned out of crudely carved holes up the top of the workshop, the hot fumes drafting upwards while Kyle entered through a rugged wooden fence long decayed, the splinters breaking apart.</p><p>Inside was a lone goblin whos white beard betrayed its age, still carefully etching a palace spearhead, seemingly a contract issued by King Sahusa. The working space was slightly grimy and unkept, soot and dust covering every inch of the floor while the ambient crackle of wood breaking apart in the fireplace gave a surprisingly soothing, rustic feel.</p><p>&quot;I heard you know how to make this.&quot; Kyle began, unveiling the taboo knife while standing next to the old goblin artisan, who still was peering through an old monocle, his hand rocksteady as he carved into the palace spearhead.</p><p>&lt; I do. But I don't make them for humans. &gt; The old goblin mumbled.</p><p>&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;</p><p>&lt; The real king behind our false puppet. I know you. This is not the first time we have been exploited by humans. &gt;</p><p>&quot;And why do you not make them for humans?&quot;</p><p>The old goblin finally put down the etcher quietly onto the table, removing the monocle to stare at Kyle intently, scanning his face. &lt; Interesting. I was sure that you would have tried to kill or hurt me by now. You're different. &gt;</p><p>Kyle was slightly impressed at the clarity of the old goblin's mind given its apparent age. Despite the old goblin's aggressive stance, he had no intention of harming or hurting him, lest the good image of the Seven Snakes or King Sahusa was ruined, so he bore the disrespect quietly. &lt; Of course I am. &gt; Kyle spoke in the native goblin language, surprising the old goblin further.</p><p>&lt; Strange, strange indeed. &gt; The old goblin pondered for a moment, stroking his white bread. &lt; How do you know to speak our language? As far as I know, you only appeared months ago. &gt;</p><p>&lt; I had a good teacher. &gt; Kyle shrugged. &lt; You still haven't answered my question. &gt;</p><p>The old goblin rummaged about a crate nearby, picking up a flask and pouch in his wrinkled hands. &lt; Humans have a much lower survival rate with the knife than goblins. About close to double. You will need additional help to increase your chances, such as using specific materials like these. &gt; He handed them to Kyle, Kyle instantly recognizing them as Toxic Nodia in its liquid form, along with a pouch of Dzi Flower Sand.</p><p>&lt; I was thinking about improving the quality of the knife itself. It would be good if you could share the blueprints if any. &gt;</p><p>&lt; The design has hardly changed over the centuries since we first obtained it. &gt; The old goblin sighed. &lt; Every attempt I've made at improving the work handed down my family has only ended in failure. &gt;</p><p>&lt; Perhaps I can try. I'm something of an arctech engineer myself. &gt; Kyle offered.</p><p>The old goblin hesitated for a moment, weighing the pros and cons before finally accepting. He handed the engravings and etching guides that had been scribbled onto dried animal skin, a family heirloom that has been passed down through the generations. Kyle quickly scanned the engravings required, before proceeding to etch them one by one on a separate piece of metal, memorizing it through practice and adding it to his repertoire over the next four hours.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Title Obtained</strong>: Arcia Engraver (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A veritable walking dictionary to engravings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> +20 INT, +12 DEX, +30% chance at improving quality of final Arctech Equipment.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>&lt; You mentioned that specific material could help increase the success rate. How is it used? &gt; Kyle waved the Toxic Nodia flask at the old goblin.</p><p>&lt; When cutting the skin, you must sprinkle the Dzi Flower Sand over, which will increase the power of the engraving. The Toxic Nodia will react with the Dzi Flower sand to form smaller particulates that helps the body to better acclimatize to the new engraving before the person loses his mind. &gt; The old goblin explained.</p><p>&lt; How much of each do I use? &gt;</p><p>&lt; This... I cannot say. Every individual has a different tolerance level for the quantity of each. This can only be learnt through trial and error over a long time. It is suggested to only use it when engraving smaller elements. &gt;</p><p>With the newfound information, Kyle left the workshop, returning to the Oracle Chamber. Toxic Nodia was now easily harvestable from the mines, while Dzi Flower Sand could then theoretically be sifted from the sediments of the river flowing down the river, both of which were already being used in the production of addictive mindtwisters.</p><p>But with no clear idea on how much to use for each, it was far too dangerous to utilize the brand new procedure on Niko and Monica as vipers. However, Kyle was not bothered at all, knowing exactly how to fix this lack of knowledge. As he travelled back to Gulak's training caves for Monica's allocated session, he rang up the Seven Snakes in Raktor.</p><p>&quot;Keith? Send all prisoners who are unfit for further clinical trials to me. I have a new job for them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 98 - Weapon Lessons</strong></p><p>Monica can't remember the last time she's been pushed this hard. Not even the war with the Ilysian Punks or Gunther's union had her struggling this hard without a glimmer of hope of winning. At least when she fought against Damian and Sasha, she could at least see or visualize what she needed to do to close the gap, or understand what she was lacking in.</p><p>This? This was just a one-sided humifaction by Kyle, who hardly broke a sweat as he smoothly dodged each of Monica's punches without moving back too much. Monica gritted her teeth as she roared, through a few more punches, trying to get a clean hit on Kyle's body.</p><p>&quot;You're too slow with your punches. Far too much emphasis on strength and brawling. A good skill to have learnt from your years growing up in Raktor, but not enough to face off with the best.&quot; Kyle pointed out as the fight concluded, Monica exhausted beyond her limit and dropping to one knee</p><p>&quot;Well I don't have an tattoo or equipment backing me up unlike Damian and Sasha!&quot; Monica shoved the blame aside, trying to deliver one last desperate kick, hoping to catch Kyle off-guard.</p><p>Instead, she found the ceiling swirling around her vision as her leg was grabbed in one hand, Kyle tossing and twisting her onto the ground with an expert martial grip, her shoulder blades scrapping the rough stone floor of the vast training chamber.</p><p>&quot;They could beat you without using their engraving or equipment as well. I too have neither.&quot; Kyle shrugged.</p><p>Monica opened her mouth to retort, but decided better against it. She had heard of Kyle's 'transformation' from a weak member of the old Seven Snakes to an irrationally strong, violent and confident leader, which still made no sense to her.</p><p>&quot;I understand you are specialized in using your fists. Gloves or knuckledusters should work the best for your style, but with your current weaknesses its far too easy to overcome. In the new age, guns and artillery are the main things that will kill you in a battle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what, you want me to wear a shield like Damian? Fuck that, if I'm going into a fight, I'm going in to pummel their faces.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It simply means that your equipment has to cover for that weakness. Your biggest flaw was proven just now - you could hardly catch up with me. And by my estimation, no matter how much you train, someone with a more compact body will always be able to outpace you if you were on equal terms.&quot; Kyle explained, though it sounded more like he was talking to himself.</p><p>&quot;Are you calling me fat?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So you will need something that can slow down the person if you want to catch him...&quot;</p><p>Monica struggled to get up, her hands gripping her knee as she supported herself upwards. &quot;I don't care about that, what I want is that the moment I catch them, they are dead. That's all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm, but you also don't have enough brute strength through break through a defense.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then I'll keep punching and pushing until I do! I don't need one hit wonders, I just want to be sure to finish them off. Anyway, enough chatting. Again!&quot;</p><p>The one hour training session concluded the same way as Niko's did: utter devastation with Monica not being able to hit Kyle's chest at all despite having specialized in a weapon. Kyle had also alternated attack and defense spars, allowing Monica to better visualize and internalize learnings of how best to cover her weaknesses.</p><p>&quot;Tomorrow, I will use my handgun. Try your best to think on how to deal with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p><p>Kyle left the flabbergasted Monica behind in the training chamber, returning to the Oracle Chamber once more where the variations on the exosuit arm frame was finally completed, displayed to him in various holograms. Selecting the best variation with material cut out and reduction in overall envelope size, he finally had what he deemed was the final exosuit arm frame design. <em>Now, time for the engravings.</em></p><p>With no more Kusal Corporation Fabric to utilize, he decided to settle on using layering within the metal plate itself. However, the integrity of the metal would be lost if it had too many layers to begin with. Melding the different metal layers together would also result in warping and disfiguration of the engraving, which may result in unwanted effects. Kyle certainly wouldn't want his exosuit arm to suddenly burst out into insect eggs during combat.</p><p>He decided to utilize three engravings - a point defense engraving copied from the military breastplate, coupled with resistance and strength engravings as a first test run, seeing if the different skills could be combined into one single arm. Sending the designs of the various engravings off to the factory, he could only wait for the manufacturing to be complete, the lead time being three days.</p><p>Next up was the improvement of the taboo knife. As expected, the blueprints for the taboo knife had engravings within the knife itself, a total of three separate sequences as well. He already had practice copies of the design, the most interesting one of them all being the blood infusion engraving.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Blood Arcia Infusion Engraving (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Channel the force of nature through your veins</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Infuse</strong>: Blood that touches the engraving will have ambient arcia energy from the surroundings infused into the cells. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> A weaker physique will not be able to handle the change and potentially cause seizures, memory loss, and personality degradation.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Apart from the explanation of how the taboo knife actually worked, the rest of the side effects were already familiar to Kyle, having experimented on a few hundred humans already. What truly worried him was the usage of Toxic Nodia and Dzi Flower Sand in the process.</p><p>However, with the influx of prisoners from Raktor ready to be part of a greater cause, Kyle felt confident enough to begin experimenting on them, though carefully, setting up control tests and creating a rigorous testing procedure. <em>Best to select a simple engraving, one that is easier first.</em> Choosing the same force-increasing enchantment from Riker's pipe that he used on Sasha, he began to vary the quantities of Dzi Flower Sand and Toxic Nodia, arranging them in separate flasks while ordering the goblin slaves to restrain the prisoners down to tables.</p><p>There were only a hundred humans delivered, with about of third of them still suffering from Absolute Euria withdrawal. Without knowing if there would be any complications with the withdrawal symptoms, Kyle decided to work on the rest, some of whom were already disabled or maimed. <em>Too bad there is no anesthesia.</em></p><p>Segregating them into separate chambers, Kyle began to experiment, screams and shouts echoing through the chamber from those who still had the strength to attempt to fight back. The testing was brutal, lasting through the night as Kyle meticulously carved the skin with the sharp tip of the taboo knife like a surgeon, goblin slaves helping him to bring cloths that soaked up the residual blood. Arcite ore was placed nearby, acting as a replacement for the ambient arcia energy in the environment if Kyle needed it.</p><p>Over the first ten humans, already seven became feral, with three surprisingly surviving the process, those that had Dzi Flower Sand applied to the carving and Toxic Nodia subsequently poured over it. Kyle had to wear a gas mask to avoid the toxic fumes billowing out from the reaction, dark green swirls of rancid smoke spilling into the chamber. For the patient, a simple wet cloth was placed, which both muffled the painful shrieks and reduced the effects of the toxic fumes.</p><p>However, as he began to increase the dosage of the additional material, the eleventh human's body began to bloat significantly, as if it was getting pumped up like a balloon. The test subject's eyes widened in horror as he tried to speak, only for a sickening green liquid gushing out of his various orifices, leaking like a sinking ship before the skin drawn taut finally burst apart in a bloody mist stained with Toxic Nodia, partnering Kyle in a shower of flesh and ungodly fluids. The unnerving scene frightened the goblins, but Kyle was unfazed, merely moving onto the next subject as per planned. &quot;That was not good.&quot;</p><p>Finally, as he began to slowly tweak the quantities lower and lower, he found the procedure, managing to succeed on five test subjects in a row, a feat previously unachievable with just the taboo knife alone. <em>A 1 to 3 ratio , Dzi Flower Sand to Toxic Nodia.</em> Kyle had the procedure down on lock, though, save for the placement of the Dzi Flower Sand beads. This method also gave an interesting insight into how current arctech engravings can be improved, as the amalgamation between Toxic Nodia and Dzi Flower Sand seemed to be a natural enhancer to the efficiency of the sequence that it is placed in.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Title Obtained</strong>: Human Flesh Carver (Basic)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> +10 INT, +10 DEX, +25% chance at improving quality of the final carving.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Over the next three days, Kyle perfected his movements and procedure during the surgery, becoming akin to a meticulous surgeon with steady hands. Soon, the prisoners had achieved a near 75% success rate, though there were still some issues of rejection and uncontrollable descents into madness, but Kyle considered them a sacrifice that he was willing to make. However, as soon as he stepped across the threshold of having more than one engraving in the body, the same bloating issue occurred for all test subjects, the bodies violently refusing to accept the new engravings. Kyle needed to find someone who was compatible with the Dzi Flower Sand to see if a human body could hold more than one engraving, for he knew that he now had more than one skill thanks to the System.</p><p>The three days also saw Niko, Damian, and Monica improving by leaps and bounds. Niko had yet to choose any weapon, but the fundamentals were getting stronger and stronger by the day. Monica had finally began to fully visualize both sides of attack and defense, elevating her combat skills another notch. Damian himself had only grown far more resistant to incoming damage over time as well as improving his reaction speed to imminent attacks, even able to pre-emptively stop Sasha's falchion with his custom-made tower shield.</p><p>Sasha, on the other hand, felt like she was hitting a wall, unable to progress any further. The falchion that she had obtained from the Snow Song's shaman was indeed a boost to her own power and strength, but it did not really feel like it was a part of her. She was very much a flexible fighter like Niko, able to use any weapon effectively but not to a master level, unsure of whether she should specialize in the falchion. Not knowing how to move forward, she went to Kyle, noticing the clear improvements in the engravings and Kyle's conundrum on doing multiple engravings. [Sir, I volunteer.]</p><p>Kyle immediately shook his head, though his steady surgical hands hardly budge as he still carved away on a body. &quot;No. Out of the question. The procedure for getting a second engraving currently has a 100% death rate.&quot;</p><p>[I have an affinity with the Dzi Flower Sand.] Sasha reminded Kyle of how the original ceremonial bracelet presented to them had seeped into her skin. [I am the best candidate by far.]</p><p>Kyle pondered for a moment. He didn't consider any vipers irreplaceable, not even Sasha, though the setback in terms of time, effort, and resources put into training them was irreversible. He might have agreed back in the Galactic Era, as there was a large population of willing humans, but here, Sasha was unique and still had leads that he had yet to explore. &quot;Once I'm done with this body, you and I will carry it up to the Snow Song tribe and seek advice.&quot;</p><p>Lugging the unconscious patient in a conspicuous body bag, Kyle and Sasha made the same trek back up again, this time moving much faster thanks to their previous experience. Sasha dropped the body at the feet of the terrified Shaman, whose expression of fear was soon melted by curiosity at the engraving. &lt; Human, this is the best ritualistic engraving I have seen in my life! &gt;</p><p>&quot;Do you have any champions that have borne more than one engraving? I'm looking for clues on how a human body can support more.&quot;</p><p>&lt; Only two, both of whom are dead. Humans were never meant to support even one engraving in the first place. &gt; The Snow Song Shaman shook his head again.</p><p>&quot;I just need to know traits, quirks, any unique features.&quot;</p><p>&lt; Hmm.... For one, they can absorb Dzi Flower Sand into their body directly upon reciting the ritual words. She too can do it. &gt; The shaman pointed a gnarly finger at Sasha's hopeful expression, but Kyle was still unconvinced.</p><p>&quot;How many times have you tried to impart more than one.&quot;</p><p>&lt; Thirty times. Or was it fifty? I can't really remember, my head is foggy... &gt;</p><p>Kyle and Sasha tried to search the area for more clues, asking other members of the Snow Song tribe, but to no avail, only hearing rumors and tall tales that were clearly fabricated by storytellers over the decades. With nothing left to go on, the duo returned back to the training caves, Sasha pushing hard for Kyle to go through with the procedure. [Even if we took the shaman's worst case scenario of fifty, that's still a 1% chance, not 0.]</p><p>&quot;That's far lower than what you originally went through. It's too risky.&quot; Kyle was still hesitant. &quot;We will see next week when I am more prepared. I will study more on arctech engineering.&quot;</p><p>While he left the hopeful Sasha waiting, Kyle began to plan for Niko's and Monica's engravings as well, knowing that he had a very high success rate with just a single engraving now. The issue was to what engraving he should impart. As of now, Damian had a defense engraving, while Sasha had a force engraving. Theoretically, both Niko and Monica should also receive force engravings, but Kyle felt that they could be better specialized to their needs instead of having a generic one, something that should really elevate them to the next level of power.</p><p>He focused on Niko first, thinking carefully about his supposed growth plan. &quot;What engraving would you prefer?&quot; Kyle asked Niko during one of the individual weapon's training sessions, Niko now using a bow and arrow amateurishly.</p><p>&quot;Uh... I don't know. Something that makes my enemies go boom!&quot; Niko grinned, mimicking an explosion with his hands, simultaneously reminding Kyle that Niko's opinions hardly mattered now.</p><p>Instead, Kyle began to lean towards an engraving that could help in training rather than in combat. He needed an engraving that could accelerate Niko's weapons training faster without fatigue or time for rest, making use of every minute. He scoured the various arctech textbooks, looking for a relevant arctech engraving before finally finding a theoretical one that fit the bill.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Stamina Recovery Engraving (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>The engraving listed in the textbook was clearly rudimentary and have not been improved on, a small little note mentioning that it was a theory at best and yet to be implemented on any living creature, the research department of the University of Raktor clearly abstaining from human experimentation. Publicly, at least.</p><p>Kyle naturally took the note as a mere suggestion, quickly practicing the engraving before his Arcia Engraver title kicked in, swirls of information and hints at how to improve the quality surged into his brain like a rapid waterfall, akin to a cranial implant of sorts. He worked feverishly through long hours in the night, finally managing to improve the engraving.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Stamina Recovery Engraving (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Sleep is for the weak</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle took the engraving back to some of the remaining prisoners, practicing on them again. For each engraving that he had to do, the placement of the amalgamation beads was different, so Kyle had no choice but to put in the hours necessary to ensure Niko did not die.</p><p>Surprisingly, Kyle faced less of a problem than the force engraving of Riker's pipe, Kyle able to successfully impart the engraving onto five more prisoners in a row. Feeling the momentum, he hurriedly ordered the goblin nurses to call Niko in.</p><p>Soon, Niko found himself strapped in tightly into a clearly blood-stained table, with bits and pieces of exploded skin and flesh still strewn around the floor. He could feel the cold gloves of Kyle marking out the engraving's location on the back. &quot;This isn't going to hurt, right? I'm not a prisoner!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're not,&quot; Kyle smirked as he sharpened the edge of that taboo knife while Niko's mouth was stuffed unceremoniously with a cloth. &quot;But it will definitely hurt. Just think of all the girls you can hit on once u get this sorted.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Reall- ARRGGGHHHHHH!&quot; Niko belted muffled profanities and curses in such a combination that would annihilate anyone and their ancestors if they were the target at hand. His hands and legs flailed wildly, taking nearly four goblin slaves to hold him down on a single limb while Niko clenched hard onto the cloth in his mouth.</p><p>The procedure was longer than expected, Kyle having to smack Niko unconscious at one point to prevent him from potentially disrupting the surgery with the continuous squirm, as well as for Kyle's own sake due to Niko even throwing some vulgarities his way over the first ten minutes.</p><p>Finally, the carving was complete, with Niko's breathing still steady while the goblin slaves wiped the blood off his skin, revealing a slowly healing engraving glittering with the beads in specific places. Kyle confirmed the accuracy of the sequence with the textbook and his improved reference, before finally concluding the surgery by pouring a healing potion directly onto the wound.</p><p>Next was Monica's turn, and she already had a clear idea on the engraving she wanted. &quot;The main issue with my combat style is that I need to keep close to the target to be able to finish him off in one combo. Any engraving that would slow the enemy would work well.&quot;</p><p>Kyle agreed, and rummaged through the engravings in the various books and notes he had kept since coming to Raktor. He recalled one of the arctech equipment he had seen a long time ago, the engraving on it being a potential candidate.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Glacial Defensive Bracelet (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>However, such an engraving would require Monica to suffer a hit first, which was a downside that Kyle could not accept when it came to it being a human tattoo, as any direct blow on the body could have killing potential. Kyle flipped through a few books, coming across some slowing auras, but all of them required massive arcia consumption that Kyle himself wasn't sure his body could sustain.</p><p><em>If we can't slow the enemy, then we need an engraving that makes sure the opponent is finished off.</em> Kyle pondered a bit, laying out a few options. He could give Monica the generic force engraving, but he doubted it would be what she wanted. Niko's advice of making things go boom momentarily appeared in his head, though it was dismissed just as quick. Explosive engravings were dangerous as Kyle did not know how they performed on a human body.

<p></p><p></p><p>Speed engravings like that of the Aero Shoes would help Monica catch up, but Kyle still felt that she was lacking the power to really break her opponents apart. Even if Monica were to be able to get close to one of Harrison's hitmen, Kyle suspected that her punches would not be able to make a dent on the exosuit arm armor.</p><p>The Enchanted Flaming Hammer on the other hand, was a good engraving, something that could quite literally double Monica's strength and also prevent the target from escaping once a hit lands. Kyle began the usual procedure, testing and practicing on other bodies first before calling Monica over.</p><p>Monica was far more stable than Niko was during the surgery, though the engravings were not on the back like Niko's, but only on her right hand. Kyle wasn't about to put a second one on the left hand lest he lost Monica as well, the risk far too high. Thankfully, the surgery went off without a hitch, Monica awake through out the entire procedure. She clenched her rapidly healing hand, seeing the embedded Dzi Flower Sand in her knuckles.</p><p>&quot;Can you feel the engraving? You should be able to sense it as part of your body.&quot; Kyle instructed Monica on how to utilize it, having Sasha also guide Monica on acclimatizing to the inclusion of the tattoo. Monica threw a few punches, putting her focus on her right hand as the engraving began to glow slightly.</p><p>Kyle had Sasha and Monica go a practice round, with Monica still getting used to the engraving. However, the effects of it were immediately clear when Sasha tried to swing her falchion in. Instead of dodging, Monica slammed her right engraved fist into the flat side of the blade, knocking it askew while retaliating at Sasha.</p><p>Sasha easily dodged the counter-attack, taking one step and was about to launch another attack when a sudden blow from nowhere nearly knocked her falchion out of her grip, prompting Monica to pounce on the opportunity and rush Sasha.</p><p>While the duel still ended with Sasha successfully grappling Monica to the ground, the new inclusion of the Delayed Assault skill was proving to be a clear boon to Monica, who couldn't stop grinning. &quot;Now I'll be able to punch twice, literally.&quot;</p><p>However, the very next day, there seemed to be a problem as Kyle found out Niko was still unconscious, missing his individual training session. He wasn't waking up from his deep sleep, his breathing peaceful as he laid on a small single bed, Kyle and the other vipers gathering around him quietly. &quot;How long has he been like this?&quot; Kyle asked Damian.</p><p>&quot;Not sure, sir. About eighteen hours.&quot; Damian bent down and placed a finger near Niko's nose, checking for a breath.</p><p>&quot;Did something go wrong in the surgery?&quot; Monica asked.</p><p>&quot;Not that I am aware of...&quot; Kyle pondered a bit, crouching over and testing Niko's pulse on his wrist. &quot;Seems like he's truly unconscious.&quot;</p><p>The air in the room became slightly solemn, Damian's mood worsening as he looked at the peaceful face of Niko, contemplating the chance that Niko might be in a coma. &quot;What should we do, sir?&quot; Damian looked around the room. &quot;We could try to get some smelling salts. Perhaps have a doctor come and -&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. A smelling salt won't fix a botched surgery. He is a replaceable viper anyway, plenty of others willing to fill his position. Have the goblins chop him up and cart him off to the maggots-&quot;</p><p>&quot;WAIT WAIT WAIT!&quot; Niko suddenly lunged out, grabbing Damian's arm with a desperate grip. &quot;I'm okay, I'm okay, I was just pretending to be asleep! I just wanted some proper rest!&quot;</p><p>The tension in the atmosphere broke apart like clouds parting, the other vipers all groaning in unison while Kyle had a small smirk on his face, already knowing Niko was faking it. &quot;Good, so now that you had a proper rest, you should be able to do proper training. Damian, work up a physical routine twice as hard. With his new tattoo, he can handle it, don't worry about pushing him to the limit. Reduce his sleep hours as well.&quot;</p><p>Leaving the pleading cries of Niko behind, Kyle now only had Damian and Sasha's engraving left to be upgraded. The upgrading of an existing tattoo had never been done before even by the goblin shaman, so Kyle was definitely in the dark here, continuing his exhaustive work to attempt the new procedure of re-carving. It was also a mystery on whether he would be able to remove already existing engravings on the body, especially if the upgrade required new symbols in the middle of the sequence rather than at the end.</p><p>He started with Sasha's force engraving first, improving it on the metal plate before continuing to modify existing ones.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Reinforcement Engraving (Advanced)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>The improved version had a lower cost as well as a longer uptime overall during combat, proving to be far better than the one Sasha currently had. Luckily for Kyle, the upgraded engraving only required three more symbols attached to the end, so it was a simple job to simply extend the engraving.</p><p>In this fashion, both Damian's and Sasha's engraving were upgraded, though Sasha was still insistent on receiving the second engraving. Kyle had tried over the next few days to improve his success rate, but failed to see any measurable effects that could increase his chances. Sasha was simply too critical to run the test on.</p><p>With a week passing by like this, the training was progressing better than expected, each of the vipers hitting a new high in their capabilities and fighting strength, while Kyle obtained better engravings. The exosuit arm was all that was left for Kyle to attempt, before moving on to his own self-upgrades. Yet there was another problem that appeared - the prisoners who successfully survived the engraving process, many of them receiving the force-engraving, stamina recovery or delayed assault. &quot;Sir, what should we do with them? We should try to recruit some.&quot; Damian offered his suggestion.</p><p>&quot;How is Culo doing now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He's currently capped at three feral humans, and he's getting much more ruthless over time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. Send the prisoners to him one by one. I expect that after a week of that, we will have a new top fighter in the Seven Snakes.&quot;</p><p>@@@</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">* * *</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><strong>Chapter 99 - Payback Preparations</strong></p><p><em>A month later...</em></p><p>Wide-eyed children led by their parents squeezed with one another as they meandered along, following a bright lady waving a tiny little red flag hoisted at the end of what seemed to be a conductor's stick. The frills of her dress, coupled with the immaculate beauty of her face, dazzled and angered men and their wives respectively as she led a large group behind her, strolling down the wide streets underneath the towering housing apartments, some of which had just been recently completed.</p><p>&quot;And that's the end of the tour! We hoped you enjoyed your visit to the Golden Snakes shopping arcade and its various subsidiaries, where your dreams can come true!&quot; The lady smiled and took a bow to rising applause, some of the more daring children running forward to request a picture together. The tourists began to disperse one by one, flooding the already crowded high street and shopping arcade, looking to buy souvenirs back one by one.</p><p>The beautiful lady held a determined smile as she weathered the endless request for pictures, selling the photos by the hundreds for a tidy profit. It took nearly two hours before the queue and crowd finally began to thin out, though it did not mean that people had stop ogling at her. The lady was hardly worried about her security, however, as there was an entire squad of Seven Snakes covering her and keeping an eye out for anyone thinking a bit too far.</p><p>While the lady was about to raise her hand and wipe the sweat of her forehead, someone else firmly gripped her hand, forcing it down while using a cloth to dab the sweat off instead and chiding her : &quot;Careful, Emily. The makeup will be smudged if you do that. Need water?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you, Alex, that would be great.&quot;</p><p>&quot;OLLIE! Get some water for Emily here. Ollie!&quot; Alex glanced behind his shoulders, trying to spot where his squad's member had gone, only to find Ollie completely missing. His eyes locked onto Bola with a stern gaze, Bola immediately saluting and running off to find Ollie.</p><p>&quot;Bola, you fucking idiot, get the water fir- never mind.&quot; Alex's voice trailed off as he watched Bola disappear into the throng of people loitering outside the shopping arcade, many of whom were couples out on a date. &quot;Sorry about them. No idea why I'm in charge of kids.&quot;</p><p>&quot;At least they got energy. I'm tuckered out now, thank Yual that was the last one.&quot; Emily smiled as they both entered the air-conditioned interior of the shopping arcade. She took a seat carefully on a nearby bench facing outwards to the expansive foyer, taking great precaution to not crumple up her large skirt.</p><p>&quot;I wish they had less energy, at least that way they would actually listen to me. I feel like a babysitter instead of a cobra. Stay here, gonna get some drinks nearby. Any preferences.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh oh! I want the radish sherbet at Haui's cafe!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?! Are you serious? That thing is bland as hell!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No it's not, it has a good spice to it.&quot; Emily stood her ground.</p><p>&quot;Fine.&quot; Alex left to buy it, Emily soaking in the usual environment before she spotted someone unusual amidst the crowd. The moment Alex returned, she hurriedly grabbed his arm, shaking it violently and nearly causing him to drop the drinks.. &quot;Why, what's the matter?&quot; Alex asked confusedly.</p><p>&quot;Over there, over there! It looks like Kyle, right? Our boss!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah, you must have gotten it wrong. He wouldn't wear a such a funky yellow shirt like that out into the open.&quot; Alex muttered to himself until he saw the man put on a similar coat, just like Kyle's. &quot;Huh, I guess it's him. Didn't know he liked to idle at the foyer of the shopping arcade.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's what I'm saying! In fact I feel like I've been seeing him everywhere! Yesterday I saw him at the Lusty Arcian as well!&quot; Emily asserted while slurping on the sherbet, shivering slightly from the cold tingle. &quot;He was trying to hit up one of the other girls.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now that's a bit too far. Kyle has practically zero interest in the girls. I may not be a good judge of character, but Kyle wouldn't waste his time on things that don't improve him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; Emily shrugged as the two of them watched Kyle walk off into the distance. &quot;Maybe he got a bit lonely after all.&quot;</p><p>Alex didn't argue, but he soon recalled something strange as well. &quot;You know, now that you mentioned it, I did see him two days ago at the Seductive Serpent. Like the main branch. But he wasn't talking to the bartender or anything, just having a simple drink on his own.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe... maybe we're on to a secret side of Kyle!&quot; Emily got excited, her hands waving wildly. &quot;If only I could track what he does from time to time...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still, there's something clearly wrong. I got word that Damian, Monica, and Niko would be gone for a good while, along with Kyle and Sasha. Did you see Kyle last week?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did, I did! I saw him last week hanging around Thresher Street!&quot; Emily patted Alex's shoulder. &quot;What about you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I saw someone that looked like him, but I wasn't too sure. He was at the trade school's entrance, smoking an Euria Pipe.&quot;</p><p>Emily recoiled. &quot;Kyle doesn't smoke!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, but I never really thought too much about it. I mean, he has every right to take whatever substances he wants, really.... hold on, who's that?&quot; Alex squinted his eyes to the far end of the foyer, before gasping in shock. &quot;It's Kyle!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, that was what I said at the start-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, it's a different Kyle! Look he's walking back into the foyer from a different direction, with a completely different shirt!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? He has the same coat, though!&quot; Emily craned her neck in suspicion, though she could not deny that the man definitely looked a lot like Kyle, at least from afar.</p><p>&quot;This is bad. Someone is trying to impersonate him. All the other Kyles that we have been seeing might very well be imposters!&quot; Alex exclaimed, shooting out of his seat in horror. &quot;We must quickly warn the vipers. Stay here, I'll get my squad to catch him-&quot; His agitation was halted by Emily's firm grip on his arm.</p><p>&quot;No, let me approach him and try to stall him first, so he doesn't run away. You find your squad members and surround all the possible exits!&quot; Emily insisted, while Bola and Ollie finally returned, Ollie holding a nice small bouquet of flowers and handing it to Alex much to his confusion. Alex grabbed Ollie and Bola by the shoulder, dragging them out beyond Emily's hearing range.</p><p>&quot;What the hell is this for?&quot; Alex whispered angrily.</p><p>&quot;What you mean?&quot; Ollie gave a stunned look. &quot;The uncles in the slum told me you should buy flowers if you want to date a girl. Isn't it obvious?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You fucking brat, shut the fuck up now!&quot; Alex quickly snatched the bouquet of flowers away and stuffed it into his coat, before smiling nervously at Emily, who thankfully was still locked on the imposter in the foyer. &quot;Look, I'm a grown man, I know how to play the game, I don't need two kids telling me what to do!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know, boss, Niko seems to be doing a better job at getting dates than you are. You've been with her for a month now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You-&quot; Alex clenched his fist tightly, taking deep breaths to relax himself. &quot;Anyway, we got more important things to do. See that man over there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, Kyle? Weird.&quot; Bola scratched his head. &quot;I saw another Kyle on the way back here, a different one!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never mind that. Emily is going to talk to that imposter, and then we're going to surround and capture him, you hear? Secret mission!&quot;</p><p>Bola and Ollie immediately grinned, scampering off to the position that Alex had told them, forming a triangle around the imposter without arousing suspicion while Emily walked up to the man. Alex acted aloof as he paced slowly up and down the street near them, watching Emily talk to the man, ready to pounce at a moment's notice.</p><p>However, Emily suddenly recoiled, letting out a gasp as she took three steps back in shock. &quot;GO GO!&quot; Alex kicked into action, charging right at the imposter at full sprint, his thighs pumping as hard as he could as he launched himself in a direct shoulder tackle, nailing the imposter right in the guts and pinning him to the floor. Both of them tumbled to the floor while Alex wrestled him to the ground, the bystanders shouting and running away from the site. &quot;I got you, you little bastard. Emily, you alright? What did he do to you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm fine, sorry, sorry, Alex, I was just a bit startled.&quot; Emily spoke with a flustered face.</p><p>&quot;I din du nuffin, wats the meanin?&quot; The imposter blabbered, Alex immediately recoiling in shock too. &quot;Hei, wats with the look?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, I just uhhh.... I just never expected you to have such an accent...&quot; Alex mumbled too, understanding why Emily had let out a gasp. He just couldn't imagine someone who had Kyle's face to talk in such a gibberish manner.</p><p>&quot;I was pracitsin, n u just rondomly hit me. Wats the beg deal?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Practicing? Practicing what?&quot; Alex asked, the situation even far more confusing when he realized Bola and Ollie wasn't here. &quot;Where are they?&quot;</p><p>&quot;THERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE! GET HIM!&quot; Ollie roared in the distance, Alex turning to see the two of them charging yet another imposter who had just gotten of an arctech wagon, one who also looked like Kyle albeit holding a briefcase of sorts.</p><p>Ollie threw his body at the other imposter in a tackle, only to be grabbed and hoisted up by his collar, while Bola was sent flying and tumbling with a single kick. Alex gulped as he saw the real Kyle glare at the struggling Ollie, Kyle about to punch the living lights out of him for the surprise attack. &quot;So, this is treason?&quot; Kyle spoke with a clear intention to kill.</p><p>&quot;Sir, wait, wait, wait, it's a misunderstanding!&quot; Alex let go of the imposter, who tried to scamper away only to be held down by Emily's heels.</p><p>&quot;Misunderstanding...?&quot; Kyle looked around, his gaze locking onto the other captured imposter. &quot;Right, of course. Keith did not inform you, but these are my doppelgangers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Doppel... huh?&quot; Alex stared blankly.</p><p>&quot;Body doubles, essentially.&quot; Kyle dropped Ollie unceremoniously onto the ground. &quot;All of you, follow me.&quot;</p><p>He led all of them including the other imposters up to the shopping arcade's office, where the other doppelgangers requested long ago were gathered and being trained by Keith.</p><p>“You idiot, Kyle doesn’t pose like that. Be more menacing! More intimidating! And when you give a smirk, your eyes need to smile in a sinister way as well! And you should not smile very often either. And keep your body straight! Kyle doesn’t stick out his butt like that!” Keith used a wooden stick to tap the doppelganger’s body, pointing out the bad points of the posture.</p><p>“And when Kyle talks, he talks in a deep accent. Go bass! Go low! Feel the Kyle in your veins!” Keith passionately exclaimed like he was an instructor for actors. “When you walk, you got to walk like you’re the cock of the town. No one is above you; everyone is beneath you! Drill that into your mindset! Okay, now you! Number 3. Try Line 15.”</p><p>Number 3 stepped forward, clearing his throat as he approached Keith, who was already on the verge of tears. He arched his jaw forward while glaring at Keith with a fearsome expression. “Keith, I would like to ask you a simple question.”</p><p>Keith immediately burst out laughing, unable to hold back any longer. Number 3 frowned, wondering what he did wrong.</p><p>“HAHAHAHA…sorry…hah… it’s not your fault.” Keith wiped the tears of joy from his eyes. “It’s just that it’s such a good impression! It’s exactly like him when he first became leader!”</p><p>“Glad you found it funny.”</p><p>“Indeed… wait, wow! That was a perfect impression of Kyle; it sounds exactly like-“ Keith turned around to see who it was, only to come face to face with the real Kyle. He immediately straightened his back, standing at attention.</p><p>The real Kyle walked up to his table with the six doppelgangers and Keith lining up in front of him. It’s been a month since Keith recruited them. Emily, Alex and his squad could only marvel at just how similar they looked in both facial features and posture, though the accent was clearly distinguishable and hard to mask.</p><p>“Keith, have you tested them combat-wise?”</p><p>“Erm, well… they are competent. But none of them has the same strength as you.”</p><p>&quot;Good. Have them do a proper rotation. Keep them all in secret training - it's clear that if even our own cobras like Alex over here can tell the difference apart, it is not working as expected. For the rest of you, I trust that you will keep this a secret, even on pain of death.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; Everyone saluted, while Kyle had all but Keith dismissed from the office.</p><p>&quot;Sir, I assume the training went well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It did. Damian, Monica, and Niko will be returning tomorrow to assume their former positions. Good work holding down the fort. Updates on the businesses.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. Over the last month, we have now possessed more than a third of all land deeds in the three districts. Expansion of the Lusty Arcian and Seductive Serpent is being done hand-in-hand with facades of redevelopment, allowing us to build in fronts. Our advertising and marketing campaign is doing wonders - currently, our shopping arcade district has the fourth highest population, only outmatched by the Ardent Cretins and the Magda.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. I assume there has been no trouble so far.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not unless you include the usual thug rackets and small-time criminals trying to leech off our businesses. We now have Seven Snakes guards on regular patrol; we're basically the police now, and everything is feasible as long as we don't go overboard. The workers are all under control thanks to the moderate union - our bribed council members are helping us tame expectations and manage the wages as well as worker happiness. Fake negotiations have been performed recently to appease any potential dissidents. Some remnants of Gunther's union are still out at large, but have as of yet been of any issues.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enforcers, Red Lions?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No activity as seen. The Red Lions have paid back half of what we 'requested' from them. Bishop Vernette and Inquisitor Mason are still promoting the housing district. For the military exercise, it is about to begin in less than a week.“</p><p>&quot;Current finances?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Combining everything we've earned so far, we're currently holding at ninety million rakels. Much of the money has been allocated into developing new housing apartments and their respective infrastructure, as well as buying up land deeds at market price, forfeited by the landowners who retaliated against us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perfect. With the districts under us now fully stabilized, it's time to look further beyond. Raktor may be our starting point, but it is not the end of our growth.&quot; Kyle smiled.</p><p>&quot;Versia, sir? Adrian should have already delivered the information he had collected regarding the smuggling routes. It has information on Ocra's current defenses. You should have also received a package from Haui for the new makeup products necessary for the mission.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have indeed received it. Culo and Sasha have already been dispatched accordingly as the forward team. Through them, we'll begin to collect information on Harrison and his movements and subsequently plan our strikes. Once the other vipers return from training, begin stocking up and training more Seven Snakes in case another embargo were to befall us. We cannot rest on our laurels forever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Understood, sir.&quot; Keith complied, leaving to carry out the orders, while Kyle overlooked the district beyond the glass wall of his office, the construction and development of the district moving rapidly with an industrial fervor instilled in the air. It was the combination of amenities, technology and living standards that helped to gather and accumulate talent, money and resources under his banner, and now he was ready to expand it to the next level.</p><p>A more amateur gang leader in his position would think that the gang would need to take down the Ardent Cretins first before moving overseas, but that is far from true. Instead, attacking Harrison was the far safer play thanks to Kyle's close connections with Baron Cain and the enforcers, who would hardly tolerate any Versian attempts to destabilize Raktor further.</p><p>Now, the boot was on the other foot, and Kyle was ready to squash anything Harrison had to throw at him. <em>You've fucked with the wrong man.</em></p><p>@@@</p><p><em>At the Central Sector's Harbour...</em></p><p>Scores of workers and managers hollered out over the never-ending din of bells, machinery and rumbling of arctech engines, fuelling the heavy cranes that hoisted large wooden crates back and forth, loading them onto barges that ferried cargo down and up the main river that ran through the whole of Raktor.</p><p>The murky water stained with the refuse and sludge dumped by uncaring factories along the shores splashed against the grimy hull of a decrepit barge, the crates being marshalled in by workers who gingerly stepped through the mushy deck layered in a coat of algae, while two enforcers moved through the various cargo being hauled, a manifest of the items reported in their hands. &quot;Where's the damn captain of this ship?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Th-that would be me, sire.&quot; A grungy old man wearing tattered clothes limped over with a nervous smile, his clammy hands clasped together while rubbing feverishly. &quot;Anything that I can help you with...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know the rules - no classified technology to Versia, and no smuggling.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, of course! Feel free to check any cargo you want. But sire, I dont think the list is complete. We recently had a few new... additions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;New additions?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right here, sire.&quot; The old captain handed over a clipboard with a new manifest, the enforcer grabbing it only to feel a thick envelope hidden beneath it, filled with notes of rakels.</p><p>&quot;Hmmm... Only to Ocra and back, correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir. Nothing further.&quot;</p><p>The enforcer quickly pocketed the envelope into his coat, glancing around to make sure no one else was watching. &quot;Good, because if you were moving to Tenar by any chance... even I can't help you then.&quot;</p><p>The old captain waved his hands frantically in denial. &quot;No, no, no of course not! I'm not an idiot! Everyone knows there's bad things coming, I just wanted to keep my head down. You won't get no trouble from me, no sire.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright. Your barge is cleared. Clear the dock in ten minutes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, enforcer, right away.&quot; The old captain bowed lowly as he watched the two enforcers disembark, the two already preparing to split the bribe.</p><p>The captain's submissive behavior immediately disappeared the moment the enforcers were out of hearing range, assuming his full height as his back straightened while he entered the lower cabin of the barge, where there were rows upon rows of slaves trapped in cages, some of whom were still sobbing loudly, only stopping when he kicked the cage's grills violently. &quot;COME ON! SHUT THAT BITCH UP AND GET A MOVE ON! We got three trips to make today!&quot; He roared at the workers, spurring them on to move faster.</p><p>He returned back to the captain's quarters, where a well-dressed man wearing an immaculate suit complete with a handkerchief and monocle was sitting quietly, reading a newspaper while oozing the very epitome of wealth. The captain's submissive behavior appeared once more as he bowed respectfully to the man. &quot;Apologizes for the delay, Mr...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Culo.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Culo, yes. There are quite a few additional processes we needed to clear before making the transfer. I'm sure you understand that relationships between Versia and Raktor are.... tenuous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. But I have a deadline to meet, and if it is not met...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, no, we will be on time to deliver the goods as per promised.&quot; The captain hurriedly interjected.</p><p>&quot;Good. Then please, continue about your work.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir. Please enjoy the trip and do not hesitate to call for me if you require my assistance.&quot; The captain bowed out of the quarters, closing the door with a grin on his face. His lack of pride was hardly a concern to himself, his mind only filled with the thought of money to earn. <em>Only a bigshot can pay to smuggle this many slaves. If I can impress him, I'll be set for life!</em></p><p>While the captain giggled about his non-existent future, Culo on the other hand was paying great attention to every detail of the smuggling sequence - the loading of cargo, the masking of goods and slaves, the bribing of enforcers, his mind quickly jotting down each and every tiny facet to allow the Seven Snakes to replicate it when compiled. Even the names of those involved in the process were memorized for future references.</p><p>The barge lurched forward, the anchor raised as it began to slowly drift down the river at a snail's pace, the river's current carrying it along. The arctech motors onboard whirred to life, the reverberations shaking the flimsy shell of the barge violently as motorized paddles along the side of the barge inched outwards, before pushing the water in a rowing fashion. Culo glanced out of the porthole, watching the riverside pass by gradually, filled with the hustle and bustle of industrialization.</p><p>The smokestacks of various factories soared into the sky, chugging out black fog while the various ships moved goods along the river, even within the city. A barge filled to the brim with sand sailed past them, headed for a glass factory, while an empty food barge overtook them from the other side, heading back to the grain bins on the outskirts of Raktor to pick up more grain to fuel Raktor’s food demand. Culo slightly marveled at the drastic change from when he first come to Raktor as a starving factory worker. Now? He was returning to near his hometown, well-dressed and rich beyond his wildest dreams, not to mention bristling with strength and power thanks to the one month of training.</p><p>A few hours passed, with Culo sitting in silence and keeping a close eye on the route into Versia. The ferry passed a few more rows of factories as they neared the city of Ocra. He spotted a sign, demarcating the end of the County of Raktor and where the Versian border began. It took three hours on the river to even get a glimpse of city lights as day turned to night, the hue of arctech lanterns reflecting off the rolling clouds in the distance.</p><p>As they approached the city, Culo noticed men working along the side of the river, digging what seemed to be trenches and placing defensive fortifications that stretched more than a few kilometers, forming a defensive line, apparently having started more than three months ago. The entire river was gated between two towering secondary military forts with cannons aimed at the river, a metal grill preventing boats from crossing immediately.</p><p>[Halt! Security check!] A loud arctech speaker from the top of the gate bellowed towards the barge, while arctech spotlights flooded the deck brilliantly, dazzling the workers.</p><p>Culo could see from the windows of the captain's quarters that a team of Versian soldiers had boarded the deck of the barge randomly inspecting crates and workers for their purpose of visit, shoving the captain aside even when he tried to bribe and stall them. <em>That's not good.</em> Culo began to prepare himself, checking his equipment and clothes and making sure he was ready to go at a moment's notice.</p><p>Soon, three soldiers led by their squad leader made their way to the captain's quarter, coming across Culo with a clear look of disgust on their faces. &quot;What the fuck is a Versian doing on a Yual dog's barge?&quot; The Versian squad leader spat.</p><p>&quot;Why? Do I not have the right to choose my friends?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, of course not. Though I'm sure the friendship will not last long...&quot; The Versian squad leader was suddenly distracted by a sudden chirp on the arctech radio hooked to his belt.</p><p>[Sir, there are slaves in the lower cabin of the barge! Fifty of them!]</p><p>Before the Versian squad leader could even accuse Culo of being a smuggler, he was already faced with Culo's fist aiming right for his nose, the knuckles crushing into his face and sending him tumbling unconscious. With one swift motion, Culo drew a sharp knife from his coat, jabbing the cold blade straight into the neck of the other soldier who was caught offguard.</p><p>The remaining soldier tried to draw his rifle, but Culo closed the gap in no time, the knife thrusting right at the heart and cutting it open, killing the soldier on the spot. Culo hurriedly grabbed the fallen soldier's rifle and left the captain's quarter, but not before finishing off the unconscious squad leader. He rushed down to the lower decks, where there was already a brutal brawl going on, the slaves seemingly fighting back against the workers who were also fighting against the Versian soldiers. However, if one were to look closely enough, only ten of the fifty slaves were hitting back with skills far beyond what a slave should have, Sasha herself leading the charge and massacring anyone who had seen them save for the other slaves.</p><p>The sudden skirmish was over as soon as it had began, the workers, captain and Versian soldiers alike all killed and hunted down. Culo quickly approached the slaves, setting them free and giving them directions. &quot;If you want to survive, jump off the barge and swim to the left shore! Grab the weapons and move!&quot;</p><p>Following his word, nearly thirty of the surviving slaves armed themselves and began to escape the barge, with the alarm now blaring on the two secondary forts. The spotlights all focused on the swimming slaves, the Versian soldiers manning the turrets at a complete loss on whether to shoot them or not.</p><p>&quot;Rest of us, grab the gear and to the right shore! Sasha, clean up the ship!&quot; While the guards of the fort were preoccupied, Culo led the remaining ten slaves and scoured the ship, breaking apart specific crates in the lower cabin, unveiling a few units of Aspis MK1 knight armor, packed into large sacks. Sasha prowled the ship, checking for any remaining Versian soldiers or workers who might have seen them.</p><p>They hauled the sacks over the edge, dropping them into the water towards the right shore, jumping in after them while avoiding the spotlights who were far too focused on the escaping slaves. Gunshots and rapid pellet fire rang out through the cold night air as Culo braved the chilly waters, paddling frantically while lugging along a heavy sack that weighed him down greatly. His head began to sink underneath the water level as he struggled to fight the current, only to be finally hoisted by Sasha, his entire body lifted effortlessly and thrown onto the shore.</p><p>As soon as he made it to the shore, a large explosion rocked the barge, the dazzling fragments of unknown metal bits spilling out into the air in a ball of flame and light, Culo's group keeping low in ditches and underwater to prevent being spotted. &quot;Sir Culo, now that the route has been compromised, what do we do? Do we return to Raktor?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. We still have a way in.&quot; Culo had already learnt the information collected by Adrian, knowing there was still a gap in the walls that was currently built in a ring on the outer radius of Ocra.</p><p>The moment Sasha reached the shore, Culo ordered the other to pack their stuff up, motioning at them to follow her. They lug the sacks as they trekked through a muddy swamp, approaching close to a half-built wall where the workers had already gone to sleep. Exploiting the gap in the fences and walls, the group hurriedly sneaked by, entering the border of Ocra proper.</p><p>Within an hour, they found themselves close to the city of Ocra, the city far different from what Culo remembered. It was now built up with great walls and defenses, mounting points for cannons and siege weapons dotting the top of the fortifications. Countless trench lines and ditches were dug in the ground, the land and original forest cleared for miles. &quot;Over on the western side of the wall is a door reserved for members of Nest. It is here that we will be able to enter Ocra proper.&quot;</p><p>They kept low as they snucked through the trenches and muddy soil, keeping low to avoid detection by patrols and watchtowers intermittently dispersed along the side of the wall. Sasha's keen senses helped them to see who was looking their way, every member hinged on her every command. With expert manuovering, they made it to the wall without a hitch, hugging along its coarse rugged bricks while Culo felt around for a secret brick. &quot;Get your rifles ready.&quot;</p><p>Soon, he found it, a loosened brick that somehow acted as a door handle as well, Culo pushing in to reveal a spiral staircase that led downwards.</p><p>Panicked voices could be heard from the bottom of the stairs, clearly discussing what had just happened to the barge. &quot;Did you see the explosion? Wasn't that one of the smugglers' barges?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yea, it must have been a bad one. Those new Versian guards from Tenar don't fuck around, they barely take any bribes at all, it's like they are all possessed- wait a minute. Did you hear someone enter?&quot;</p><p>Culo immediately signalled to the squad, prompting them to launch an attack as they rushed down the staircase into what seemed like an underground cavernous pub, smugglers and criminals of all types gathered together. In a withering barrage of fire, the pellets whizzed across the cavern, killing most of them caught off guard. Some of the more fortunate ones cowered behind wooden tables and chairs now pockmarked with pellet holes, others scampering for the exit. However, those trying to flee only found themselves facing Sasha, who easily cut them down one by one with little to no effort.</p><p>The blitz attack ended in mere seconds, allowing Culo and Sasha to now gain a proper foothold into Ocra. Culo grabbed one of the surviving smugglers, dragging him onto a chair and aiming the tip of a knife right at his face. The smuggler tried to put on a brave face, grinning at Culo: &quot;Do you even know who you're fucking with? This city is ran by Masir!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Masir? Who even is that? Last I heard, it was Makoa.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That rat went to Raktor a long time ago. Masir is the one in charge now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How many men?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A hundred, maybe even two. You better let me go, or else he'll-&quot;</p><p>Culo smacked the smuggler hard, tossing him onto the floor next to the other surviving smugglers who were all now rounded up by the rest of his squad.</p><p>&quot;As you can all see, our outfit - my outfit - is small, but there's plenty of room for aggressive expansion. Now, let's put it this way.&quot; Culo grabbed a rifle from another squad member, aiming the barrel at the first smuggler. &quot;Masir, or me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think you can -&quot; A loud bang had a pellet tear through the brains of the smuggler, him dying immediately. The remaining smugglers stared in horror while Culo immediately swiveled the rifle to the next man.</p><p>&quot;Now, Masir? Or me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 100 - Village</strong></p><p>A distant thud rumbled across the clear skies, the vibrations shaking the trees slightly as a small cloud of smoke drifted into the air above the forest between Ocra and Raktor, birds and animals alike scampering in all directions away from it.</p><p>The reverberations were all too familiar to an arctech engineer, as he tried his best to compartmentalize the sound away in his mind, his gloved hands and eyes focused on the broken arctech irrigation pump in front of him. He had to get this fixed by tomorrow, but it was even harder to concentrate when the same dull thuds kept echoing through his small village workshop, frightening him.</p><p>&quot;Jakub, everything okay?&quot; His wife called out to him from the nearby kitchen, a look of worry as she poked her head around a corner, where the smell of caramelized sweets wafted in over the metallic tinge of arctech machinery.</p><p>&quot;Sorry dear, I.... I just can't focus.&quot; Jakub sighed, putting down his gloves.</p><p>His wife put down whatever she was cooking, turning off the arctech stove before walking over, patting him carefully on the shoulder. &quot;Is it the artillery shells? They are just doing an exercise, nothing more. We're miles away from them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, I know... it's just...&quot; Jakub took a deep breath, leaning against the workbench and looking up at the ceiling, arctech lanterns dotting the thatched roof precariously on wooden beams. &quot;My brother is in Raktor now. I just wonder if he's caught up in everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're such a worrywart, Culo is doing perfectly fine. Didn't he send us money just last month? He must be making a killing there to be able to send that much. If it wasn't for his job we might have not enough funds to make it through the coming year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I... guess you're right. But recently I've been hearing stories from the others about how everyone is evacuating out. Maybe we should consider leaving too, in case a war really breaks out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sure level-heads will prevail, the last civil war is still fresh in the people's heart, they won't advocate for any more suffering.&quot; His wife consoled him. &quot;Either way, this is our home. We were born here, married here, and soon we'll have our own family to take care of here too.&quot; She pulled Jakub's hand towards her tummy, Jakub feeling a slight bump.</p><p>&quot;It might be safer in Ocra, for all we know.&quot; Jakub still harboured anxiety. &quot;The Versian army will protect us, at the very least.&quot;</p><p>His wife sighed, showing signs of exasperation. &quot;I think you need to take a break. How about some sweets, hmm? Calm your nerves a little.&quot;</p><p>Jakub complied, about to follow his wife into the kitchen when he suddenly heard a loud commotion over the hum of his arctech furnace beyond the walls of the workshop. Shouts and clamouring could be heard, before someone violently rasped against the door with vigor, clearly agitated. &quot;Stay in the kitchen.&quot; Jakub motioned to his wife, while he grabbed a nearby arctech hunting musket, heading to the door carefully, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>He tugged the door handle open, revealing a disheveled girl dressed in a work shirt and pants, her hands also holding a red-tipped woodcutter's axe. &quot;Lisa? What's going on?&quot; Jakub asked.</p><p>&quot;There's soldiers from Ocra, lots of them!&quot; Lisa blurted with clear agitation, Jakub able to see some of the other villagers exiting their houses, armed with similar axes and rallying together.</p><p>&quot;How many of them? What do they want?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe two dozen, all armed to the teeth with rifles and armor! They wanna evacuate us forcibly!&quot;</p><p>Jakub could already tell that there was a confrontation erupting between some of the villagers and the Ocra soldiers, arguments lobbied back and forth. He went back into the house, finding a small handgun and passing it to the wife. &quot;Use it if you have to, I'm gonna try to calm down the situation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Jakub, stay safe!&quot; His wife nodded and let him go, Lisa leading him towards the village square where an angry mob was already facing off against the Ocra soldiers, led by a sergeant who's strong body towered over most of the villagers. They congregated under the central bell tower, where a few kids looked down curiously at the commotion beneath them.</p><p>&quot;Who are you to force us to leave our homes! If those damn Yual dogs come our way, we'll give them a hell of a thrashin!&quot; A villager waved his woodcutter's axe frantically in the air.</p><p>&quot;Damn right, this is our homeland! We aren't gonna just up and leave without a fight!&quot; Others chimed in, echoing the same sentiment.</p><p>&quot;Citizens, please.&quot; The sergeant spoke with a clear somber voice. &quot;While I know the pain and hardship you may endure, this village is too close to the border and is likely to be attacked. As soldiers of the Versian military, it is our best interest to reduce civilian casualties and -&quot;</p><p>&quot;How about you say what you truly mean: you just want to steal all our land and property!&quot; One of the more cynical villagers spat back, clearly lacking trust in the Versian army. &quot;I bet once we leave, you're gonna swoop in and claim everything as yours!&quot;</p><p>The accusation spread like wildfire, especially the less educated villagers who were susceptible to such rumours and fear-mongering, the crowd turning against the Ocra soldiers, steps being taken forward.</p><p>&quot;I assure you that we only have your best interests at heart. In the next week or two, an attack by forward Raktor scouts may very well be possible! We are here to help you evacuate to Ocra!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bullshit! You're just chasing away from our ancestors' land!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yea, dem Raktor boys are just practicing, they ain't actually gonna cross the border! You're just tryna scare us!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Despicable soldiers, shame on you!&quot; An old lady threw an apple at the soldier, heralding a flinging of fruits, mud and other excretions at the Ocra soldiers and the sergeant, whom were near their breaking point, the sergeant himself about to order the soldiers to arm themselves.</p><p>&quot;STOP! STOP!&quot; Jakub waved his hands in the air as he shoved through the throng of villagers, pushing to the front and defending the sergeant with his own body, taking the brunt of the thrown fruits and rocks before the villagers realized who it was. &quot;Please, let us think carefully before making any rash actions or antagonizing anyone!&quot; Jakub pleaded. &quot;Let me speak with the sergeant.&quot;</p><p>The villagers' raised hands began to drop one by one, murmurs exchanged among each other as they complied, allowing Jakub a moment's respite to wipe off the mud slung at him. &quot;Apologies for the less than warm reception.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finally, some semblance of civility in this backwater village. What's a educated man like you doing in such a place?&quot; The sergeant too lowered his arm, the soldiers no longer priming their rifles to fire.</p><p>&quot;I prefer a quiet life. Either way, I'm sure its obvious that the villagers do not want to move for the time being.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you must know that tensions between Versia and Raktor are higher than ever. The artillery strikes from their military exercises are at the very edge of our borders.&quot; The sergeant explained. &quot;Under my orders, I cannot allow this village to fall into enemy hands as a staging point for further invasion into Ocra.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I completely understand, but would it not be better if we were somehow incorporated into the defense plan, if any? The motivation to defend our homeland could be utilized well against any possible invasion, however unlikely.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unlikely? We stand at the brink of war, it's almost certain. All it takes is for one trigging incident for hell to break loose.&quot; The sergeant retorted. &quot;To be frank with you, I couldn't care less if you half-breeds died in the first wave. Consider it a grace that you have even been offered help to evacuate.&quot;</p><p>Jakub's eye slightly twitched, but he suppressed his anger. However, the villagers had already heard what the sergeant said, rage rising amidst the mob. &quot;He dare call us half-breeds? We have every right to Versia just as much as you!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yual dog blood runs in your veins, and that much is clear from your mannerisms.&quot; The sergeant scoffed. &quot;If you breed two different races, what else can you call it but a half-breed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You fucking bitch!&quot; A large stone was hurled right at the sergeant, nailing him right in the face and knocking him out cold, while the Ocra soldiers began to panic when faced with a swarming angry mob, having lost their chain of command.</p><p>&quot;Please, everyone, take a step back! We don't have to fight each other!&quot; Lisa glanced around, flustered as the tensions rose, the bodies converging in the square and facing off against one another. Her desperate attempts at restoring peace through dialogue was interrupted by a loud gunshot. One of the fresher recruits among them freaked out, firing a pellet that nailed a villager right in the thighs, evoking a cry of pain that rallied even more villagers against them.</p><p>&quot;STOP! HOLD YOUR FIRE!&quot; Jakub roared, trying to calm down the villagers, but it was no use. A violent melee brawl broke out between the two sides, knuckles clashing and pellets shot wildly, axes swinging into flesh and bone as Jakub struggled to force his way through. Yet his voice alone was not enough to quell the unrest, the Ocra soldiers both unwilling to kill their own citizens or move without their sergeant's order. Soon, most of them decided to retreat, hauling the still unconscious sergeant away from the village.</p><p>&quot;That's right you fucks, RUN!&quot; One of the villagers cheered as he wiped off a bloody nose, but he was soon confronted by an angry Jakub who grabbed him by the collar, shaking him violently.</p><p>&quot;Have you any idea what you have just done?&quot; Jakub bristled with fury, his tone simmering. &quot;You just fought against the damn military! What happens when they come back with an even stronger detachment? You've just marked the entire village as rebels!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Relax, kiddo. Just cuz you're the engineer of the village don't mean you smarter than us. They wanted us to leave!&quot; The villager waved his hand to the surrounding forest that had been Jakub's childhood, a few others nodding in agreement including Lisa. &quot;If we leave, it'll be a disgrace to the work of our fathers and grandfathers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That doesn't mean its worth fighting against the state's military! We won't be able to defend against them if they come back.&quot; Jakub stood his ground.</p><p>&quot;Then what? We leave with nothing but what we can haul, and with nothing to show for it!&quot; Another villager shouted back.</p><p>&quot;We can start again, start anew somewhere else, somewhere further away from the war...&quot; Jakub tried to convince them, but he was already starting to lose their interest and attention.</p><p>&quot;That's easy for you to say. You're an arctech engineer - anywhere you go, your skill will be needed. What skill would me, a simple woodcutter and farmer have in Ocra? Nothing!&quot; Yet another villager heckled Jakub. &quot;Now if you would shut up and step aside, we got a home to defend! You can leave if you want to, smartass. Always looking down on us since you were a fucking kid. At least your brother is doing something useful!&quot;</p><p>Jakub wanted to retort, but soon realized it was useless, the mob having made up his mind. Defeated, he stepped away from the mob, intending to walk home when Lisa blocked his path. &quot;Jakub, look, I know they are idiots, but we gotta do something for them. If things really start to go south... we should help out.&quot;</p><p>He rested a heavy palm on her shoulders, pushing her slightly aside and continuing to walk off, Lisa trailing behind trying to convince him. &quot;Please, Jakub. I'm on your side here: fighting the military was a stupid idea, but now that it has happened, we need to start-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lisa.&quot; Jakub interrupted her. &quot;You're barking up the wrong tree. I'm not the village chief - your dad is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But he's-&quot;</p><p>&quot;In Ocra to sell crops, yes. So it is down to you. Are you really going to stand by these suicidal idiots? We hardly have the weaponry and equipment to fight back any attack from either Raktor and Versia, and somehow we've painted a target on ourselves for both of them.&quot; Jakub ranted, walking faster and leaving Lisa behind. &quot;You can save them yourself, I'm leaving with Lucy tonight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Jakub! JAKUB!&quot; Lisa shouted from afar, watching Jakub disappear into his workshop and locking the door shut.</p><p>Jakub let out an exasperated sigh as he stormed to his workshop, packing up everything, while his wife nervously looked at him in confusion. &quot;Jakub, I heard shots, is everything okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, nothing is okay. Pack your bags, we're leaving by evening. Grab everything of value that we have.&quot; Jakub mumbled as he picked up a sack, shoving his etcher, tools and whatever else he could fit in, hauling all of them out into a back garage where an arctech wagon sat silently.</p><p>&quot;Why, what's wrong? Jakub, don't be paranoid again, there's no war-&quot;</p><p>&quot;NO WAR?&quot; Jakub slammed his fist against the table. &quot;The villagers out there just decided to punch the living lights out of a Versian military sergeant of all people, and they still think they are safe here?! Now, if you really understand what is going on, please, please pack up now. We need to be gone before the villagers come to me for help. I can't let you or the kid die, do you understand?&quot;</p><p>The wife's face paled at the revelation, nodding vigorously before hurrying into the rooms, snatching and packing everything they could into suitcases and luggages, stocking up the arctech wagon in full. Jakub packed all of the arctech hunting muskets he had, loading them into wooden cases, hoping to be able to sell them at Ocra if they needed extra cash. It took nearly three hours, the last glimmers of daylight finally dipping over the horizon as the wagon was filled with their belongings, ready to depart, Jakub raising the garage door to reveal a seemingly quiet village gravel road.</p><p>His wife looked back at the semi-empty house, the new furnishings that they had just crafted right after the wedding a few months ago left alone, barren as ever. She tugged at Jakub's sleeves before he entered the cabin of the wagon. &quot;Jakub, maybe we can talk it out with them. You've always been the smart kid of the village, we could try and convince them-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Convince them of what? They see me as different, as a smartass. Well if they don't want my help, I'm more than happy to leave them to the fate that they chose.&quot; Jakub grunted, shrugging off his wife's hand and clambering into the driver's seat. &quot;I'm done with this village.&quot;</p><p>Jakub twisted a knob and jumpstarted the engine, the arctech engine whirring into life as a sudden defeaning explosion rocked the entire garage, though it did not come from the wagon. &quot;What was that?!&quot; His wife exclaimed in horror, as bright dazzling glints of flame began to cast shadows upon the garage.</p><p>He peered through the cabin's window, seeing an entire house burst out into flames, the wooden fragments sailing through the air, drawing trails of smoke through the evening sky as villagers began to swarm out of their houses, shocked and afraid. A bell began to toll from the village square, one that usually heralded the end of the workday. Except this time, it was ringing with an anxiety unlike ever before.</p><p>&quot;We need to go!&quot; Jakub began to floor the pedal, the wagon rolling forward into the chaos as shouts and screams echoed through the normally peaceful village.</p><p>Instead, his wife grabbed Jakub's arm tightly, locking eyes with him and forcing the wagon to come to a halt. &quot;Jakub! You promised Culo you would protect the village for him! And here you are running away!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let go of me, Lucy! If we stay still any longer, we will die!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And if we leave, what do we have left to live for, knowing we let our own friends die when we could have saved them!&quot; His wife screamed back at him. &quot;If you're not going to defend this village, I'll do it myself!&quot; She jumped out of the cabin, the small handgun in her right as she charged towards the billowing flames erupting from the burning house.</p><p>&quot;LUCY! Fuck!&quot; Jakub rammed the wagon's gear into reverse, pushing back into the garage before dismounting and cracking open the back, hauling out the crates of muskets that he had packed. As he carried the first crate out, he spotted a desparate Lisa running towards him, her originally anxious face now overwhelmed with a deep sense of betrayal, seeing Jakub's wagon all packed up and ready to go.</p><p>&quot;LISA! Help me arm the villagers!&quot; Jakub roared over the din of gunshots and pellets, his heart palpitating with uncertainty as he watched the last trails of his wife's dress disappear around the corner to an unknown fate. He gritted his teeth, hauling out the crates of hunting muskets as fast as he could. Lisa shook herself out of her stupor, shoving her doubts to the back of her mind and rushing to help. A few villagers also charged over, grabbing a musket and a pouch full of muskets. &quot;Don't forget to grab the arctech packs, you need them to shoot!&quot; Jakub motioned over to the wagon, the small self-patented packs ready to go.</p><p>Soon, Jakub himself was rushing out, armed to the teeth with his own muskets and arctech packs, chasing frantically after where his wife was, hoping to the Goddess that she was not dead yet. He turned the corner sharply, coming face to face with the full brunt of a heatwave erupting from the burning house, where victims were being carried out of the fiery wooden wreck crackling with fury.</p><p>He spotted his wife carrying a kid out of the house, laying him down as the kid coughed violently, his entire face covered in blackened soot, while other villagers were attempted to splash buckets of water onto the burning house to no avail. Sprinting up to his wife, he knelt beside her, checking the kid's pulse. &quot;Who's attacking? Who set it on fire?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know, but others are saying an artillery shell hit the house head-on, an incendiary explosive that blew them up from within!&quot;</p><p>Jakub glanced around, noticing plenty of bodies being laid outside, many of them having suffered first-degree burns. The moment he heard Lisa's footsteps catching up behind him, he quickly ordered them to fan out towards the border. &quot;Make sure no one is coming to attack, if they are, we have to stall them while we evacuate the rest!&quot;</p><p>As soon as he said that, an unmistakable whizz through the air could be heard before something large slammed right into the bell tower, snapping the stone foundations in half while he watched a man fall from the top, his body smashing against the rubble like paste, his bones broken apart in a bloody mess that splattered onto the white tiles of the square.</p><p>&quot;Lisa! We still have three more wagons, right? Forget stalling the attackers, grab them and load everyone up, we're getting out of the village! You two, help her out!&quot;</p><p>Lisa nodded, but was stopped by the same violent villager who had punched the sergeant in the first place. &quot;Look at you two - village chief's daughter and smartass. First instinct is to fucking run! We should stay and defen-&quot;</p><p>His words were cut short by a sudden straight punch from Jakub, toppling the villager over onto the ground hard. &quot;Defend against that?! We got nothing! Only a military point defense can take that down - Lisa, move!&quot;</p><p>The able-bodied villagers began to haul what they could, carrying the injured first and foremost into the wagons that Lisa began to organize into a convoy near the centre of the square. Another artillery shell blasted yet another house, sending sparks racing through the air, spurring the survivors to move faster. Jakub and his wife too rushed back to their own wagon, driving off quickly to join the convoy. Some of the more greedy villagers tried to stuff furnishings and furnitures, only to have them tossed out by Jakub and Lisa, prioritizing lives first. Even Jakub threw away most of his tools to make space for everyone.</p><p>Within fifteen minutes, Jakub led the convoy off, the wagons rumbling out from the burning village as the embers began to drift onto other houses, causing the fire to spread faster than ever. He looked at the side-view mirror of the wagon, watching the flames lick what was left of his childhood, wondering what would have happened if he had just left them behind. His wife noticed his depression, gripping his soot-covered hands tightly. &quot;You did the best you could, we saved almost all of them! We can rebuild once the war is over.&quot;</p><p>That only raised his anger even more towards those who fired the shells. &quot;Those damn Yual dogs, using us as target practice! I'll fucking kill them if I ever get the chance again.&quot; He promised himself as the burning village began to disappear into the distance.</p><p>The journey was long and harrowing, the bumpy gravel road hardly alleviating the burns of those who survived the fire, their bodies still groaning in agony. There was barely enough potions salvaged from the village to go around, Lisa eventually deciding to give the potions to the children instead to lessen their suffering. &quot;Once we get to Ocra, we can buy potions, we'll sell off what we have.&quot; Jakub explained to Lisa as they took a break, the villagers gathering around a temporary campfire set up on the side of the road, boiling a large pot of soup made of the last vestiges of their harvest.</p><p>Morale among the villagers were lower than ever, most noticeable of all being the violent villager who had regained consciousness. &quot;Our grain, our livestock, our forest... all gone because of Raktor!&quot; The sentiment of hate began to take root among the villagers as they could still see in the dark the plumes of smoke and flickering red light emitting over the horizon.</p><p>&quot;We'll get our revenge soon enough.&quot; Jakub consoled the villagers, many of them now looking to him as a competent leader alongside Lisa. As they continued their journey, they soon began to meet other refugees from other villagers as well, realizing that the strikes were a concerted effort by the enemy to drive them out.</p><p>&quot;Why didn't they hit our convoy when we were leaving? If they were able to hit our village, they must have seen us.&quot; Lisa pondered in deep thought.</p><p>&quot;They must have wanted to capture us alive. Don't think too much about it, thank the Goddess that we made it out alive.&quot; Jakub murmured, his eyes tired from hours of driving on the road, their convoy now merging with others to form a large train that chugged along slowly towards Ocra, its fortress walls looming in the distance. &quot;Almost there, chin up. We can meet up with your father soon.&quot;</p><p>As the wagons began to lurch into the vicinity of Ocra, Jakub could see hundreds of makeshift tents and corrugated metal shelters stacked next to each other in close proximity beyond the walls, thousands of refugees from villages all over clamoring to get entry into the city. Jakub gripped his wife's hand tightly, hoping for the best. Their wagon was stuck in a queue as they were cleared one by one by Versian soldiers blockading the slums outside Ocra, their identity being checked one by one.</p><p>Soon, it was their turn, the wagon rolling up to a sergeant motioning for his soldiers to check the contents of the wagon. &quot;Name? Purpose?&quot;</p><p>Lisa took point, clearing her throat and raising her stature to the highest she could.&quot;Good sir, we're refugees evacuating from Creek March, and we got injured that needs immediate medical atten-&quot;</p><p>&quot;How many adults?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said, how many adults?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, we have kids who are suffering from burns and-&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you're not going to ask the question, I'm going to have to arrest you on grounds of obstruction.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?! Are you even listening to me, you-&quot; The furious Lisa was quickly restrained by Jakub, who gave a nervous smile to the intimidating sergeant.</p><p>&quot;Apologies, we have about thirty men and forty women. Our village chief is in the city, maybe you kno-&quot; Jakub could only watch as the sergeant barely listened to him, instead rummaging in a box and grabbing a handful of small little paper cards, shoving them into Jakub's hands without warning.</p><p>&quot;Here, your ration cards. Now, you're gonna have to leave your wagons with us. You can keep your belongings, but only after our soldiers have checked it. Your allocated tents are on the cards. Now move along.&quot; The sergeant brushed him off, motioning for the next wagon to come.</p><p>Before Jakub could do anything, he was shoved out of the way by other soldiers, who began to inspect the wagon carefully. They flipped open the crates of muskets and arctech packs, before quickly calling the sergeant over, who's eyes widened in shock. Instead of the previous intimidating demeanour, the sergeant was now smiling from ear to ear, quickly running up to Jakub and shaking his hands. &quot;Good sir, are you by any chance an arctech engineer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I am, but what's going on-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perfect. We are in dire need of your skills for the war effort, and you will of course be rewarded handsomely for your efforts, naturally. Please, follow me.&quot; The sergeant motioned with his hand, prompting Jakub to follow, but Jakub refused to budge.</p><p>&quot;I'm not going anywhere without my wife. And my friends still need medical attention.&quot;</p><p>A small glimmer of exasperation flashed across the sergeant's face, before quickly being replaced by the same compliant expression. &quot;Of course, of course. Your wife can follow too, and your friends will be taken care of.&quot;</p><p>Jakub found the man's demeanour suspicious, but he still did not want to start a fight against the military, not when the villagers under his care were still in dire need of aid. He and his wife followed the sergeant and two other soldiers carrying some of his crates to a luxurious tent, the interior being revealed to be a quaint little office where a lone officer sat on a small little wooden chair, yawning ever so slightly.</p><p>The officer stared at Jakub and his wife, both of whom were still covered in soot and blood stains, his face clearly irked by the disgusting stench of sweat. His fierce glare landed on the sergeant. &quot;Sergeant Mord, if this is another botched attempt at claiming a commission...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, no, of course not! The last one was an honest mistake! Look, we have some of his products here, found in his wagon.&quot; The sergeant ordered the two soldiers to open Jakub's crates, revealing his own self-patented arctech packs, the officer nearly leaping out of his seat.</p><p>&quot;This... this is a compressed fuel pack. How efficient is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;About a third of a fuel pack, but at a tenth of the mass and envelope.&quot; Jakub stated proudly despite his suspicions.</p><p>&quot;Perfect.&quot; The officer reached into a drawer, retrieving a pouch and tossing it to the gleeful sergeant, who left the tent with the other two immediately. &quot;The Versian state has need of your prowess with arctech engineering. Starting from tomorrow, you will be transferred to Tenar and working for Harrison Industries to support the war effort.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?!&quot; Jakub exclaimed in shock. &quot;But sir, my wife and the other villagers who came with me...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your wife will accompany you as well, you will be safe in the capital. As for the others, you have my word that they will be well taken care of. In fact, it is thanks to your skill that they shall have priority, more rations and medical supplies than the others. If you work hard enough, it may be enough to help them apply for refugee status within the city of Ocra itself, or even Tenar!&quot; The officer smiled as he pulled out a stack of paper, laying them on the contract. &quot;All you have to do is sign here, and the state will see to it that you, your family and your friends are safe.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... oh thank you so much!&quot; Jakub's anxiety melted away, everything he had hoped for and better was coming true in Ocra. He had feared that they would have been forced to struggle to make ends meet as evacuees, but here in front of him was a golden lifeline for both him and his wife. Without hesitation, he glanced through the contract, seeing that everything was as the officer said, being a regular labour deal. He signed it within five minutes, before shaking hands with the officer and hugging his wife tightly. &quot;We're safe, we'll be safe, thank Versia!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You should be thanking Harrison, he is the one funding all of this and putting our best minds to good use. We have a convoy setting off in an hour's time, I suggest that you spend the remaining time saying your temporary goodbyes to the others. Depending on your work, you could be seeing them in a month's time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you!&quot; Jakub shook the officer's hand again feverishly, his wife equally elated at the prospect, especially after the near escape. They returned giddy to the other villagers, who were all now disembarking the wagon, with Jakub explaining what was about to happen to them.</p><p>&quot;That's great, Jakub! Thank you for getting the help we need.&quot; Lisa hugged Jakub, her worries also evaporating away, regaining hope for the future. &quot;Are you sure you're going to be okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry, I'll be seeing you all soon, Lucy and I will work as hard as we can in Tenar to bring all of you over. Stay alive, you hear?&quot; Jakub grinned, rubbing a few of the kids heads playfully as he went around, saying his goodbyes. Soon, he and his wife were leaving with their belongings, leaving Lisa alone to take care of the villagers, her hands now possessing the ration cards.</p><p>She approached the sergeant happily, but soon noticed something wrong with their wagons as the soldiers checked it. Instead of driving them off to the side, the soldiers were stripping the wagons down for parts and hauling all of their belongings away to an unknown place. &quot;Uhh, sir? sir?&quot; She tapped the sergeant on the shoulder, only to earn a confused gaze.</p><p>&quot;Huh? Who are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm Lisa, I'm friends with the arctech engineer you just recruited to Tenar, and he told us -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yea. Right, line up over there to get your rations.&quot; The sergeant jabbed his thumb over his shoulder to a two-hundred strong snaking queue over at the other side of the fence into the slum, the cold night wind causing many of the old refugees queuing to shiver in their ragged clothing.</p><p>&quot;Sir, sorry, that can't be right.&quot; Lisa let out a nervous laugh. &quot;Your soldiers are tearing apart our wagons and stealing our belongings! Jakub said that we got priority and more rations and...&quot;</p><p>&quot;And is this Jakub around?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you fucking deaf? Where is this Jakub? Now you better get in line before I have to resort to force.&quot;</p><p>The violent villager stormed up to the sergeant, defending Lisa. &quot;That's no way to talk to us, you fucking upstuck twat. Jakub got word from the officer that-&quot;</p><p>Instead of a reply, the villager was shot right in the legs, crippling him as he doubled over in pain, the sergeant's handgun still smoking. The sudden violence frightened the other villagers into submission, Lisa horrified at the sudden twist in treatment while the Versian soldiers began to surround them, aiming their rifles right at them.</p><p>The sergeant scowled as he waved his handgun's barrel at them, earning screams from the villagers. &quot;Get in the damn line, you fucking half-breeds, else you can starve for as long as you want!&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 101 - War Refugees</strong></p><p><em>A week later...</em></p><p>Lisa awoke once again to the never-ending sound of flapping cloth, the hot morning gusts billowing through the half-patched tent as she lay on a thin mat that was synonymous with the rough uneven ground that jabbed into her back. Her eyes could barely open, a stinging sensation from the dust and soot trying to get their way in combined with the exhaustion of yesterday swirling in her mind. The air of the tent was stuffy and humid, filled with the exhalations and sweat of thirty other refugees from various other towns or villages like Lisa, all struggling awake again.</p><p>A sudden clarity infused her mind as she realized what she was supposed to do, her body sharply twisting around to check on a boy laying right next to her, the boy's body wrapped in pus-stained bandages, some fluids already seeping beyond the edges of the cloth onto the ground, pooling. Lisa hurriedly reached for a small leather bag near her mat, taking out a fresh roll of cloth.</p><p>She gingerly removed the bandage, the boy groaning as his burn scabs were melded with the cloth, Lisa slowly peeling away the cloth bit by bit. The extent of the burn was horrific, encompassing more than a third of his body, the boy having been caught right in the middle of the fire that struck the village last week. As Lisa twirled up the old pus-stained cloth, preparing to discard it, the boy clasped Lisa's arm tightly, his voice exasperated and weaker than ever. &quot;Lisa... just....&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not giving up on you, Selas. Not now, not ever. I'm the village chief's daughter and I will take care of you. Now you do your best to rest as much as you can, okay? Once I get back from work, I'll have a potion ready for you.&quot; Lisa asserted with a calm confident voice, patting the boy's head gently, moving on to replace all of his bandages, flipping his body over. She grimaced at the burn marks all over the boy's back, the sense of desperation getting even stronger in her veins while preparing to leave the tent.</p><p>Already in the short ten minutes that Lisa took to care for the boy, most of the tent had been emptied out, leaving only a few left, mostly those from Lisa's village who were still unable to acclimatize to the new life in the refugee camps, having been split up among the various tents.</p><p>&quot;Marah, can you watch over Selas? I'm going out to try to find a job.&quot; Lisa asked a elderly lady from the same village while she put on her workboots.</p><p>&quot;Of course, dear. Of course...&quot; The elderly lady had just woken up, but she already held a grim expression, one of that showed hope rapidly declining.</p><p>&quot;Today I'll get a potion for Selas, and we should be able to stay alive for longer.&quot; Lisa comforted Marah, before leaving the tent proper out into the blazing daylight and the crowded din of rows upon rows upon rows of makeshift tents that seemed to stretch out towards the horizon indefinitely, thousands of refugees like her fighting to survive in the high density and fast-paced race to earn a living wage. It was a stark contrast from the freedom of the village, Lisa now being a single cog in the machine.</p><p>Despite her external confidence, deep down Lisa only had worries after worries, not even sure if they would have enough water to last another week. Yet she buckled down, knowing that if she had time to worry, she had time to do something about it. She covered her head with a ragged piece of cloth, keeping her face hidden from the other refugees loitering about, some who stared her down as she made her way through the throng of people shambling to and fro, their mass only adding to the intense heat. With every tree and grass in the vicinity eradicated, there was hardly any shade to rest or take comfort in, something completely alien to the village-born Lisa.</p><p>As she left the tents, the environment began to change slightly, the usual broken fabric and flimsy supports now replaced with corrugated metal plates along with pieces of slag casted out from the factories used as foundations for rickety stalls and shops, sellers calling out prices and their wares while weak children lingered on the streets, begging for help or merely starving to death under the callous gazes of other equally starving refugees.</p><p>Lisa too couldn't afford the time to help each and every malnourished kid that she stepped past, knowing that other villagers were waiting for her, being one of the few remaining able-bodied ones. She quickened her steps, ignoring her exhaustion and focused putting one foot in front of the other, nothing else.</p><p>[Join the Versian Armed Knights today!] A arctech loudspeaker blared over the shuffling crowd of refugges, a light-thrower displaying onto a large black wall a faded glorious advertisement of soldiers marching in step and saluting in presidential parades. [Defend our home and our identity against those who wish to crush it! New recruits will receive fifteen tenars upon enlistment. No equipment? Harrison Industries will provide all fresh joiners with equipment, free of charge!]</p><p>Right below the advertisment was a sergeant already handling a long queue of refugees, many of them young boys and girls pushed to the edge by the harrowing conditions in the camp. Lisa didn't blame them - anyone who saw how much power the military wielded in the camp would have had half the mind to sign up. <em>Fifteen tenars, can I even earn that much in two weeks?</em></p><p>It took Lisa more than fifteen minutes to reach her destination: a square of sorts, where foremans screamed at the top of their lungs for openings that refugees clamored for, their voices carrying over the rumbling of military arctech wagons distributing supplies and children weaving through the crowd.</p><p>[Two spots left at Harrison Industries' Ocra Division! Free lodging, free meals, five tenars a week! Depart immediately! Must be able to lift a log!] A foreman shouted, even as he was already being swarmed by dozens of refugees.</p><p>&quot;Me! Me! Pick me, please!&quot; Desperate pleas and struggling cries could be heard in response, every refugee wanting to get out of the camp, a common occurrence nearly every hour of the week, each of them hoping to be selected.</p><p>[You! And you! Yes, you with the torn sleeves! Come on, wagon ain't gonna wait forever!]</p><p>&quot;Oh THANK THE GODDESS! THANK THE-&quot; The selected refugee was immediately pounced on by the others around, punches and kicks thrown at him on the ground while someone stuck a wrapped glass shard into his throat, carving right into his vocal cords and leaving him voiceless and twitching to death.</p><p>&quot;HEY, HEY, HEY! Break it up!&quot; The nearby Versian soldiers immediately moved in, dispersing the crowd and trying to snatch those who attacked the man, arresting them. But even as the attackers were dragged away, they had no regret, instead smiling to themselves and giving a thumbs up to the glass shard's wielder</p><p>[Looks like we got one spot left! You!] The foreman shouted into his arctech loudspeaker pointed to the man still holding the bloodied glass shard. [You look like you have some drive in you. Get in the wagon!]</p><p>Lisa sighed at the sight, and was about to ignore the commotion until she noticed who was the other worker selected by the foreman. She abandoned her original goal, hurriedly running to catch up with the worker and forcibly turning him around, revealing him to be the same violent villager who had punched the sergeant. &quot;Wez, you can't be serious! What are you doing, weren't you supposed to protect-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Protect what? Protect the village? What village?&quot; Wez grabbed Lisa's arm by the wrist and tossed her aside, his strength far beyond her as Lisa toppled to the ground. &quot;I told you to stay behind and defend what we owned, but look at us now. Scavenging and scrambling for bits and pieces. Where is the village to protect?&quot;</p><p>Lisa coughed while struggling to get to her feet, fueled by rage. &quot;You were born in the village, same as me. We grew up together, all of us, and here you are ditching us! Selas is still suffering from the burns because of what you did! &quot;</p><p>&quot;What did I do, other than try to protect the land our ancestors had?! You're the one who gave up, and listened to that smartass Jakub. Look where that got us!&quot; Wez motioned with his hands around at the swirling dust bowl kicked up by thousands of feet mingling and running in the square. &quot;And he and his wife left us for better lands in Tenar, ditching us! I don't hold any obligations to help a group who didn't listen to me.&quot;</p><p>[HEY YOU! IF YOU AIN'T COMING I'LL GET SOMEONE ELSE!] The foreman roared.</p><p>&quot;Farwell, Lisa.&quot; Wez turned and left towards a waiting arctech wagon, Lisa only able to watch as the original bonds of the village crumbled. Her mind began to ran wild as she calculated the loss of Wez, leaving only ten able-bodied villagers of adulthood that could potentially do work. <em>With him gone, that's one less ration card to...</em> Lisa caught herself mid-thought, realizing that she had reduced the villagers to mere numbers and statistics. <em>What have I become? Where is Jakub? Did he lie to us? Did he-</em></p><p>&quot;BITCH! Get the fuck out of the way! You're holding up the whole road!&quot; A wagon driver roared, frightening Lisa out of the street and into the side corners, where equally dismayed fresh refugees curled up into balls, crying their hearts out at the immense despair that they had been plunged into. Lisa nearly wanted to do the same, but knew that unlike Wez, she could not just ditch the others without it weighing on her conscience.</p><p>As she turned around to look in the square, she suddenly noticed a few people staring at her openly with disgust, before realizing that her face was no longer hidden. Scrambling to wrap her head around with the same ragged cloth once more, Lisa moved to her original goal, back at the center of the square.</p><p>Amidst the frantic chaos, She desperately sprinted from job board to foreman, trying to get a job within the camp itself. Many of the openings required posting outside of the camp or beyond Ocra, her options being limited. Soon she spotted a familar foreman, one that she had worked with before. Shoving her way to the front of the crowd gathering in front of his makeshift stage, she waved her hands frantically, trying to get his attention. &quot;Mister Hikub, it's me! it's me!&quot;</p><p>&quot;HALF A TENAR FOR A HAULER! HALF A TENAR - oh hello, dear, you're a bit late today. The job you had yesterday is gone now.&quot; Hikub spotted Lisa, lifting his tinted small circular glasses to get a better look.</p><p>Lisa's heart faltered for a bit, but she did not give up yet. &quot;It doesn't matter what job, as long as I can earn.&quot;</p><p>A wide grin sprouted on Hikub's face, his colorful robe heaving as he laughed. &quot;That's the spirit, girl! If you really want to earn, I have someone looking for a wife!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry too much, the suitor obviously would want a dinner date first, of course, and even if you don't pass his requirements, you'll still be paid.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm... I rather not.&quot;</p><p>The grin immediately evaporated from Hikub's face, his demeanour returning to the same haughty uncaring mood. &quot;Well then, out of our beautiful yet short friendship, I do have something for you. Take this token and tell the lady in flowers at Section 6A I sent you. One tenar a day.&quot;</p><p>A wooden token was sent sailing through the air, Lisa lunging out and grabbing it in her sweaty hands before others around her could react. She quickly scrambled out of the crowd , covering her face once more and disappearing into the ever increasing waves of refugees trying to get a job, brushing against others forcibly while a few tried to search for her, intent on snatching that job away.</p><p>She had no time to linger on Wez's departure any longer, focusing on what she could do now. She slunk past groups of famished kids harassing others for food, patrols of Versian soldiers snatching whatever snacks were available, as well as wealthy merchants organizing the next trade route, profiting off the desperation of the refugees as they hired them by the dozens off to a job beyond.</p><p>Section 6A was near the gates, filled to brim with Versian inspectors checking each and every wagon coming into the camp, traders hauling goods to and fro from deeper within Versia while temporary haulers waited for their next job, earning a mere pittance as they carried sacks far beyond their capabilities. <em>The lady in flowers...</em> Lise glanced around the messy street lined with excretions, dirt and a few stray animals before she noticed her new employer, a well-dressed lady with a dress seemingly made out of petals of varying colours, as though the flowers themselves had grown around her. If Lisa didn't know any better she might have mistaken her for a forest spirit instead if it were not for the lady smoking on an ornamental Euria pipe, blue smoke puffs circling and drifting around in a haze.</p><p>Lisa marched up confidently, handing the lady the wooden token from Hikub on outstretched palms. The lady barely budged, instead motioning with her hand towards two other girls. &quot;Join them. You'll get paid at dinnertime. I only have one rule: no talking. Ever. Got it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, of course, thank you, thank you!&quot; Lisa bowed multiple times, but the lady was hardly interested in her anymore, instead seemingly gazing off into the streets, seemingly looking for something. Lisa didn't care, quickly moving over to the two girls who were sat on the side of the street, weaving what looked like a sack. She was about to open her mouth to ask for guidance, when one of the girls raised her forefinger to her mouth, her eyes not leaving the sack on her thighs.</p><p><em>Right, no talking.</em> Lisa plopped down next to the girl, observing what the girl was doing, which seemed to be simply patching up holes in the sacks with newer fabric. There were nearly a thousand empty sacks piled up near each of the girls along with an additional sewing kit. Grabbing the needle expertly, she began to copy what the girls were doing, soon getting into the groove of it. Weirdly enough, the sacks each had uniform holes, though they were all seemingly at random.</p><p>Her niggling question on the origin of the holes were soon answered, as she watched three inspectors climb into the back of a trader's wagon, taking out what looked like an inspecting rod and piercing the sack from the top, extracting a sample of grain from the very center of the sack. The inspectors were thorough, checking each and every sack that the trader had till they were satisfied. &quot;Alright, you're clear. Move along.&quot;</p><p>Those inspected sacks were then passed to Lisa and the two girls, who repaired it while the trader paid the lady in flowers for the haulers and sack repair. Lisa's curiosity was temporarily satisfied, until the lady herself handed one of the girls a crate of small vials, their color dark yellow, clearly a potion ingredient. None of the haulers or girls under the employ of the lady said a word, simply moving about their jobs. Lisa watched the girl sow a single vial into the fabric of the sack, masking it with a newer fabric like a hidden pocket, while another group of boys slotted the vials into wooden crates, similarly hiding it as well.</p><p>The repaired sacks and crates returned to the trader, the trader paying the lady extra without exchanging a single word, far from the eyes of the inspector who were far too busy checking on the next trader wagon. Lisa had an inkling what was happening, but kept mum as she continued her work, moving along as her eyes never stopped wandering. <em>Where is she getting the vials from?</em> Lisa contemplated stealing the vials, knowing that it must be valuable. Yet the stable income was more important than whatever other thoughts she had, the image of Selas still suffering back in the tent continuously reminding her of what she needed to do.</p><p>As evening neared, the lady suddenly tapped Lisa on the back, handing her one tenar as promised by Hikub. &quot;Come back tomorrow. You don't need that token.&quot; The lady simply stated as if it was apparent, leaving Lisa overjoyed at finally having a potential stable job. She bowed to the lady with great respect, before leaving happily while stowing the sliver coin away in her pockets, making sure to hide it from anyone else looking at her.</p><p>Lisa rushed to a run-down shack, the wooden boards rotting from moisture as mold and mushrooms festered on it while the tattered fabric covering the entrance was stained in blood. Ignoring the dipilidated state of the shop, she entered, being immediately surrounded by three armed men, each wielding a makeshift handheld weapon and glaring her down. They too were refugees, but clearly well-fed and well-trained to beat anyone who tried to rob the shop.</p><p>&quot;I'm Lisa, I came here before, two days ago, to ask for a healing potion.&quot; Lisa raised her arms in a surrender, with one of the armed guards patting her down, his rough hands slightly grazing across her chest without apology. She bore the shame with a stern expression as she was checked for weapons.</p><p>Earning the armed guard grunt of approval, Lisa pushed past them, running up to a fat old man who languished on a reclining chair behind a wooden display cabinet, sleeping with his face covered by a newspaper. &quot;I'm here to buy a healing potion!&quot; Lisa rasped her fingers against the dark polished wood, jolting the old man awake with a scare.</p><p>&quot;Who- ah... it's you again.&quot; The old man yawned, stretching his arms. &quot;Finally got enough for the next dose?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Here, four tenars.&quot; Lisa proudly displayed four sliver coins in her hands, only to earn the old man's chuckle.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry, but it's six tenars now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?! You said it was four tenars two days ago, and I already bought one for four!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That was a first time discount.&quot; The old man picked up the same dark yellow vial from a shelf behind him, swirling it about. &quot;These things don't come cheap, and they are much harder to come across nowadays.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I....&quot; Lisa's confident demeanour melted away, her voice faltering as she struggled to find a way to convince him. &quot;Please, my friends are suffering.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. So I got a better deal for you. Two healing potions for one day's ration allowance.&quot;</p><p>Lisa nearly rejected the offer, but the healing potion was necessary to help the burn victims of the village heal. Yet it meant that she would not be able to eat nor drink for an entire day tomorrow, making it even tougher on her.</p><p>&quot;Time's ticking, my shop isn't open forever. Who knows? Maybe tomorrow the deal might be differ-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll do it. Here.&quot; Lisa was about to hand over her ration card when the old man shook his head.</p><p>&quot;The ration card is obviously tied to your name and identity. You're going to pick it up now and get it back to me in two hours before sunset.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the queue now is-&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you don't want the healing potions, there are plenty of others I can sell my wares too.&quot; The old man grinned. &quot;I don't need you, but you need me.&quot;</p><p>Lisa clenched her fist, but decided not to retort. There was no way she could fight against his armed guards as well, and she would be hunted down by the Versian soldiers if she tried to rob the shop. &quot;Fine. Don't you dare change the deal again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's up to me, not you. Better make a move, ration queue is getting longer.&quot;</p><p>She stormed out of the shop, leaving the old man smiling back in the potion store. The despair began to well up in her heart, but at least she still had a shot at survival. <em>I can go one day without food, and for the water I'll just try to scavenge it...</em></p><p>Sprinting towards the ration distribution center nearby barely made the queue any shorter, Lisa finding herself stuck behind a line of nearly three hundred other refugees snaking into a large white tent guarded by soldiers - wailing babies, desperate mothers, famished and maimed men returning from work, their skin peeling from the intense heat they suffered in the day. Nobody had the energy or time to talk to anyone, but Lisa had no time to queue up. She carefully hid her face, walking up near the front of the queue where a clearly starving lady was struggling to remain standing on two feet.</p><p>&quot;Two tenars, let me take your spot.&quot; Lisa offered the lady quietly, but the lady only glowered at her with bloodshot eyes, shaking her head vigorously. &quot;Three tenars, please I need the rations faster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I've been in queue for more than four hours now!&quot; The starving lady spat, her voice hoarse from the lack of water.</p><p>&quot;Three tenars can buy you three meals!&quot; Lisa urged.</p><p>&quot;You think I'm an idiot? If others see you passing that much money to me, I'll be jumped!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Four tenars.&quot;</p><p>The lady didn't respond for a while, her gaunt face glancing around quickly before hurriedly motioning to Lisa with a taut palm. Lisa quickly handed the four sliver coins over, the lady immediately leaving the queue and letting her take her spot with no additional fuss, third from the front.</p><p>Ignoring the grumbles and stares aimed at her, Lisa waited with bated breath, as it came to her turn, facing three Versian soldiers manning a simple booth, behind which was stocked with the very same sacks of grain and crates she had repaired in the day, other refugees worker in the back packing them into smaller satchels.</p><p>&quot;Ration card? Remove your hood, please.&quot; The soldier extended a hand, Lisa passing over her card, an empty flask and a small satchel before reluctantly removing the cloth covering her head. Immediately glares of disgust latched onto her from the soldiers, but they did not say anything, merely passing the satchels on to the refugees workers who began to pack grain and water into the satchel and flask respectively.</p><p>Lisa quickly wrapped her head again in cloth, the filled satchel and water handed back to her. However, as soon as she felt the weight of it, she knew that something was clearly wrong. &quot;Uhm, sir... this doesn't seem to be the right ration size?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm? We're reducing the rations sizes.&quot; The soldier in charge stated nonchalantly. &quot;You're holding up the queue. Move.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I saw the man in front of me receive a full flask and satchel. This is only three-quarters-&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you're not going to move, this will be considered as obstruction. And know this - half-breeds aren't treated well in the labor camps.&quot; The soldier glared at Lisa.</p><p>A fiery rage began to well up in Lisa's chest at the clear mistreatment, but she could also feel the angry stares of the refugees queuing up behind, clearly also wanting her to move away as soon as possible. Resigning to her fate, Lisa left the ration distribution center with only three-quarters of a ration, wondering if the old man at the potion store would be still willing to at least pass her one healing potion at the minimum. She had her doubts, but still she had to try, her pace picking up once again, moving towards the potion store.</p><p>However, as soon as she turned the corner, a blunt pipe slammed right into her forehead, the force sending her tumbling onto the ground, disorientating while her mouth was filled with the taste of dirt and soot. She tried to flail her arms to fend off whoever attacked her, her eyes finally noticing that it was the starving lady she had given four tenars too. Lisa struggled to get to her feet, but the concussion had her head ringing non-stop, allowing the starving lady to grab her flask of water.</p><p>Lisa summoned whatever conscious strength she had and clinged onto her satchel of grain as tight as she could, kicking the lady away. The lady didn't linger around, immediately sprinting off into the myriad of alleys with the stolen flask of water. &quot;YOU!&quot; Lisa roared in pain, but there was nothing she could do, still left groaning on the floor.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, her fists clenched tightly as she forced herself to stand, before stumbling towards the potion store, clear trickles of blood leaking down her forehead. Other refugees had clearly seen the attack, but no one lent a hand, not wanting to be involved. Some of them even began to follow Lisa, hoping to catch her off-guard if she ever let slip her guard.</p><p>Clutching her satchel to her body as tightly as she could, she made it back to the potion store, the armed guards astonished at the blood and dust coating Lisa from the sudden struggle. The old man on the other hand hardly raised an eyebrow even as Lisa tossed the grain satchel towards him.</p><p>&quot;And the water?&quot; The old man asked before noticing the weight of the satchel. &quot;This is only half of the ration.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stolen.&quot; Lisa hardly had any energy left to speak, her breathing ragged as she tried to wipe some of the blood off with her head cloth.</p><p>The old man sighed, thinking about what to do next before finally deciding to hand Lisa a dark yellow potion. &quot;Here. You only get one because-&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's half. I know.&quot; Lisa snatched the potion out of his hands, limping out of the store without another word. All of her hate and rage at her current scenario began to swirl in her mind non-stop, the throbbing blood thumping in her ears as the adrenaline began to build. When she finally returned to her allocated tent, she noticed that Selas had been left alone, the other villagers conspicuously missing. A fire began to burn in her soul, her fist clenched in anger until she heard Marah's distinctive voice coming out from another tent, followed by shouts and sounds of a struggle.</p><p>Lisa moved over as quick as she could, only to see the villagers along with Marah and other strangers holding down another burn victim, who was fighting as hard as he could to break free. &quot;What's, what's going on?!&quot; Lisa stared in confusion at the frothing mouth of the burn victim, as if he had gone feral. &quot;I, I have a healing potion here!&quot; She raised the potion she bought in the air, the potion suddenly spurring the burn victim to push even harder, biting and snapping at any arm holding him down.</p><p>Marah swivelled to look at her, but instead of an answer, Lisa only got angry stares as an unknown stranger approached her. &quot;I heard you were the one who bought the healing potions for him two days ago.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's right.&quot; Lisa nodded with a slight mix of apprehension, afraid of what was about to come.</p><p>&quot;Well, the potions are a dud. They have been diluted greatly and have been dosed with Euria Extract. He's undergoing withdrawal right now.&quot;</p><p>Lisa's heart plummeted. &quot;Wh-what..? No, but, the old man told me it would take a few days to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Healing potions should heal within minutes, not days. Anything else is a diluted form. Whoever sold you the potion is planning on you being a repeat customer.&quot;</p><p>Lisa's words were stuck in her throat for a while, as her mind frantically tried to find a way out, a way to reverse what she had done. &quot;But I've spent more than four tenars and rations on it, I... you must be an alchemist as well, right? You must know how to fix this!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I... I was just a village alchemist, nothing special. But for what you're asking, It's not going to be cheap. I can make a healing potion from scratch but I'll need the raw ingredients. Poair Leaves, Griess Powder namely. I suspect with the demand in the refugee camp for such herbs, a single potion might cost about twenty tenars.&quot;</p><p>The burn victim finally calmed down, while Lisa returned to her own tent, distraught at what she had just wasted, sitting next to the sleeping Selas. <em>Twenty tenars, that's twenty days!</em> Her thoughts were interrupted by a groan from Selas, Lisa immediately bending over and checking his wounds. There were signs of slow regeneration, but it was far too slow, Selas' face still in agony at the jolting pain he felt from the scars.</p><p>&quot;Lisa... did you get it...?&quot; Selas asked, his voice laced with hope.</p><p>&quot;I... I'm still working on it. You can count on me, just rest as much as you can. I... I'll handle it. We'll get you back to your usual self in no time.&quot; Lisa's wavering voice tried to comfort Selas, but her tears already began to leak from the corner of her eyes as she changed Selas's bandages once more.</p><p>As Selas began to drift back to sleep, Lisa resolved herself, heading back out into the center of the refugee camp once more. Even at night, the central square was still filled to the brim with refugees, there being work to be done even at night. Trench diggers and logistical haulers were all recruited for the improvements on Ocra's fortifications, while soldiers off-duty searched for a fun night out. Lisa on the other hand, was searching for yet another lifeline out, the story of her days unchanging.</p><p>She found Hikub still at the same spot, handling job allocations and collecting a good commission for his efforts inside his own little converted wagon that was basically a permanent office with a quaint little table, guarded by two hired refugees. Hikub noticed the disheveled Lisa from afar, raising his eyebrows. &quot;Didn't expect you to see you at night, dear. If you don't rest well before tomorrow, it would be tough for you to - you're bleeding.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm here for that dinner date you mentioned. But I want thirty tenars.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh? Daring, are we?&quot; Hikub smiled, his gloved hands clapsing each other as he rested against a table. &quot;I'm sorry, but thirty is beyond what I can offer. Best I can do is twenty, hows that? Why do you need that much anyway?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Twenty tenars, deal.&quot; Lisa ignored the prying question. &quot;I need it now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm, we'll need to doll you up a little though. We'll need to cover that mark of yours.&quot; Hikub rose from his chair, motioning for Lisa to follow him to a nearby shack, where the dense scent of Euria smoke hung low around the dim flickering arctech lantern, a luxury that many refugees did not have. Lisa glared warily at the obviously intoxicated men and woman lying on mats, smoking away as much as they could with dreamy smiles on their faces.</p><p>Lisa found herself attended to by two other girls, who stripped her and wiped the blood off her forehead, applying shoddy caked makeup and a simple dress, replacing her haggard look with a homely one. The bulk of the makeup was lathed onto her head after removing the cloth covering it. &quot;Beautiful.&quot; Hikub approved. As soon as Lisa was ready, she found herself whisked away in a wagon, brought to an entirely different part of the refugee camp that she had never been to before. Drunkards and raucous laughter reigned supreme in the nightlife, each shack seemingly offering alcohol and Euria seeds to Versian soldiers and traders alike. The wagon soon lurched to a halt outside what seemed to be a pub of sorts, a ear-shattering din continously emitting from inside.</p><p>&quot;Don't get cold feet dear. You need the money, so you do what you got to do.&quot; Hikub reminded as Lisa left the wagon with him, following him into the blinding lights beyond the doorway. Instead of a pub, it was a full blown gambling den, filled to the brim with soldiers risking their daily wages away in the hopes of striking it rich. Dice, cards, cups and coinflips were all played on various tables, joyous laughter or cries of defeat erupting everywhere all at once, disorientating Lisa while Hikub led her to a table.</p><p>&quot;Officer, your requested date.&quot; Hikub bowed respectfully to a Versian officer still dressed in uniform, sipping on a glass of whiskey as he sat at a table of dice. The officer examined Lisa, looking her up and down, before nodding slightly. &quot;She'll do.&quot; A pouch of money holding an unimaginable amount of tenars was passed to Hikub, a wide smile on his face as he left Lisa as quickly as he had arrived.</p><p>Lisa was about to shout after Hikub for her tenars, but Hikub had already disappeared into the crowd of gamblers. Already Lisa found herself cornered by the stares of Versian soldiers, all of whom glared at her, clearly indicating for her to sit down next to the officer. She gingerly sat down, the slightly drunk officer slinging his sweaty arms around her shoulders and dragging her closer. &quot;High or low?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The dices. High or low?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm... High?&quot;</p><p>The officer tossed a larger golden coin, Lisa's eyes bulging at the money being tossed around on the table as the other sergeants and corporals also tossed equal amounts. <em>That's... that's a hundred tenars!</em> The table's dice dealer rolled the dice into a cup expertly, shaking it violently before slamming it onto the table, removing the cup to reveal a high number.</p><p>Immediately, the officer had a wide grin on his face, collecting his winnings. &quot;Get this lady a special drink, she might be my lucky star today. For your efforts, dear.&quot; The officer placed ten sliver coins in front of her, Lisa involuntarily gulping at what had just been offered to her. <em>Maybe... maybe this isn't so bad after all.</em></p><p>A waiter served her and the officer a shot glass of whiskey, the officer raising it in a toast to the others. &quot;Time to win the night!&quot; He roared, his soldiers under his command cheering back in response. Lisa too raised her glass, drinking along with them. However, as soon as the whiskey hit her throat, she could already feel something was wrong with the drink.</p><p>Her vision began to fade in and out, as her muscles slowly became stiffer, her eyes noticing her veins starting to turn a little purple. She tried to scream in panic, but her vocal cords were sluggish, only letting out a groan to earn the officer's attention. &quot;Are you okay, my lady? Do you need a rest?&quot;</p><p>Lisa couldn't speak, the officer's face slightly worried as he tried to tap Lisa's pulse on her wrist. &quot;Sorry boys, have to take care of the lady.&quot; Against her will, her body was dragged upstairs to a empty bedroom, the guarding soldiers hardly blinking at the sight of Lisa being carried by the officer. &quot;No one comes in or out until I'm done.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; The soldiers saluted, Lisa's heart panicking as she strained herself, trying to move even just her finger. Instead, she could not control her body, the officer dumping her onto a rickety bed while he began to strip his uniform and his belt that holstered his handgun, placing them on the ground, his eyes barely looking at her as anything more than a simple product to be used.</p><p>She tried to close her eyes, but she couldn't, only able to watch in horror as her dress as it was ripped apart forcibly, her mind spiralling into despair. Nearly everything in the refugee camp had worked against her, her own naivety exploited without her knowledge. Even though she could not shut her eyes, she began to accept her fate, preparing to watch what was to come.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud scream and gun pellets erupted from the corridor outside the room, resulting in more screams and shrieks erupting from the lower floor, the officer stopping mid-action. Without saying a word, the officer immediately grabbed the handgun from the belt on the ground, aiming it at the door. &quot;Sergeant Moras?! What's going on out there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, someone is atta-&quot; The sergeant's voice was cut out by the sound of scraping metal against bone, a loud thud indicating a body collapsing in the corridor. The officer's face paled as he gripped his handgun's handle tightly, aiming at the door.</p><p>Before he could react, the door was blasted off its hinge, kicked with such force that the door slammed right into him, the handgun sailing through the air while his body was sent tumbling onto the ground, his head crashing against the floor. The moment the officer tried to recover, a man was already ontop of him, the sole of his boots stomping down onto his arm and crushing the bone deeply, a scream of pain leaving the officer's mouth.</p><p>The officer tried to raise his other hand to push the man's foot off of his pinned arm, but the man instead wielded a makeshift stick up high, one laced with sharp glass shards trickling with blood. In a brutal downward swing he grated deep into the officer's arm, the officer yelling even harder. &quot;ARGHHHH! YOU! Don't you know I am an Versian officer-&quot;</p><p>But the man did not relent on his attack, slamming the modified stick down again and again onto the officer, his pleas and words slowly muffled by the blood gushing out from his wounds, smothering his mouth. Each violent blow tore and ripped out more of the officer's flesh, flaying him naked and disfiguring his face. Soon, the officer's hand collapsed to the floor, lifeless as the man continued pounding the dead body before finally being satisfied.</p><p>The man glanced at Lisa, Lisa immediately recoiling from the blood that covered his's demonic expression as he approached closer, checking Lisa's arms and the purple veins. Pulling out an arctech radio in his belt, the man began to speak with a familiar voice. &quot;Sasha, I found her. I need a antidote ready when I get back.&quot;</p><p><em>Culo!? Since when he was this strong?</em> Lisa wanted to scream with joy, but she could not move an inch. Culo smiled at her as he wrapped her up in the bedsheet, protecting her modesty while lifting her onto her shoulders, his body stronger than ever.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry, Lisa. This time, I'll save the village.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 102 - Insurgency</strong></p><p>[&quot;The sovereignty of the Versian nation is at stake! Join your fellow comrades in arms, and fight for freedom and representation away from the tyranny of the Emperor!&quot;] The same old announcement blared out into the bustling refugee camp, accompanied by the slow rumbling tremors while the military arctech wagon rattled across the dusty street, its exhaust billowing plumes of dust against cowering refugees who hid their faces from the escorting soldiers.</p><p>Lisa groaned, her eyelids heavy as she found herself lying flat on a thatched sheet in the middle of what seemed to be a cramped abandoned shop of sorts, empty pots and jugs dangling from threads hooked to deformed bedframes suspended in the ceiling. Specks of light flickered in through the perforated canopy above, the air filled with the usual stench of muddy earth and decay. She no longer worn the ripped dress which she had been raped in, instead covered by a thick blanket weaved from multiple coarse fabrics, one she recognized to be used for sacks. She tried to move her right arm, but it was as if she was laden with lead in her veins, the muscles sluggish.</p><p>A familiar hand rested on her arm, gripping it firmly. Lisa could feel the callouses in its palm rubbing coarsely against her wrist. &quot;Don't move, the more you exert, the more the effects will linger in your body.&quot;</p><p>&quot;C-Culo...&quot; Lisa found her voice cracking, her throat parched as though she had just traversed a vast desert before. &quot;When did you return?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Two weeks ago.&quot; Culo gently put the lid of a flask against her lips, letting her sip carefully. &quot;I only heard recently that you guys were at the refugee camp. What happened to the village?&quot;</p><p>Lisa tried to respond, but instead began to choke on the water, though she did her best to keep in it instead of letting it spill out of her mouth. Water was precious here, and the sight of Lisa struggle to save every drop made Culo's heart plummet.</p><p>&quot;We're going to have to wait here for a bit, let the heat die out before we move. Probably till nighttime, when there are less soldiers patrolling.&quot; Culo explained while he peered through a crack between the corrugated metal walls of the abandoned shop, eyeing the patrolling soldiers harassing refugees nearby.</p><p>Lisa swallowed hard, letting out a relaxed sigh. &quot;The village... we were attacked, our houses burnt from artillery fire.&quot;</p><p>Culo's eyes narrowed in suspicion while he still kept watch. &quot;Artillery fire? Who told you that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There was a Versian squad who came to us, they wanted us to evacuate-&quot; Lisa's heart skipped a beat as she suddenly saw Culo's angry face swivelling to glare at her.</p><p>&quot;That's a lie, the Versian soldiers just wanted to pillage you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But we did get bombed later in the day, just as they predicte-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course it's just as they predicted.&quot; Culo spat with a fiery rage boiling in his chest. &quot;They were the ones who bombed you! The military exercise isn't anywhere near enough to be able to hit the village.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? How do you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look at the refugees streaming into this camp. All of them have the same story - attacked by Raktor soldiers, bombed by artillery fire. Thousands of them all across the region of Ocra. Weird, huh, that there's so many skirmishes happening but the Versian army is still 'mobilising'. What a coincidence.&quot;</p><p>It was a bit hard for Lisa to swallow, but after all of the terrible things that has happened to her in the refugee camp, she was more than inclined to believe Culo. It was far worse to imagine that it was the result of sheer incompetence that her life had fallen to such a stage. However, she suddenly recalled something important. &quot;Culo, your brother, he was hired by Harrison Industries. He was on a wagon to Tenar!&quot;</p><p>Culo stared blankly at Lisa, stunned for a moment before letting out an exasperated sigh. &quot;... shit.&quot; He walked back towards a rickety old chair, slumping down into it. &quot;I knew this would happen. What did they promise him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wasn't there for the meeting, but he said he'll try to get us balloted into Tenar...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Another lie.&quot; Culo waved his hands dismissively. &quot;This whole refugee camp, the skirmishes, the attacks, it's all a ploy to drive people into here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But why? Why would anyone do this? Many of us are suffering here for no reason at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is exactly that suffering that is being exploited. When times are desperate, people will cling onto anything. Anything that can save them. That can feed them. In events like this, the simplest answer to who would have done it, is by seeing who profits the most from it.&quot;</p><p>Lisa watched as another wagon rolled past the abandoned shop through the boarded up windows, the side of the wagon plastered with big letters. &quot;Harrison Industries. Why is the government not stopping them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The new acting president most likely must be working with Harrison.&quot; Culo muttered as he pulled out a unfamiliar rifle from behind his chair, checking its barrel to make sure it was all clean. &quot;What about the rest of the village? Where are they?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are separated into different sections. Selas and Marah are with me, but Selas had been burnt badly by the attack. I tried to buy some healing potions for him-&quot;</p><p>&quot;But they were laced with addictive Euria.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How did you know-&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're the ones smuggling them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We...?&quot; Lisa mumbled before she realized what Culo had just said, fury rising in her body as she struggled to get up. &quot;You.... you're the ones who made everything worse!&quot; She whispered angrily, still cognisant of their current situation.</p><p>&quot;Lisa, you need to rest-&quot; Culo got off his chair and tried to coax Lisa back into lying down, but she swiped off Culo's arm fiercely.</p><p>&quot;How can I rest when you are the ones actively hurting the refugees!? Your addictive potions are causing everyone to spiral even harder into poverty and depression!&quot; Lisa tried to smack Culo on the cheek, but Culo caught her wrist mid-air, stopping her weakened arm easily.</p><p>&quot;Firstly, I don't sell to the refugees directly. I don't control who sells what. I'm not the police, the military, or the government. I'm just another man, another face in the camp. And as of this stage, morals be damned if we want to achieve what we were sent here to do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who is this 'we' you keep talking about?! Who twisted you, Culo? You used to be -&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't like who I used to be!&quot; Culo fumed in a sharp hushed voice, before relaxing a little. &quot;I was weak. Naive. Blind to how the world works. In this life, if you don't fight for what you deserve, you will never get it. Have you not learnt from everything that has happened to you?! The treatment of us half-breeds, the mark they seared into your forehead? Morals won't save you from being raped. Only strength, money and power will.&quot;</p><p>Lisa could stare at Culo's face in horror. &quot;Well the whole reason I was in that position was because of that same potions!&quot; She snatched her wrist away from Culo's grasp, retreating under the blanket in anger.</p><p>Culo didn't linger too long, returning to his chair and checking his rifle and other weapons available to him. The silence between the two of them reigned for the better part of an hour, the sounds of fights over rations and lamenting of mothers over dying children washing over the abandoned stall. As time passed, Lisa kept replaying the traumatic scene of last night, betrayed by Hikub and sold off as just another body to be raped, the memories vivid even as she closed her eyes, trying to sleep. Her stomach soon began to rumble, famished from having not eaten anything at all, her rations having been stolen and sold off as well.</p><p>A tapping sound and the smell of braised meat caught Lisa's attention, pulling her out of her depressive spiral. She turned to see Culo cracking open a can of preserved beef, pouring it onto a half cracked bowl and carrying it towards her. Sitting up relcutantly while still clutching the coarse blanket close to her body, she finally broke the silence. &quot;I want to go back. There’s other villagers who still need our help.”</p><p>“If you follow me back to my hideout, I can get you the money and potions needed to-“</p><p>“I don’t want anything from you!” Lisa suddenly burst out again. “Not from you, not anymore! I never thought someone could change that fast, but you have proven me wrong. Let me go back, now!”</p><p>“It’s not safe now, the whole camp is crawling with patrols trying to find us!”</p><p>“I don’t care! I have nothing to do with whatever self-absorbed fantasy you have. If anything, you’re just as bad as the Versian officer, just one side of the problem!” Lisa slapped the bowl of beef out of Culo’s hand, spiraling out and smashing onto the floor, the food wasted. “Don’t think that just because I’m in shit means that I will turn to crime! I have a village to protect, and I have morals. I can see you have neither.” </p><p>“You have no idea what you’re saying – you’re stuck in the past. You really think these kind of morals will help you to survive?!” Culo shot back, infuriated by Lisa wasting the food. “You going back to the villagers won’t solve the root cause of the problem!”</p><p>“If I have to be complicit with drug smuggling and stealing, then maybe you are also part of the problem! LET ME GO!” Lisa shouted angrily, uncaring of the passing refugees who could hear their muffled conversation.</p><p>“Fine! But don’t you blame me if shit goes sideways again – you’ve made your choice!” Culo snapped, handing over a pile of shabby stained clothes. Lisa snatched a few, hurriedly changing while Culo fumed in a corner, unable to come to terms with Lisa’s stubbornness. Soon, Lisa was dressed in a garment not unlike the other refugees, leaving the shack without so much as a goodbye to Culo. </p><p>Re-entering the blistering heat on the open streets, each step had the soles of her feet burning from the rough gravel and soil as she focused on returning back to her village tents. It took another ten minutes, with a few close calls with Versian patrols clearly looking for her, asking refugees. “Bounty, one hundred tenars for this lady and her lover!” A Versian conscript shouted, holding up a painted sketch of her and Culo, the refugees all alerted to the huge sum of money offered. </p><p><em>Shit! </em>Lisa knew she needed to keep low, Culo’s words echoing in her head. <em>No, I won’t listen to a drug peddler! Not when he’s part of the reason why we’re suffering now!</em> Lisa slinked her way back towards the tent, finally reaching where her belongings were, Marah stirring awake from Lisa’s hectic entry. “Whu…  where the hell have you been all night?! I’ve been taking care of Selas this entire time!” Marah accused. “Did you get the money to pay the alchemist?!”</p><p>“Uhh…” Lisa didn’t know what to say, this being the second time she had returned emptyhanded. Her heart clenched with guilt and shame, as though every time she left this tent, something terrible were to happen. </p><p>“What kind of village chief are you?!” The obviously sleep-deprived Marah snapped at her, furious. “Utterly useless – we are suffering here while you are running around, playing!”</p><p>“I wasn’t playing, I was trying to get money!”</p><p>“And?! Where’s the money?”</p><p>“I… I don’t have it.” Lisa sat down, crestfallen. “I tried, Marah. I really tried…. I tried…” Lisa broke down, tears trickling down her cheeks as she grabbed Selas’ thin hand, holding up to her chest and clutching it tightly. “I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I couldn’t…”</p><p>Marah let out an exasperated sigh. “Looks like we have to find another way. I’ll go to the other tent and ask around for solutions. Now stop grabbing Selas’s hand otherwise you’ll wake him… what’s wrong?” Marah noticing Lisa’s eyes widening as Lisa grabbed Selas’s wrist, measuring his pulse and putting her finger at Selas’s nose. </p><p>“Selas… Selas is not breathing!” Lisa frantically shook Selas’s shoulder, before Marah shoved her out of the way, immediately clasping both of her burly hands over Selas’ chest and pumping regularly, trying to resituate Selas to no avail. The din of the refugee camp drowned out the looming silence as Lisa watched on in horror, Selas’s lifeless body already losing its color. </p><p>Eventually, after five harrowing minutes, Marah gave up, exhausted while Lisa tried her best too to revive him. “Maybe, maybe the alchemist can do something! He must be able to do something!” Lisa barely eked out the words while crying non-stop both at his death and her incompetence, until Marah slapped her on the cheek. </p><p>“Stop whining! You’re making everything harder in this accursed camp! Wasn’t it you who suggest for us to come to this camp in the first place, you and that stupid Jakub who had abandoned us!”</p><p>“He did not abandon us, he’s trying his best to secure a slot for us in Tenar. It just takes time-“</p><p>“And when is Selas getting his turn?! Even the aid promised to us has not arrived! If you want to just sit here and cry like a girl, be my guest. But I’m going to solve our situation, by hook or crook!” Marah snapped, storming out of the tent and leaving Lisa with the dead Selas. </p><p>Lisa recalled her last conversation with Selas, promising him that there would be help and hope. <em>But I failed. Nothing works. I tried… </em>She curled up into a ball next to Selas, sniffling and wallowing in her own despair. It wasn’t until a few minutes later that an intrusive thought entered her mind. <em>Should I have joined Culo?</em></p><p>She immediately rejected the notion. <em>Selas’ death is partly his fault!</em> Yet even now Lisa found that a stretch – Culo was not the one who had burnt the village nor forced them to move to the refugee camp. <em>It’s okay, as long as we stick together, we’ll get through anything. We can survive as a village-</em></p><p>“Bounty, one hundred tenars for this lady and her lover!” The same call could now be heard approaching closer to the tents, Lisa’s heart stiffening as she scrambled to hide. She could hear the soldiers entering the tents one by one to search for them, but Lisa had nowhere to mask herself. <em>Maybe I should run, I should run before the rest get implicated…</em></p><p>The minutes seemed to last an eternity, as the sound of boots getting closer and closer seemed to be never-ending, always approaching. Lisa was prepared to flee the tent through the otherside by crawling under the fabric. Just as a soldier began to grab the opening of the tent, she suddenly heard Marah’s voice calling the soldiers, causing them to turn their heads. “Who are you looking for?”</p><p>Lisa’s heart swelled with gratitude, knowing Marah was trying to distract the soldiers away from her tent. <em>Oh thank the Goddess, thank you Marah-</em></p><p>“I know her, I know her! She’s in the tent, dressed in a rucksack with long hair! That damn halfbreed will try to escape from behind the tent!” Marah suddenly shouted. “I want the hundred tenars!”</p><p>Lisa did not have time to contend with the sudden betrayal of the very same villagers she had worked so hard to support, the soldiers bursting into the tent and rushing at her. With barely any strength left, having not even eaten since the day before, Lisa’s struggle was futile, only able to watch as the soldiers mercilessly kicked the dead Selas’s body out of the way, grabbing and restraining her. Two soldiers hoisted her out into the open, the other villagers and Marah all gathered around the edges of their tents, while Lisa was forced to kneel in front of a Versian sergeant. </p><p>“So you’re the bitch who killed our officer! You think you can just slip away like this, huh? The entire camp is under our control!” The sergeant sneered and grabbed Lisa by her hair, yanking it upwards as the other soldiers laughed. “It’s a shame he died for such a bitch, but at least he left some fun for the rest of us, huh? You, give that lady the hundred tenars.”</p><p>The ordered soldier nodded, grabbing a pouch and tossing the coins towards the other villagers, who immediately dived and groveled on the ground, all dignity lost as they scrambled and scuffled with each other for every little coin, once long-time friends throwing fists and kicks to survive. Even Marah too shoved and pushed, grabbing as many as she could on the ground while the soldiers laughed at the miserable sight. “That’s right, halfbreeds, fight!”</p><p>Lisa’s mind was now beyond broken as she watched her villagers fight each other, torn apart by simple desperation and survival. It was too hard for her to acceptance the sudden betrayal by Marah, leaving her out to dry.  <em>Was I the only stupid one who believed in morals and support? How could I be so naïve…. </em>Lisa’s head hung low, defeated with any sense of belief and ideal that lingered in her dissipating. </p><p>“Grab her back to the barracks! Tie her up in the brig, we’ll rotate hours.” The sergeant grinned, having two soldiers haul her off through the streets, Lisa’s feet dragging and being cut up by the rough stones left on the side of the street. Her forehead bore the mark of a halfbreed; one afforded to those staying near the border of Ocra and Raktor, earning her jeers and taunts even from the other equally desperate refugees. Each yell and thrown stone that hit her head only beat the lesson deeper into her soul, her mind nearly going blank as she was hauled through the camp. Only a single thought rested in her mind as she stared up to the sky, blood on the forehead masking her vision as she held a self-deprecating smile at the irony of it all. <em>Culo, how could I have been so stupid? What did we do to deserve this at all?</em></p><p>As if in response to her internal cry for help, she suddenly felt one of her arms released, the soldier that had been carrying her collapsing onto the ground with a pained scream, a pellet having torn through the sinews of his thigh, rupturing the bone into sharp fragments that caused him to keel over. Lisa was dropped unceremoniously onto the ground as the remaining soldier tried to grab his slung rifle, only for a shadow to suddenly appear from within the crowd of now scattering refugees, lunging out with a knife that lodged deep into the ribs of the remaining soldier. </p><p>Before Lisa could even register what was happening, the shadow grabbed her, hoisting her up and sprinting as hard as he could. The view was a complete blur, Lisa watching the camp blaze past her in complete disorientation. They finally came to a stop near a tight alleyway, far from the prying eyes of other refugees. A cool liquid was poured over Lisa’s face, healing her quickly and enough for her to get her bearings and finally recognize who it was. <em>Culo!</em> Without saying a word, Lisa hugged him as tight as she could for a minute, only silence as Culo returned the hug. </p><p>“I’m always here for you, Lisa. You’re not alone.” Culo murmured into Lisa’s ears as they continued to hug. “Not even if the others betray you.”</p><p>Lisa sniffled and pushed Culo away, rubbing off the snot that was trickling down her nose. “Just… just get me somewhere safe. I don’t care where anymore.” </p><p>Culo nodded, helping Lisa up as they weaved through the myriad of haphazard tents and makeshift buildings, losing any patrolling soldiers before reaching near the walls of Ocra. The refugee camp had already melded against the walls of Ocra, only separated by a large trench filled with barbed wire to prevent refugees from scaling the walls.</p><p>Instead of navigating through the barbed wire for all the city guards to see, Culo instead diverted towards what seemed like an outhouse, the smell of excretion pooling in a shallow hole forcing Lisa to pinch her nose tight. Culo ignored the stench, going around to the back of the outhouse where there was a small little trapdoor, unlatching it to reveal a ladder that descended into an unknown depth.</p><p>&quot;After you.&quot; Culo motioned, closing the lid after Lisa had clambered down the ladder. She found herself in a tight tunnel that could barely fit one person's shoulder width, forcing her to squeeze through in the pitch black darkness.</p><p>While she groped her way into the darkness, her hands suddenly knocked against something clearly metallic, a door blocking her path. The door opened to reveal two rifle barrels pointed right at her face, wielded by what seemed to be young female recruits nearly the same age as Lisa. Lisa let out a yelp in fear, almost doubling back into Culo directly.</p><p>&quot;It's me, stand down. Where's Sasha?&quot; Culo revealed himself, sticking his head beyond Lisa's shoulders.</p><p>&quot;What's the code?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Geraldine, it's me, Culo, I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's the code?!&quot; The female recruit jabbed the barrel towards the two of them.</p><p>&quot;By day she smiles, by night she smites.&quot;</p><p>The two female recruits finally let down their guards, extending their hands to help Lisa out of the tunnel into a brightly lit room carved underground, the only furnishing being the tunnel's trapdoor, a single exit door, and the three arctech lanterns above. &quot;Sasha's waiting in the command room. You got a lot of fucking explaining to do,&quot; Geraldine answered without emotion, though she scrutinized Lisa from head to toe. &quot;Is this your girlfriend?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Culo and Lisa exclaimed in unison.</p><p>&quot;Yea, must be.&quot; Geraldine seemed self-satisfied with the answer. &quot;Only reason why you would kill an officer this blatantly. Not to mention two more soldiers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Urgh....&quot; Culo groaned, dragging Lisa away from the two gossiping female recruits. He swung the exit door open, revealing a small tavern of sorts, the tables, and chairs filled to the brim with similar recruits, all of whom wielded rifles slung to their bodies. Lisa gulped instinctively as they locked eyes with hers, Culo hurriedly dragging her through the tavern before reaching an inconspicuous door, entering the command room.</p><p>Lisa had already been surprised at the amount of people living underground, though she was far more shocked at the quality of the food and drinks they had. What surprised her even more was the command room, which was dominated by a large map of Versia placed on a stone table, marked by squiggly handwriting over almost all major cities and towns.</p><p>While Lisa was gazing at the map, Culo himself was nervous, his gaze catching that of Sasha who's elbows were resting on the table, her hands clasped as she glowered at him, her mood clear as day. Culo’s original confidence that was on full display before Lisa melted away entirely in front of Sasha, who was the clear head in charge of the forward operation in Ocra.</p><p>&quot;Look, I know what I did was wrong...&quot; Culo began, but Sasha didn't respond, merely holding up two fingers that immediately made Culo flustered, far from the confident Culo that Lisa had witnessed over the last few hours. &quot;Two... days? Sorry, I can't interpret your signs and expression like Merissa can, I- two weeks?! He's coming in two weeks?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, who's coming in two weeks?&quot; Lisa blurted out without thinking, the glare of Sasha now resting on her directly. Culo immediately stepped in between the two of them, smiling nervously.</p><p>&quot;Sasha, meet Lisa, my current village chief. She has good potential to be a leader, and with her she can organize and recruit more people. She’s aligned with us, I swear, I knew her all my life. I'll make killing that officer worth it.&quot;</p><p>The intensity of Sasha's glare weakened, as she got up from her seat, eyeing Lisa from all angles. Picking up a pen, Sasha scribbled quickly onto a piece of paper, handing it over to Lisa, who read it quickly.</p><p><em>Do you seek strength, or righteousness?</em></p><p>&quot;Say ye-&quot; Culo's words were instantly cut off by Sasha, who shoved him aside, forcing Lisa to answer on her own accord.</p><p>&quot;I don't want strength for strength alone. I want both. I want the strength to be righteous. I want the strength to force others to be righteous!&quot; Lisa replied with determination, locking eyes with Sasha for a good few moments until Sasha nodded in response, motioning to Culo.</p><p>&quot;Right, I'll get Geraldine to train her. Thank you, Sasha. And no, she's not my girlfriend, I can tell from that look.&quot; Culo hastily urged Lisa out of the command room, back out into the tavern before Lisa finally had enough, spinning on her heels and forcibly stopping Culo in his tracks.</p><p>&quot;I think it's high time that you explain to me what is going on. Who are these people, how did you get involved with them?! Who was that lady, and what are you aiming for? I might have agreed to come here now, but what the fuck do you mean I’m aligned with you?&quot; Lisa shot her questions off in a rapid-fire fashion.</p><p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Culo sat her down at an empty tavern table. &quot;We're the Ghosts of Versia.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I figured. What are we aiming to do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Take down the current Versian state, most of all Harrison Industries.&quot; Geraldine's voice interrupted them before Culo could continue, Geraldine herself sitting down next to Lisa on the same wooden bench. &quot;Isn't that what you're here for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not here for something as grand as that, I'm just here because...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because you were raped and betrayed by your own villagers for a paltry hundred tenars.&quot; Geraldine placed it bluntly. &quot;And you're not the only one here. Look around. Don't you notice that there are more ladies than men in here? That's because the Versian military has been picking up the boys mostly, leaving the ladies to be comfort women or slaving away for a pittance. Well FUCK THAT!&quot; She slammed her fist on the table, earning the attention of the other recruits around.</p><p>&quot;Yea, fuck that! We deserve to be free, not under the thumb of the fucking Versian State!&quot; Another recruit agreed, pumping his fist into the air.</p><p>&quot;The Ghosts of Versia fights for a free Versia, one without tyranny!&quot;</p><p>&quot;FOR A FREE VERSIA!&quot; The rest of the tavern echoed back in a loud cheer, nearly deafening Lisa.</p><p>&quot;And it seems that you are our newest comrade. You must have seen it yourself, our people herded like cattle, treated like trash, ripped of everything they own to become another cog in a machine geared for a war that might never happen!&quot; Geraldine wrapped her arms around Lisa. &quot;Don't you feel anger at those who have wronged you? Those who had cast you aside like another sack of meat to rape and fuck?&quot;</p><p>The memories of the rape and the betrayal of the villagers came flooding back into Lisa's mind, overwhelming her emotions as she suddenly felt a sense of comradery among the recruits in front of her. Finally, there were people like her willing to fight back against the injustice, to fight against the wrongs, the crimes, and the sins levied against her. &quot;I am.&quot;</p><p>Geraldine scoffed. &quot;That's all you got to say? Say you're angry! Say it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm angry!&quot; Lisa gritted her teeth, her fist clenched as she pictured the officer who drugged her, Hikub who had betrayed her, Akola who had duped her, the lady who had stolen her rations - everything wrong so far scrounged up into her balled fists.</p><p>&quot;Not good enough! Say I'm angry as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm angry as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'M ANGRY AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!&quot; Geraldine roared.</p><p>&quot;I&quot;M ANGRY AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!&quot; Lisa too let out all her anger and sorrow into a powerful shout that was followed by cheering from the other recruits who began to pat and swarm her.</p><p>&quot;Damn right. You'll be a damn good Ghost once we're done training you.&quot; Geraldine grinned as she smacked Lisa's back amidst the crowd.</p><p>While the recruits clamored and cheered the night away, Culo returned to the command room, where Sasha was still plotting lines, drawing marking between cities. Sasha eyed Culo from the periphery of her vision, scribbling on a piece of paper and handing it to him.</p><p>&quot;No, I didn't tell her the truth. She'll act better as a leader if she doesn't know. We can send her ahead after a week of basic training with Geraldine to Tenar to setup.&quot;</p><p>Sasha mulled over the potential plan, before tapping another mark on the map, though Culo shook his head. &quot;Desham and Creuliz can be set up later - the most important cities to infiltrate are Tenar and Ocra. Tenar is even more important now that I have this piece of information.&quot; Culo retrieved a letter from his inner armor, the letter seal still stained with the blood of the officer he killed.</p><p>Ripping the letter, Sasha read it carefully before her eyes widened, raising her hand to mockingly punch Culo, who held up his two hands in surrender. &quot;I couldn't show you the letter with Lisa around!&quot;</p><p>That appeased Sasha, but she still moved in a hurry, quickly drawing up a new series of plans, marking random Xs and search areas all around the outskirts of Tenar, before labeling them with numbers. Culo instantly got the gist, nodding his head. &quot;I'll get three teams, we'll have the route ascertained. As soon as Kyle arrives, we'll be in position to take down Harrison in one fell swoop.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 103 - International Expansion</strong></p><p><em>Two weeks later...</em></p><p>The sweltering heat blasted down on the dry, cracked earth of the refugee camp, and the devastation it wrought on the surroundings has spread even further in the months since its establishment. More and more streamed in from neighboring villages and towns, evacuating in the hopes of escaping to Tenar. Yet not all were brought here against their own will.</p><p>The snaking queue to enter the camp was jam-packed with refugees lugging everything precious to them, cowering under flimsy makeshift cloths to shield them from the blistering heat and the gusts of dirt that surge through the queue at regular periods. In the midst of the queue, a young, hopeful man gaped in awe of the looming walls of Ocra that seemed to block the entirety of the horizon beyond, the rest dotted by secondary forts laid out in defensive positions overlooking the desecrated fields.</p><p>As he took in the view, he suddenly was forcibly shoved aside by a rough meaty hand against his shoulder, his body toppling to the floor while his mouth tasted the dusty ground. Infuriated, he scrambled back to his feet, intending to fight the man who pushed him out of the queue, only to recoil, intimidated at the sight of the man instantly.</p><p>He bore countless black swirling tattoos that glistened under the light across his tanned body, some of which seemed to be counting into the hundreds. In his burly left hand was a long metal arctech chain attached to the handcuffs of two prisoners trailing behind him, the prisoners' heads covered in a thick black sack that blocked their vision. The young man yelped in fright, scampering away from the trio, unwilling to fight the tattooed man who was clearly intending to sell the prisoners.</p><p>His vicious eyes scanned the motley queue ahead of him, mostly composed of terrified refugees unwilling to risk any conflict. Those who met his gaze immediately stepped aside, allowing him to walk closer and closer to the entrance of the refugee camp, save for one brave soul: a grimy, soot-covered blacksmith, his arms as thick as logs. He crossed one over the other, standing firmly in place and stopped the tattooed man dead in his tracks with an equally fearsome glare.</p><p>&quot;Who said you could just waltz in like-&quot; The blacksmith barely got the words out of his mouth when the knuckles of the tattooed man's right fist collided with his jaw in an instant, the force cracking apart the bone beneath and sending him sprawling onto the ground, blood spilling out his mouth.</p><p>The tattooed man ignored the screams and cries of the blacksmith's family, merely gurgling and spitting a glob of saliva and mucus on the ground before pointedly stepping over the blacksmith's body towards the front of the queue. This time, no one else dared to raise a finger against him, the line of refugees parting like frightened Tusken Rabbits in the daytime. A slight grin appeared on his face, clearly elated by the pride and respect now awarded to him.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Versian soldiers guarding the queue were far less intimidated. Three recruits immediately aimed their rifles at the tattooed men, fanning out and surrounding him. &quot;Put the chain down and place your hands in the air!&quot; one of the recruits shouted nervously, the small shaking in his grip visible while the barrel wobbled.</p><p>The tattooed man turned to face the nervous recruit, his eyes boring deep into the recruit's soul as he spoke slowly. &quot;Boy. You better get someone here who actually recognizes these tattoos, or you're going to have a terrible time in Ocra.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha...&quot; The nervous recruit blinked rapidly, trying to process the statement in his head before a sudden hand grabbed his rifle's barrel and forced it down. Training kicked in, and the recruit launched an elbow toward his unknown assailant only to find out that it was his sergeant in charge.</p><p>&quot;Recruit! What the fuck do you think you're doing to our esteemed veteran?!&quot; The sergeant roared directly into his ear, nearly deafening him. Out of confusion, the other two recruits lowered their rifles as well while the sergeant stormed forward, grabbing all three of them into a line. &quot;Can't you see the damn ranks on his neck? This man fought in the independence war, honorably discharged as an officer! You better apologize right this instance-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No need for that, Sergeant Kola.&quot; The tattooed man patted the sergeant on the shoulder. &quot;Instead of us standing around out in this heat, maybe we can get a drink together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;O-Of course, Makoa, sir!&quot; Kola hurriedly saluted, his boots clicking together in a military posture.</p><p>&quot;I'm not an officer anymore, Kola, relax.&quot; Makoa chuckled.</p><p>&quot;You'll always be my officer, sir.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then maybe you can pay for that drink. I am pretty thirsty - walked a long way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes... what about those two?&quot;</p><p>&quot;These two?&quot; Makoa scoffed as he tugged on the chain, one of the prisoners staggering forward from the sudden jerk. &quot;Some Yual dogs I caught trying to smuggle Versian refugees across the border. Was hoping they would be worth something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We don't deal with slavery here in the military.&quot; Kola's face darkened slightly, only to have Makoa breaking out in laughter.</p><p>&quot;Kola, Kola, still a stuck-up as always. Who said I was selling them to you? That's my business. Now, are you going to let me in or not?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes, of course.&quot; Kola immediately motioned for the gate to the refugee camp to be opened, a creaky flimsy metallic fence gate balanced on weak hinges swinging open, the recruits saluting Makoa as he and Kola walked past into a crowded street. The street was filled to the brim with slimy foremen and pimps ready to pick off the next fresh refugee that walked through the gate, while other starving refugees waited with bated breath in the recesses between tents, hoping to pick up the leftovers from any fights or scuffles. They were clearly disappointed when they saw the burly Makoa entering instead flanked by Sergeant Kola. Many quickly dispersed and acted aloof when the two of them walked past.</p><p>&quot;Interesting setup you got going here,&quot; Makoa remarked as they moved through the dense waves of people surging to and fro, though most of the refugees made way for them, unwilling to tangle with the Versian military soldiers. Makoa could already see a few angry stares at his chains, dragging the two prisoners in cuffs behind him. The two prisoners stumbled and tripped over rocks and pebbles, unable to see their steps clearly through the black sacks wrapped around their heads. Some even began to trail them, following them through the crowd at a distance.</p><p>&quot;We had to do what we can to save the people. This looks bad, but when the war starts, I'd rather them be alive here under protection than dead. We have multiple layers of defensive lines ready to stop any Yual advance. Secondary forts, trenches, you name it.&quot; Kola replied, kicking a broken basket out of the way while his hand gripped a handgun on his belt tightly, ready to pull it at any moment.</p><p>&quot;You look a little on-edge given all the 'protection' you just mentioned.&quot; Makoa motioned to the handgun that Kola was gripping, noticing Kola's nervous glances towards a few seedy individuals in the crowd.</p><p>&quot;You don't know the half of it. Some of the refugees have managed to arm themselves and carve zones of control through the camps. Attacks on soldiers aren't exactly new.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's new? Same shit in the last war. I wouldn't have expected anything different from Masir.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Forget Masir - sure, he was the biggest gang in Ocra, and he still is, but with such a high influx of refugees, cliques and groups are being formed and broken apart on a daily basis, fighting for rations non-stop. Let's talk somewhere else where your prisoners will stop drawing so much attention.&quot; Kola motioned towards a seedy-looking shop, pushing past the curtain to reveal a small rundown bar with dilapidated tables and rickety chairs, mostly empty save for an old scrawny bartender cleaning and the light crackle of an arctech radio hung on the damp countertop.</p><p>[Acting President Monero has vouched that he will do everything to secure peace with Raktor in spite of recent rising tensions but will also not reduce the expansion of the Versian Military. Here's what he had to say at yesterday's peace negotiations.] The Versian news blurted out on the radio as Makoa and Kola took a seat at a secluded table near the back corner of the bar, the prisoners chained to a pillar nearby. [&quot;While peace negotiations are certainly a possibility, our sovereignty will never be challenged again. Having rooted out the source of corruption in our government, we must take further steps to ensure that we can defend the rights we have come to love and adopt. Every Versian must do his part to protect our state from the tyranny of the Yual Dominion!&quot;]</p><p>&quot;Anything you'll like? What about an Euria wine? They are quite popular these days.&quot; Kola turned around to face the board hanging above the bar, not noticing Makoa let out an involuntary shudder.</p><p>&quot;Perhaps just a simple glass of water to start with before we move on to the hard stuff. I'm thirsty.&quot; Makoa suppressed his nervousness.</p><p>&quot;Never expected to hear a drunkard like you say that, but sure.&quot; Kola raised his hand to the old, scrawny bartender, motioning with two fingers.</p><p>&quot;Make that four glasses,&quot; Makoa called out.</p><p>The bartender shot a quick glance at the two prisoners, nodding his head. Kola turned back, eyeing Makoa suspiciously. &quot;You're acting surprisingly nice to those two prisoners. Didn't you say they were nobodies?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can't have them dying on me before I sell them off. You know Masir wouldn't take a defective product.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When I said I was going to treat you to a drink, I didn't mean I'd treat them too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Put it on my tab. I'll have the cash after I sell them.&quot; Makoa leaned back onto the wooden chair, the frame creaking slightly under the weight.</p><p>Kola let out a mirthless laughter while the bartender served them the glasses of water along with a jug for refill. &quot;I seem to recall you had a tab here in Ocra a long time ago, too. Wonder if anyone recalls it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I sure as hell don't.&quot; Makoa swirled the water in his glass before gulping it down in one go.</p><p>Kola watched Makoa swirled the water in his glass, before he gulped it down in one go. &quot;What are you really here for, Makoa? Last I heard you got busted in Raktor for some unknown reason. I thought you were in jail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, here am I.&quot; Makoa stretched out his hand with a wide grin. &quot;Tasting freedom. Can't I return to where I was born after suffering in prison?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can't say it's the same Ocra you remember.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Seems that way.&quot; Makoa murmured as he refilled his glass again. &quot;I'm pretty much running blind here.&quot;</p><p>Kola squinted his eyes. &quot;What would you have done if I wasn't on shift guarding the refugee camp gate?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Same old, same old. Break a few heads, loosen a few mouths. Much easier to have a friend tell me everything. You were saying something about Masir before we entered.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you're thinking about rejoining Masir, don't bother. Nobody has seen him for days; he's been in hiding for a good long while, ever since the new kids on the blocks came into town.&quot;</p><p>&quot;New kids on the block?&quot;</p><p>Kola leaned forward, whispering to Makoa in a hushed tone. &quot;The Ghosts of Versia.&quot;</p><p>Makoa scanned Kola's face before a loud, unprompted laugh erupted from his mouth, slapping the table uncontrollably. &quot;HAH! Why are you whispering like a lady wanting to elope? What kind of stupid name is that? Who the hell had that kind of naming sens-&quot; Suddenly, Makoa caught a glint, a fearsome glare from one of the prisoners chained to the nearby pillar, sending shivers down his spine as he backtracked his words. &quot;I mean, they do sound a bit dangerous, no doubt, but why the need to whisper?&quot;</p><p>Kola hardly noticed Makoa's erratic behavior, far more concerned with making sure no one else was in the bar. &quot;The Versian military hasn't officially recognized the gang, so they've banned any discussion about it. But ever since they killed an officer out in the open two weeks ago, things have been getting much bloodier.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bloodier...? You're the damn military! If I was still an officer, I would taken a squad and wipe them all out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's the thing - we can't pinpoint their hideout. It isn't anywhere in the refugee camp, even when we raided multiple locations provided by our informants. And surprisingly, we're not the ones suffering the most damage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's Masir.&quot; Makoa summarized, earning a nod from Kola. &quot;So these... 'Ghosts' are currently set to takeover Ocra?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right now, it could be said that the Ghosts run the majority of the refugee camp, but Masir still rules the city proper. As I said, no one has seen Masir come out yet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe hiding like a little pussy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't say that in public, still loads of Masir's men vying for control in the camp. You never know when they are listening in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still paranoid as always.&quot; Makoa shrugged off Kola's concern. &quot;I doubt Masir even remembers me at all.... enough about him anyway. What's the deal with the war now? I heard they were going to try some negotiations?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe... but I doubt it would come to anything. From our view, Count Leon's military exercises have continuously pushed the limit. Some of its artillery fire has hit villages and towns nearby, resulting in the creation of this refugee camp. I don't see how the citizens of the Yual Dominion can support such an action.&quot;</p><p>Makoa simply nodded in agreement while he sipped on the glass of water, not revealing too much of his involvement in the stealing of military tech from Raktor. &quot;Seems like we're both in for a rough ride.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Seems that way... what are you going to do now?&quot; Kola ventured.</p><p>&quot;Not much. Sell them prisoners, then work out a plan to gamble my way into the capital. Should be the safest there, I'm done with anything Yual Dominion.&quot; Makoa stretched his arms, rising to get up before Kola suddenly stopped him, Kola putting his hands on Makoa's shoulders.</p><p>&quot;Hey, hey, what's the hurry? You just got back to Ocra; we should reminisce longer.&quot; Kola smiled nervously, trying to get Makoa to sit down.</p><p>Makoa squinted his eyes. &quot;Kola....you're not just a sergeant now, are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Makoa, I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you're going to try to trap me here, you're going to need more than a handgun.&quot; Makoa threatened.</p><p>&quot;Oh, we got more than just a handgun. Twelve of them, in fact.&quot; A familiar voice wafted in from the front of the bar, leading a dozen men who began to filter in through the tables and chairs towards Makoa.</p><p>&quot;Masir.&quot; Makoa gritted his teeth, standing to his full height as Masir's men all surrounded his table, while Kola quickly scrambled to the other side of the bar behind Masir. &quot;What did you do to Kola?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing much, nothing much at all. He just owes me a little favor, and it seems that with such a big catch, it is duly returned.&quot; Masir patted Kola's back with a hand adorned with five rings, each glistening with a different jewel, exuding wealth. He adjusted his flamboyant yellow shirt's collar and pants, both of which were clearly tailor-made to fit, a stark contrast to the thin, rugged clothes Makoa and his prisoners wore. &quot;You, on the other hand, have a very big favor to return. Interest racks up after seven years, you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heard you were squirrelling away in your little hideout, afraid of the Ghosts of Versia. Still making your little henchmen doing all the work?&quot; Makoa shot back with derision as he eyed Masir's dozen henchmen closing in around him.</p><p>&quot;Kola is such a good liar now.&quot; Masir chuckled, strolling through the bar up to Makoa calmly, each step resounding with a rich click against the hardwood floor boards. He held a smile on his face as he approached, before suddenly unleashing a brutal left hook that knocked Makoa over his chair, toppling onto the ground. &quot;You think I'm some bitch who's afraid of some new stuck-up Ghosts? Fucking country cunts who think they can run the show. They don't know half of what it takes to run Ocra Haul him back to the Chopping Block.&quot; Masir ordered his men while his gaze landed on the two prisoners still chained to the ceiling, one of whom was clearly scared out of his wits. &quot;Who do these two belong to?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Makoa's prisoners, apparently. He was intending to sell them off.&quot; Kola hurriedly replied from afar.</p><p>&quot;Intending to sell them off?! Without even thinking of greeting me?&quot; Masir exclaimed in mock surprise, looking at Makoa, who was restrained by four men.</p><p>&quot;I was planning to pay you off with the proceeds from their sale.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, a convenient plan. You might as well have gone with the birthday present excuse. It is my birthday tomorrow, so I'll be taking these two for myself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You little-&quot; Makoa tried to struggle but earned another fist from one of Masir's henchmen into his mouth, his gum now bleeding profusely from the successive hits. The four men hauled him onto their shoulders, carrying him like a coffin as they exited the bar, while Masir led the two prisoners along with the chain, tossing a tenar to the bartender. Kola had already scampered off, running back to his sergeant post.</p><p>Outside, Makoa's body was paraded through the refugee camp under the daylight, the four men intermittently beating him up on public display, instilling fear into anyone who saw them. &quot;MASIR IS IN CHARGE AROUND HERE!&quot; One of the henchmen roared as loud as he could into the ever-growing crowd of refugees clamoring to see the commotion. &quot;NOT THE BLOODY DUO, NOT THE GHOSTS - MASIR, AND ONLY MASIR!&quot;</p><p>Masir smiled for a while as he led the procession through the sea and bustle of refugees which naturally carved out to form a straight path. Yet there were still a few newer refugees who had just entered, unaware of what was happening. One of them, a starving lady, accidentally bumped into Masir and tumbled onto the floor, her rations spilling out onto the ground while the nearby refugees began to scramble for the free pickings.</p><p>&quot;STOP!&quot; Masir bellowed, the crowd of refugees freezing in motion, none of them daring to even move a single inch while he walked up to the lady and bent down, picking up the dropped flask of water. Surprisingly, he handed it back to the lady without another word, and even helped her pick up a sack of grain.</p><p>&quot;Thank you, thank you!&quot; The lady bowed profusely, clearly grateful for the assistance.</p><p>Masir held a gentle smile, patting the lady on the shoulder. &quot;If you ever need help, you know who to find.&quot; He returned to the procession, leading his men back to their destination. However, as soon as he was out of earshot, he motioned to another henchman, pointing to the lady. &quot;Get one of the little guys to beat her up, but not her face. She'll come back to us soon enough, and we'll need it for the new brothel.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p><p>As they continued through the myriad mess of refugee tents and makeshift shelters, Masir's keen eyes began to spot a few familiar silhouettes and clothes, seemingly being trailed by an unknown group. He kept an aloof expression, acting like he did not know what was going on. Soon, they finally reached their destination - a large logistical warehouse acting as one of the ration distribution centers of the refugee camp. Makoa's groggy vision swam with bright lights and never-ending rows of shelves as he was hauled through the warehouse, before being forced down onto a rusty metal chair in an abandoned room, his arms bounded to the coarse oxidized surface.</p><p>&quot;Make sure whoever the fuck is dumb enough to follow us is caught or killed. I don't care if their bodies are out on the streets. Get every man we have available here now. I want them all armed to the teeth.&quot; Masir wagged a finger at a henchman before sending him off to secure the outside. &quot;And you three, take these two prisoners down the stairs here to the waiting cells. They can be part of the next shipment to Tenar.&quot;</p><p>While Masir's men moved about, Masir himself drew up another chair nearby, plopping down right opposite the bleeding Makoa, who was still flanked by four henchmen. &quot;So, what brings my sworn brother back to the fold? Finally got tired of playing punk in Raktor?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I got sick of the taste of Yual in my water. Didn't know the water here still tasted like Masir crap.&quot; Makoa grinned, his teeth bloody from the punches. As soon as he finished the sentence, Masir flew into a rage, picking up the chair and swinging its legs at Makoa's head, nailing him right in the ear while Makoa crumpled to the ground, the metal chair clanging.</p><p>&quot;Still got a funny bone in you, huh? You think you can rip off the whole gang and just disappear for seven years and come back without a word?&quot; Masir sneered, delivering a sharp kick to Makoa's stomach. &quot;Not while I'm still alive, you fucking cocksucker.&quot;</p><p>Makoa coughed a mixture of blood and saliva, his face still grinning. &quot;It was just a hundred thousand tenars, no big deal- URK!&quot; He gagged as Masir kicked him once more in the leg, jolting pain arcing through his entire body while he involuntarily winced.</p><p>Masir grabbed him by the neck, hoisting him up with one hand. &quot;THAT WAS OUR ENTIRE SAVINGS! Our blood and sweat, all pilfered so you can go to Raktor with that dumb General Javel and fuck about with some sluts! We fought tooth and nail beside you in the fucking war and all you can do is give up on us? On Ocra?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y...you haven't seen what's possible in Raktor.&quot; Makoa wheezed with a grimace. &quot;You're nothing to the gangs there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like I give two shits. Ocra is my kingdom, big or small. We grew up here, we die here.&quot; Masir tightened his grip on Makoa's neck, choking him while Makoa's body writhed in the air. &quot;Not that a traitor like you would ever understand.&quot;</p><p>Despite the choke, Makoa still held a confident smile on his face. &quot;Fe-feel free to die here alone.&quot; Makoa eked out the words through the strangling grip, causing Masir to be utterly confused.</p><p>&quot;Is this bravado before your death, or....&quot; Masir's mind autocompleted the rest, dropping Makoa unceremoniously onto the floor with a loud crash. &quot;You, give me that damn arctech radio.&quot; He snatched the radio from one of the guarding henchmen, rapidly tuning the channel. &quot;How's the perimeter? Who was the group following us?&quot;</p><p>However, no one responded, only static echoing on the radio's speaker. Masir immediately burst out the door back into the wide-open warehouse floor and stormed up to the nearest henchmen. &quot;How many members do we have in this warehouse right now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir...?&quot; The henchman stared blankly at the flustered Masir.</p><p>&quot;Answer the damn question!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh.. uh, about fifty or so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Raise the damn alarm, get everyone down here and armed in a minute, or your head will be next on the chopping block. Are we clear?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-yes, sir!&quot;</p><p>Masir rushed back into the room, heading straight for Makoa and sitting him back upright. &quot;You! You fucking baited me out to get the Ghosts of Versia to come find me!&quot;</p><p>Makoa merely held a small smile. &quot;Took you long enough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You -&quot; Masir's words were cut short by a loud explosion on the side of the warehouse, sounds of pellet fire whizzing and ricocheting off the metal shelves, tearing into sacks of grain while screams echoed to the ceiling. &quot;Barricade the damn doors!&quot; He hurriedly ordered the remaining four henchmen, who quickly bolted the door with a heavy latch.</p><p>While the battle raged on outside, Masir began to check his handgun, ensuring there were enough pellets inside. &quot;Grab the bitch, and let's get the fuck out of here. Where's the exit?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, through the waiting cells. There's an exit that will get us back outside the warehouse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright, let's move.&quot; Masir motioned with his handgun before another shuddering explosion rocked the warehouse violently; dust loosened from the ceiling while cracks began to form in the walls. &quot;What the fu-&quot;</p><p>A starling loud scream erupted from down the stairs, where the waiting cell was. Masir immediately aimed the handgun at Makoa. &quot;What the fuck did you do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You shouldn't be worried about me - you should be worried about him,&quot; Makoa muttered cryptically.</p><p>&quot;Grrr! You, check out what the hell is going on down there!&quot; Masir ordered one of the henchmen, but it was already far too late as he watched the henchman get impaled against the wall, right in the chest by the rusted tip of a makeshift spear, seemingly wrenched out from the bars of the waiting cell. The remaining three immediately brandished their own handguns, aiming at the staircase, waiting to shoot anyone who came up while the sounds of screaming and fighting still broiled outside.</p><p>As soon as they spotted a human head, they immediately fired with abandon, blasting indiscriminately. Yet instead of the pellets fired tearing apart the skull, the pellets were all stopped in midair by an inconceivable, invisible wall, protecting the prisoner and allowing him to dash out to the impaled henchmen and grab the henchman's handgun.</p><p>With a swift swivel, he fired three impeccable shots, the pellets all finding their marks right between the eyes of each of the henchmen.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Masir's Henchman, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p>Before Masir could even react, the prisoner shot both of his thighs and ankles, a cry of pain leaving Masir's lips as he dropped his handgun and collapsed to the ground, clutching his writhing leg.</p><p>&quot;So, is this the best Ocra has to offer?&quot; The prisoner muttered as he slowly walked up to the squirming Masir. &quot;I can't say I am not disappointed.&quot;</p><p>Masir gritted his teeth, twisting his arm outwards to reach for his dropped handgun, only for the prisoner's feet to stomp mercilessly on his wrist, the feet grinding his bone against the concrete floor and sending waves of pain through Masir's body. &quot;ARGH!&quot;</p><p>Finally, the sound of the fighting beyond the door began to subside before a powerful magical falchion sliced through the hinges, causing the door to fall over flat with a loud crash. Makoa caught sight of the lady with the sword, his body hurriedly shirking away in instinctual fear.</p><p>[Boss, all targets are either captured or eliminated.] Sasha saluted to Kyle while the other Ghosts who trailed behind her merely stared at Kyle in confusion.</p><p>&quot;Good work. Have the rest of the members rescue those in the waiting cell. We'll sort them out later. And as for you... you seem like you know your way around Tenar, don't you?&quot; Kyle stepped down even harder, causing Masir to scream in pain.</p><p>&quot;Y-you! Don't you know who the fuck you're messing with!?&quot; Masir made a desperate attempt to frighten Kyle while he used his free hand to try and lift Kyle's feet off his wrist, yet he had no strength to overcome the sheer pressure Kyle inflicted. He could only stare in horror as Kyle stared at him like a bug to be squashed.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I know exactly who you are. You're the first step to my new international expansion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 104 - Catacombs</strong></p><p>&quot;Update,&quot; Kyle spoke as he took his seat at the head of the meeting table in the command room, nested in the main hideout of the Ghosts of Versia. He donned a simple factory worker's shirt and pants provided by Sasha, the basic white fabric and brown pants blending in with most of the other refugees while not being too overtly shabby.</p><p>Despite his order for an update, both Culo and Sasha instead stared blankly at him, seemingly frozen in time, while Kyle squinted his eyes. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, sir, it's just... I've never seen you wear... uhm... you look good.&quot; Culo blubbered with a fluster, Sasha nodding vehemently in agreement.</p><p>&quot;Cut the crap and focus. We're on a tight deadline.&quot; Kyle snapped his fingers. &quot;I've only been receiving your reports via letter, but now I want to hear them in full. And I want to hear it from Culo.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir. Since the month we've come here-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait. Sasha, get Feldon in here.&quot;</p><p>[Feldon?] Sasha cocked her head in confusion. [He's here?]</p><p>&quot;He was the second prisoner with me. Don't tell me you didn't see him when you were trailing us?&quot; Kyle squinted his eyes.</p><p>Sasha and Culo exchanged a confused glance before Culo coughed, trying to explain. &quot;Sir, to be frank, we were only informed of your arrival, not his.&quot; Culo scratched his neck nervously, his eyes avoiding Kyle's intense gaze. &quot;And it was hard to recognize Feldon as well, as his face was wrapped in-&quot;</p><p>Before Culo could complete his words, the meeting room burst open to reveal a haggard Feldon, restrained by two other Ghosts who tried to hold him back, but were clearly failing to do so. &quot;YOU IDIOTS LEFT ME BEHIND!&quot; Feldon roared. &quot;If I didn't know where the damn hideout was, I would have-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Feldon.&quot; Kyle interrupted his imminent rant. &quot;You know the reason why I brought you along on this business trip. Please don't make me regret it.&quot;</p><p>Feldon's anger immediately subsided as the adrenaline subsided, though he still forcibly shrugged off the two other Ghosts, plopping down on a seat and catching his breath. &quot;Yes, sir, sorry for the outburst. When I said 'idiots', I was referring to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;That hardly matters now. The two of you, please leave us.&quot; Kyle motioned to the two Ghosts, who looked at each other in confusion before Culo repeated the order to them, closing the door behind them. &quot;Now, let us focus on the operation at hand. Culo, please continue with your update.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-yes, sir.&quot; Culo saluted before using a stick to point toward a layout of Versia at the very center of the meeting table. &quot;Through the distribution of Euria-infused potions predominately, we have been able to acquire large swaths of control within Ocra. Our main competitor was Masir's gang, which had been the incumbent in the city for decades, though that's clearly no longer a problem.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Clearly.&quot; Kyle nodded. &quot;Any problems with the Versian military?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We've been avoiding them quite well - we haven't lost a single Ghost to them yet, though it is not clear how much of an effort they are putting to track us down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good, let's keep it that way for now. What about other cities?&quot; Kyle clasped his hands together, leaning against the map of Versia.</p><p>&quot;Tenar, Desham and Creuliz have already been infiltrated by trusted Ghosts, smaller cells being developed there. Sasha and I have already verified their locations and setup, they will serve well as fallbacks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well done.&quot; Kyle smiled as he began to collate all the information together, formulating the next step of the operation. &quot;I need three things: Harrison's whereabouts, Minister Dekar's location, and status of the war.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Minister Dekar's location is not certain of now, but from some of the intercepted military transmissions that we have seen, it is certain that he is still within the vicinity of Tenar.&quot; Culo picked up a letter and handed it to Kyle, who read it quickly, his eyes scanning left to right as he suddenly spotted an interesting mention.</p><p>&quot;They seem to be talking about something underground.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed. If our information and assumption is correct, Minister Dekar is hiding in the tunnels below the city. A catacomb.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Catacombs...&quot; Kyle muttered to himself. &quot;Do we know the entry points?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only some of them, but all of them require entry into the main city first. Security is tight now, but we suspect Masir knows how to get in through an external entrance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get the information out of him as soon as possible. We need to find a way in-&quot; Kyle stopped himself as he watched Feldon raise his hand meekly like a child asking a question in class.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, sorry, I'm just not too clear on why we need Minister Dekar's location...? He's not with Harrison, nor does he have any more ministerial power. Wasn't the goal to take down Harrison a peg?&quot;</p><p>Kyle sighed, rubbing his temples, fully intending to ignore Feldon's inane question until he realized both Culo and Sasha too were also dumbfounded by the question, unable to answer. This time, he wasn't too worried about there being a mole between the four of them, so Kyle took this opportunity to ensure everyone was on the same page.</p><p>&quot;Minister Dekar is a critical component in our operation to snatch Harrison's power base away. Despite his ousting from power, he still wields credible and tangible influence over a large part of the Versian population, being one of the original revolutionary leaders.&quot; Kyle explained. &quot;Having him as the face of our organization will give us the legitimacy required to build a credible threat competent enough to take down Harrison. If we can get a hold of him, we can begin to set up a counter-shadow government to contest the current one.&quot;</p><p>Kyle rose from his seat, pacing around the room. &quot;Consider the current scene - we have Harrison Industries and his underground organization, Nest, whose hitmen have attacked us more than once. They are clearly in cahoots with the government, having obtained every military contract. I have no doubts that Harrison will seek to profit off the imminent war, much like we do.&quot;</p><p>He jabbed at the layout of refugee camps scattered all across the four major cities. &quot;All of us know that the current evacuation of front-line villages and towns is a simple ploy to force industrialization and cheap labor into the cities, further strengthening his economic base by exploiting the desperation of the refugees. Those who comply are either recruited into the military or subject to work forever under Harrison. Those who don't suffer at the hands of various gangs around, such as Masir's gang.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then why don't we exploit the desperation of the refugees too?&quot; Feldon ventured, taking his chance to clear any doubts. &quot;We're a gang, not a charity organization. Since when did we become good-natured 'rebels' fighting for Versia?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is all a facade. Power in the shadows is power that endures.&quot; Culo answered, having gotten the gist of the plan.</p><p>&quot;Indeed. We will twist Harrison's own actions against him, using the very same discontent he intends to manipulate into our strength. With a ‘righteous’ banner and a purpose that others can rally behind, we can mask our movements, embedding it deep behind layers of motivation.&quot; Kyle clenched his fist. &quot;The entire first phase of the operation is to build the power base, using what we have already achieved with the Seven Snakes. Now that we have a stable line of communication from Ocra to Raktor, we can start to arm and supply the refugees, all while profiting off an imminent war. Are we clear?&quot;</p><p>The other three nodded in agreement, Feldon's eyes widening in understanding, though there was still a little problem with the plan for him. &quot;It's good to build a rebel force in hiding, but when are we going to actually use it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is why I need information on Harrison's movements and the status of the war; then, I can determine the next steps moving forward,&quot; Kyle replied.</p><p>&quot;As of now, Harrison has only been seen to be in Tenar, though we are unsure whether it is a body double or his true self. There have been observations by some of our members that Harrison Industries is still ramping up recruitment of arctech engineers from the various refugee camps, all concentrating towards Tenar. Apart from that, it's hard for us to get any secure, stable information from our members planted in Tenar.&quot; Culo summarized.</p><p>&quot;So we still do not know what Harrison is up to...&quot; Kyle muttered under his breath as his brain raced through the possibilities of Harrison's next move. Yet, without enough information, it was nearly impossible to figure out what the next step should be. If he made just one wrong move, everything he had set up would crumble easily, and he might have no choice but to return to Raktor. <em>Like hell I'm going to give up on my first international expansion like this.</em> &quot;Culo, try to wring out any information from Masi-&quot;</p><p>A sudden collective loud groan erupted from the tavern outside the command room, interrupting Kyle. Culo gripped the holster of a nearby handgun and carefully approached the door, opening to reveal shouts and jeers of derision at an arctech radio.</p><p>[A special feature - the man, the myth, the legend and pride of Versia for the coming decades: an interview with Harrison!]</p><p>&quot;Sasha, play it on the radio in here.&quot; Kyle ordered while motioning for Culo to close the door tightly. They began to listen intently to the radio interview.</p><p>[Harrison, so good to finally meet the star of our golden age!] The interviewer gushed with obvious excitement. [Tell me, how does it feel to be on top of the world?]</p><p>[Thank you for the kind compliments. It is indeed invigorating to have the capability and scale to change Versia for the better towards a new future. I am first and foremost a Versian at heart and soul, born and raised.] Harrison replied with a crisp, clean voice, his words clearly refined for the public.</p><p>[Truly impressive. Your story from rags to riches have been heard already countless times and serves as a inspiration for us Versians today. However, with war looming on the horizon, many have voiced concerns and doubts that we would be able to survive the coming storm. What do you have to say to that?]</p><p>[As many should know, Harrison Industries is heavily intertwined with the governement and military of Versia. We provide our services and products to the best of our abilities and the confidence placed in us by Acting President Monero speaks greater volumes about our stance on the coming war - we will not lose if it came down to a fight.]</p><p>&quot;That Harrison man must be crazy. Versia is a fraction of the population of Raktor, not to mention the military exercise is a joint program with the Counts of Kregol and Perlis! Is he crazy? We could throw three soldiers for every one Versian trained!&quot; Feldon exclaimed, only stopping when Kyle glowered at him, transmitting the universal expression for 'shut the fuck up.'</p><p>[Our weapons and armor technology have been designed and perfected by the best minds around, along with the innovative engineering process that allows us to accelerate blueprints from paper to reality. Whatever comes, we will be able to adapt quickly and with ease.] Harrison continued, hardly flustered at all by the interviewer's question.</p><p>[Indeed they will, but recent news about artillery strikes hitting Versian towns and villages near the border have seen nothing more than condemnation from Acting President Monero.] The interview's voice grew solemn. [Many have been devastated by the loss of their homes.]</p><p>[I understand the suffering of the people.] Harrison spoke calmly. [Yet, to rush into war is not the right way to ensure peace and stability. War breeds hatred and terror in a never-ending cycle, one that Versia may still be suffering the consequences of. While we will not back down without a fight, it is erroneous for us to initiate any foolhardy attack. But we are also soon deploying countermeasures that will be able to secure our borders better.]</p><p>[Countermeasures?]</p><p>[That's right. In response to the conflict, Harrison Industries has developed and innovated brand new weapons to counter the Yual Dominion. As a small nation, it is critical that our manpower be conserved and used effectively in battle. To that effect, I would like to announce an inaugural exhibition fair at the end of next month! Entry shall be free for all Versians so that all may see the glory and power that we can bring to bear at the frontlines.] Harrison announced with a joyous tone.</p><p>The rest of the interview was plain details about the exhibition fair, and the interview turned out to be a shell for Harrison to market this event. &quot;Did you hear about this exhibition before?&quot; Kyle asked Sasha.</p><p>[This is the first I've heard of it. I've never seen anything mentioned about it in any communications, military or not.]</p><p><em>Either Harrison just came up with it, or Nest is extremely proficient in securing information.</em> Kyle was more inclined to believe the latter, never underestimating his opponents. He had experienced his fair share of such cunning enemies and wouldn't put it past Harrison to be able to pull off such a feat. <em>Especially one with Galactic Era tech.</em></p><p>That was the true ultimate goal that Kyle had not told anyone else, not even Sasha - he had his suspicions that the catacombs beneath Tenar would reveal secrets and ruins much like that of the Oracle. Whether or not it had already been plundered did not matter to him; knowledge itself was the treasure. <em>And if I'm right, no one else should be able to access it. At least nobody without a System.</em></p><p>Kyle still hasn't ruled out that others could potentially have the same System they did - there was no reason to, and he felt it far more probable than no one else having the System. In fact, if no one else had the System, it would make it far harder for Kyle to gain an insight as to his origins in this world.</p><p>While Kyle pondered on the next steps, Feldon and the rest were already arguing about Harrison's motives. &quot;It's clear as day that the man is just your regular usual money-grubber. If we want to predict his moves, we have to start from there.&quot; Feldon offered his conjecture.</p><p>&quot;If he's a usual money-grubber, then he would have expanded into Raktor, not hole up in small ol Versia. Like you said, fraction of Raktor's population here.&quot; Culo readily disagreed, Sasha supporting him.</p><p>&quot;Well, maybe he likes the sound of tenars more than rakels?&quot; Feldon grasped at straws. &quot;And it looks like he doesn't really want the war from the sound of the interview.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's just a facade.&quot; Kyle joined the discussion. &quot;Without the war, his investments into the military sphere will be all for naught. He needs the war to happen, and so do we.&quot; He picked up a pen and began to draw up a plan, overlaying Versia. &quot;Culo, you are now temporarily in charge of Ocra’s Ghosts. Keep Makoa under tight supervision, and get Masir ready by tonight. I don't care how you extract the information - as soon as we know how to enter the catacombs, we will liaise with our forward Ghost cell in Tenar. And from there, we'll set up the dominos to fall one by one until we crush Harrison.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But we still don't know where he is!&quot; Feldon exclaimed. &quot;How are we going to crush him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't act like an idiot. Harrison himself just told us where he'll be in two months. And I fully intend to be present.&quot;</p><p>@@@@@</p><p>The dense primal trees of the Keru Forest around Ocra were being chopped down one by one, and their ancient age was ignored as they were used to build palisades and shelter and act as firewood for the refugees. Amidst the never-ending sawing that continued even through the night, a discreet arctech wagon slowly inched out from a thick undergrowth masking the end of a sewage tunnel, its wheels rugged against the uneven ground.</p><p>Inside the jostling wagon, only sniffling and crying could be heard from a dozen various girls chained together into a single metal cage, knowing their impending fate to be sold as slaves in Tenar. Some of the more desperate ones tried to catch the attention of the guard sitting right next to the cage, only to earn a sharp jab with a sharp pole that could draw blood from its pinpoint tip.</p><p>In the front of the wagon at the driver's cabin, Sasha, Feldon, and Masir sat together in an awkward silence, Masir's torture wounds having been healed by a potion. He gripped the rough steering wheel carefully, unwilling to go against the fearsome Sasha, whose every glance terrorized him.</p><p>&quot;Wish I was like Kyle back there, taking care of the ladies.&quot; Feldon whistled, trying to break the awkward tension, but Masir and Sasha hardly replied.</p><p>Contrary to Feldon's expectations, Kyle was hardly interested in the slave girls he was guarding. He knew for a fact that they had been kidnapped off the streets of Raktor, ladies from middle-class families. Already, a few of them noticed his clear Raktor roots, trying to appeal to his nationality, yet it drew no compassion from him. Not much could.</p><p>He had never considered himself to be a citizen of the Yual Dominion despite the former owner of his body being so. To him, it was just a playground, a test of his abilities. Combined with the System, it was almost beginning to feel like a game. <em>Almost.</em></p><p>Kyle still also couldn't rule out the possibility that the world was a VR game entirely, though the existence of the Oracle Chamber and his supposed Administrator privileges were already evidence that it went much deeper. Only with more information could he narrow down the possibilities. He clambered towards the front of the wagon, rasping his knuckles on the window. &quot;Put on the camo.&quot; He motioned to Feldon, pointing his finger at a small briefcase that Sasha was holding onto.</p><p>&quot;The camo...?&quot; Feldon held a confused gaze, his eyes shifting back and forth before he snapped his fingers in realization. &quot;Right, the makeup from Haui’s store!&quot;</p><p>Kyle groaned, before shuffling back to his original position, taking out a small canister which held a slightly-transparent cream, one that would alter their appearance enough to be considered different. The cream felt slightly mushy and lumpy, but Kyle didn't care as long as it did the job. As soon as he was done applying it to his face, he closed his eyes, taking a break for the long trip ahead, though he remained continuously aware of his surroundings.</p><p>Just before the first rays of daylight hit the skies above, the wagon reached its destination - a seemingly nondescript cave opening big enough to fit a single person. There were no markings nor fixtures whatsoever anywhere, only the natural foliage of the forest surrounding it. Kyle wouldn't have made a mental note of the place if it weren't for three clearly armed men filtering out through the entrance the moment the wagon approached.</p><p>&quot;Name and license.&quot; The leader of the three armed men gestured as he approached the cabin door cautiously, his right hand never leaving the rifle's holster slung in front of him. Kyle peered out through the slits of the wagon's cloth, noticing the gear of the armed men. They were well equipped, featuring nearly a full arctech knight armor set though at reduced thickness, favoring mobility over durability.</p><p>&quot;Masir, here to deliver the goods as promised. Where's Yona?&quot; Masir opened the cabin door gingerly so as to not alarm the armed men, carefully stepping out onto the ground while rummaging through his pockets, before handing over the license, a small piece of scribbled paper, to the leader.</p><p>&quot;Yona's busy. I'm in charge here now.&quot; The leader grunted as he checked the license. &quot;Get all your men out here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, sir.&quot; Masir bowed hastily before turning back to holler violently. &quot;HEY! GET THE FUCK OUT HERE NOW, LINE UP!&quot;</p><p>Kyle, Sasha, and Feldon followed the plan, coming up front and lining up in front of the armed men, with the leader inspecting them. However, as soon as the leader spotted Kyle's face, he nearly let out a shriek, recoiling back in horror. &quot;Goddess above, what the fuck happened to you?&quot;</p><p>Kyle cocked his eyes, but Masir hurriedly stood between them, smiling sheepishly. &quot;This one, he's a young man I took pity on. Terrible accident with a few arctech devices left him freckled, acne notwithstanding. Safe to say, those warts aren't going away anytime soon.&quot; Masir explained.</p><p>&quot;You need an alchemist to get you checked up.&quot; The leader nervously leaned in to get a whiff before nearly belching in disgust. &quot;That smell won't be getting you any girls anytime soon, that's for sure.&quot; Still, he did his job, holding up a list of portrait pictures against Kyle's face and comparing them. &quot;Right, you're good to go.&quot;</p><p>The moment the leader turned to face Feldon, he too recoiled, though the shock was to a lesser extent. &quot;Are you picking up a circus? One got warts, the other got burns, and the last is just a shame!&quot; The leader furiously glowered at Masir.</p><p>&quot;What can I do? Military been grabbing all the good ones. Look, I don't think Yona is going to be too happy about us being held up here. How about we stop griping about my men's looks and let them have their peace, all right? I'm sure their social life is already bad enough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine. Your license is good. Don't forget to renew it end of this month.&quot; The leader finally relented, handing back the license and motioning for the two other armed men to open the way. Kyle and the rest got back on the wagon, Kyle carefully watching as the tight entrance was slowly expanded, the original limits of the opening actually part of a mechanical door with a stone facade.</p><p>&quot;Pretty smart of them to hide it in plain sight. Just another cave; who knew it could open to fit a wagon?&quot; Feldon murmured to himself as Masir lurched the wagon forward. The cave opening enlarged to reveal a tunnel road, providing smooth travel for incoming arctech wagons along with intermittent lights embedded all along the road.</p><p><em>This isn't good. If we want a sustainable smuggling route, it can't be one controlled by Nest.</em> Kyle eyed the various Nest patrols sparsely posted along the tunnel route as they descended into the depths, going deeper and deeper in a barely noticeable decline. Taking over such a tunnel would no doubt raise the suspicion of Harrison, not to mention bring the entire Nest organization down on him. <em>There must be another way in.</em></p><p>The wagon had to hit a few more checkpoints; the Nest checks were extremely thorough. Kyle gritted his teeth as he endured the mocking and pity from some of the Nest patrol members, memorizing their faces so he could enslave them personally when he was ready. Each checkpoint only further impressed him that this route was definitely not feasible.</p><p>Soon, the wagon finally hit the end of the road, the tunnel road leading into a slightly larger cavern where there was ambient water flowing through ancient canals dug out centuries ago, the stench horrid. Masir tapped the cabin in a known pattern, signaling for Kyle and the others to get out. The port was active, able to berth a total of four ships that seemed to be regularly ferrying cargo and products much like the slave girls they had brought to and fro, the boats periodically hurtling off down the rushing waves to an unknown fate. Kyle noticed a few shipments headed for other destinations far beyond Tenar, proving that the underlying network of tunnels and catacombs was not only restricted to the capital city.</p><p>The slave girls to be sold were transferred onto a smaller boat, the boat powered by a strong arctech motor that allowed it to sail up the currents within the rivers of the catacombs. As Kyle strolled towards the designated boat, he caught the glance of a nervous Nest worker, who quickly avoided eye contact and acted like he had never looked at all. The nervous Nest worker's behavior clearly stood out from the rest of his raucous and brutish colleagues, making for an intriguing sight, Kyle making a mental note. <em>Interesting...</em></p><p>While the slave girls were being herded onto the deck, Masir clasped his hands nervously as he leaned over to Kyle, whispering urgently. &quot;I brought you all the way in here. Once you deliver the slave girls, if you walk right up to the end of that specific canal and look out for the sign 5A, that�s where you'll find a service ladder from which you can enter Tenar proper. This is where we'll part way-&quot;</p><p>Masir suddenly felt Kyle's arm slung around his shoulders in a chummy fashion, as if they had been best brothers since childhood. &quot;Masir, let me guess what's going to happen the moment you leave us. You're going to tip off Nest that we are in the city, and hope that they will be enough to kill us so you can regain control of Ocra.&quot; Kyle smiled jovially as he patted Masir on the shoulder, making it seem to the surrounding Nest workers and patrollers like they were sharing a joke. &quot;And here's what I'm going to do - I'm going to kill every last Nest member, slaughter through them all the way back to Ocra and find you, and then string you up upside down in a cell for the next fifteen years where no one will ever find you again. If such a future scenario is not to your fancy, I highly suggest you stick with us.&quot;</p><p>Masir recalled the brutality with which Kyle executed his henchmen, wondering if Kyle could really do what he said. As he glanced at Kyle's smiling expression, he intuitively felt a deepening sense of fear and unbridled power, his mind slowly convincing him that Kyle was speaking the absolute truth. He nodded slowly, earning a larger hearty smack on the back.</p><p>&quot;Good doing business with you, Masir. Always a pleasure. Now, if you would please.&quot; Kyle held that same eerie smile, leaving Masir shivering at the back of the boat while he headed to the front. With the preparations completed, Nest workers untied the boat's rope to the berth, allowing it to drift into the center before a designated boat operator revved up the motor.</p><p>The catacombs hardly had proper lighting, darkness enveloping the entire boat save for the cabin as soon as it entered the main channel, fighting against the rushing tide of sewage and other unknown objects caught in the stream that flowed through Tenar. &quot;Sasha, memorize the route,&quot; Kyle muttered under his breath, activating his Follower skill.</p><p>[Understood. I've already mentally mapped the location.]</p><p>&quot;Good.&quot; Kyle felt the boat swerve back and forth through the deafening black void of the dark canals, the Nest boat operator seemingly acting on muscle memory as though he had the entire map of the catacombs memorized in his head. Within a short ten minutes, Kyle could see a small little lantern in the distance, growing larger by the second while they approached the pre-arragned dropoff, Nest workers positioned on a small little docking pier that led into what Kyle assumed was an functioning workshop, sounds of intricate machinery audible over the rushing roaring currents.</p><p>The slave girls whimpered as they were dragged up the pier, some beginning to fight back in a desperate last attempt the moment they were hauled out of the boat, knowing what lay ahead was their final destination. Kyle didn't waste any time helping the Nest workers restrain and subdue them without hesitating.</p><p>&quot;Heading back now?&quot; The boat operator waved to Masir, who shook his head.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, champ. We got business in Tenar.&quot; Masir replied as the rest got off the boat onto the pier, waving his license paper as a form of proof while clutching it tightly, making sure it didn't drop into the canal.</p><p>&quot;Suit yourself.&quot; The ensuing churn of the arctech motor had the boat speed back off towards the pier while the Nest workers continued to force the slave girls into the factory, completely ignoring Kyle and the rest as he walked off, following Masir's lead.</p><p>&quot;Those slave girls, what the hell are they doing down here in the catacombs?&quot; Feldon asked Masir with a naive face.</p><p>&quot;Fuck if I care. Just to fuck or maybe even to work, I don't really give two shits. I got paid upfront, and I've done my part of the deal, that's all.&quot; Masir shrugged.</p><p>As the four of them trudged along the slimy moss covered side paths of the canals that were beginning to seem more and more like sewage tunnels, Kyle motioned to Sasha, giving her a series of orders through hand signs.</p><p>[Stay and watch the workshop?]</p><p>Kyle nodded, Sasha immediately compiling and vanishing without a trace. Neither Masir nor Feldon even noticed her leaving. Masir was fully focused on squinting through the darkness as he groped his way forward along the wall, intermittently cursing when he accidentally grabbed onto a bug.</p><p>&quot;Here we are, 5A.&quot; Masir motioned to a ladder mounted against the wall ahead, daylight streaming through the rim of a manhole cover. &quot;After you,&quot; He bowed respectfully, but Kyle instead drew out a handgun and prodded him.</p><p>&quot;You first,&quot; Kyle ordered, not taking no for an answer.</p><p>Masir's face paled, but he complied anyway, quickly clambering up the ladder while Kyle kept a steady aim on him with his free hand as he followed closely behind. Masir grunted as he shifted the manhole cover outside, peeking his head out to check for anyone watching before clambering upwards, Kyle also climbing out with Feldon in quick succession.</p><p>They found themselves in a secluded alleyway, yet unlike Raktor, there were hardly any homeless men languishing in corners or slums built into the crevices of buildings with kids sniffing drugs. Instead, it was clean and spick, well kept with neatly arranged trash in piles or containers. The stark difference made Kyle feel slightly disorientated, as though he had been teleported into a different era. <em>That's impossible. Cities of this era should be crime-ridden and filled to the brim with filth in overcrowding and trash. How can this be?</em></p><p>Even when Masir led them out to one of the main streets, the roads, pathways, curbs, and sidewalks were all spick and span, looking like a picturesque city straight out of a fantasy book that glossed over all the horrid details of human dwellings. Bright portraits of young ladies showing off the latest fashion and quaint little cafes along the road all spoke of a society clearly dominated by decorum.</p><p>[Grand Versian Exhibition, proudly sponsored by Harrison Industries!] An arctech billboard blasted out, a light-thrower plastering the wide, handsome, grinning face of Harrison on a black background. [You don't want to miss it!]</p><p>&quot;This doesn't seem like the evil den of a money-grubber. People here look.... happy.&quot; Feldon remarked as he watched a group of schoolboys shout and playfight over pieces of bread, uncaring of the food wastage. &quot;This is nothing like the refugee camps! Is this where the nobles live?&quot;</p><p>Masir scoffed. &quot;Nobles? We haven't had nobles in Versia for fifteen years, unlike you Yual dogs! This is the lower quarters - every citizen living here has the same standard of living. Welcome to Tenar.&quot;</p>
