<p>Chapter  19: New Ventures</h1></p><p>With the other moonshiners hauled off to holding cells, Eric was manhandled to another room. “Let go of me! I can walk by myself, thank you very much.” He tried to shake off the guards’ grips.</p><p>Kyle nodded his head as a signal, and the two guards let go of Eric. They walked through the common area, Eric taking note of the associates training hard against dummy figures or sparring with each other. Tons of Stamina Potions were stacked in wooden crates along the side, causing Eric’s mouth to fall agape in astonishment. </p><p>“I did not expect your production scale to be so huge,” Eric was astonished, estimating close to a thousand potions were stacked there alone, accumulated over the weeks. “I was under the impression that you were only supplying less than fifty per day or so.”</p><p>Kyle didn’t reply, still walking toward an unmarked door. They entered a separate room, and this time Eric’s jaw completely collapsed. Forgetting his predicament as a captured moonshiner, he ran forward, ogling at the unique distillation apparatuses that were far more advanced than anything he had ever seen, even at the university. </p><p>“I… I’ve never seen anything like this! Where did you get it from?” Eric was like an excited fanboy, jumping up and down as he examined the intricate details of the setup. </p><p>Kyle had implemented a factory-style distillation process, something he reverse-engineered from his memories. <em>Alcohol in the Galactic Era was produced much more efficiently, but at least the basic principles remained the same.</em></p><p>Eric suddenly let out a loud gasp. “This condenser is extremely unique! What is the jagged surface on the exterior of the condensation arm? This enchantment on the barrel—what does it do? Is it powered by arcia to give special effects?” He ran around a series of kegs, noticing they had unique enchantments on them as well that seemed to speed up the fermentation. </p><p>Kyle motioned for one of the guards to provide three samples in small cups. Eric was a bit hesitant, knowing there was a chance it could be poison or some sort. </p><p>“Professor Dicar, if I wanted you dead, I would have had you killed there and then, making it look like an accident.”</p><p>Eric finally relented and tried the first sample. It was a high-proof moonshine whiskey, free of any impurities, and smooth on the throat. “My God! It’s even better than anything I have tasted!”</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Moonshine Whiskey</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A high-proof whiskey distilled with precision and factory-level quality. None of that rugged taste</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Temporary Stat Effect</strong>:  -5 INT, +3 STR. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Duration</strong>: Depends on the imbiber’s race</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He quickly drank the next sample, savoring the bubbling sensation with a sweet aromatic taste. “This is wine… but not one made from the usual ingredients… Grain wine? The sparkling sensation is not unique, but the combination is.”</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Cherry Sparkling Sake</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A sparkling rice wine made from polished grains. Smooth taste with a posh feeling</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Temporary Stat Effect</strong>: -5 INT, +3 STR. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Depends on the imbiber’s race.  </p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Eric then tried the last one. “Another grain wine, but this time with a burning sensation, highly distilled. The addition of the lemon taste gives it a secondary kick. Amazing! Where are all these recipes coming from?! I’ve spent my life studying alcohol, but I have never come across any of these!”</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Lemon-Flavored Soju</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A mixture of grains fermented. Mixed with a dash of lemon. Great with beer or yogurt</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Temporary Stat Effect</strong>: -2 INT, +1 STR. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Depends on the imbiber’s race.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>You’d probably lose your mind in the Galactic Era, then…</em> “Do you want to know?” Kyle asked with a knowing expression.</p><p>Eric’s excitement suddenly plummeted, the circumstances of his current plight coming back to him. “Cut to the chase. What do you want?”</p><p>“Work for me, and you’ll have this entire room, where those recipes came from, and a brand new pub.”</p><p>“And my crew?”</p><p>“They’ll be part of the gang. I’m counting on you to convince them.”</p><p>“What if I say no?”</p><p>“You already know what happens.”</p><p>Eric weighed the benefits in his head. For years, he had been a professor researching new methods of alcohol production. He had been expelled for no reason due to the sudden and rapid ban on alcohol, forcing him onto the streets in order to make a living. </p><p>Too many gangs had tried to recruit him, even with the threat of force, but a simple bribe and a few drops of moonshine were always enough to get the guards to go against their bosses and break away from the gang. That was how he met his current crew, anyway.</p><p>However, Kyle had shown him a new path, a chance to regain his old life. The new recipes lured him tantalizingly, and he couldn’t stop thinking about all the types of alcohol he could make with the setup in front of him. <em>Perhaps I can learn the recipes, then slowly get away as well. </em></p><p>“You have a deal. Let me talk to them.”</p><p>Eric was brought to the holding cell, where the other four moonshiners were still restrained. “Eric, you all right? Just agree to whatever they say; we’ll break out soon enough.” Adrian said, worried.</p><p>“Yes, I’ve accepted their deal. We will all be Seven Snakes members for now.”</p><p>“Great, I’m starving.” Monica’s stomach rumbled loudly. This wasn’t their first rodeo, having escaped a few gangs before. “We’ll be out of here in no time.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The pub restoration was now underway, with Kyle estimating that it may take two weeks to get it up and running. He had already fired the former bartender, and any existing Seven Snakes members who had a tab running were forced to work extra hard to clean up the messes. It was not any fun cleaning up a place where their own vomit and piss had caked into the seams, but no one dared to go against Kyle any longer, not after his showing of force in multiple fights. </p><p>It would still take some time for the new gang members to be accommodated, but Kyle already began to see an opportunity for expansion. However, he did not rush anything, instead building a solid, loyal power base and providing enough time for the integration of new members into the fold. It would be foolish to make any major moves or large recruitment campaigns where potential spies from both the enforcers and the Ardent Cretins would enter. </p><p>Damian soon returned from the induction of Eric Dicar’s crew. “Sir, the induction is complete, though I get this feeling that they may look for every opportunity to break free.”</p><p>“Keep a close eye on them. They are competent in their jobs, especially Adrian.” Kyle had managed to outwit them, not through prediction but by covering all possible hideout locations. Damian, being planted among the squatters, was just one of many members—Kyle had mobilized twenty members, split up to attempt to form a net around them. <em>If I can entice Adrian to remain with us, it will be of great benefit to my gang.</em> </p><p>Kyle was also aware of the seemingly close ties that the crew had with one another, something unusual in criminal groups. Holding one of them in the Seven Snakes would then serve as an additional guarantee against a potential backstab or departure. </p><p>“We should begin to appoint vipers to provide a sense of responsibility in order to tie them down.”</p><p>Damian nodded in agreement. “Just like the Red Lions’ squad leaders. It would be good to have an inner circle of trusted, competent members.” Kyle had already previously announced the position of viper, but no one had yet to fill that role. All the associates were still gunning for it. </p><p>“Only after vetting them for a month or so. Choose the most hardworking ones or those who are competent. For example, Eric Dicar, who will be the new bartender for the pub once it has been relaunched, assuming he sticks with us. And by the way, I’m thinking about changing the name.”</p><p>“What?! How can you change a name like Seductive Serpent? It’s a well-known name in the district!” Damian was shocked, his nostalgia for the pub screaming out.</p><p>“Well-known for being a hellhole,” Kyle shot back, but he had to admit internally that he currently did not have a better name for it. He was never the best at naming things; his daughter in his former life used to always complain about it.</p><p>“What should we do about that woman?”</p><p>“Monica? She can handle logistics for the brothel and the pub for now. But do have her and Adrian help out in the free soup kitchen and at public cleanup events as well.”</p><p>“Got it. Are we planning on selling the alcohol? I got a few contacts who might be willing to buy from us,” Damian offered, knowing the alcohol recipes by Kyle were bound to be a hit with the locals, especially if sold at an affordable price. </p><p>“Not for now. We’ll make it exclusive to the Seductive Serpent to draw in customers and turn them into loyal regulars,” Kyle replied before stopping as he saw a wide, shit-eating grin on Damian’s face. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing. Just glad you kept the name.”</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>Kyle was soon left alone in the office, pondering over the next steps. There was no doubt the performance of the pub would be greatly improved now, but it remained to be seen whether it would be enough to pay off the Crimson Swords’ debt. </p><p>The main two income streams were the potions contracts with other minor gangs and the Red Lions, as well as the Lusty Arcian. Kyle performed a quick calculation, noticing that they were still off target, unable to clear the debt within the time limit provided. <em>I can’t just sit around and wait for the pub to be completed—I have to look for other options.</em></p><p>It was already abundantly clear that the weapons and human trafficking markets were currently off-limits. Kyle had plans for a public soup kitchen and a regular cleanup event to integrate Seven Snakes into the local social fabric. By showcasing their worth and benefit, they could stave off any lingering hate accumulated by Ulon, as well as garner goodwill and potentially information from the homeless and squatters who would frequent the soup kitchen the most. <em>It will serve as a good recruitment zone as well. </em></p><p>Suddenly landing on another idea, Kyle quickly called for Keith to come. “Keith, I need you to find potential casino locations, preferably ones we can strongarm or buy over in good condition to reduce the amount of construction work needed.”</p><p>Keith nodded. Casinos were par for the norm amongst gangs in Raktor. “I’ll work with Damian on it. He knows much better than I do how to properly cover up a casino.”</p><p>“Good. Try to get it done at the same time as the pub.”</p><p>Kyle felt restricted; his movements were watched from every corner. It seemed as though he had been locked into his own sandbox by Sebastian and the other slightly larger gangs. He currently did not have the power to break through the implicit blockade, so he needed to find more advantages if he wanted to avoid succumbing to the debt. </p><p>Forgoing payment of the debt would also leave a big target on his back. Kyle was sure he was not the strongest person in the city, so enticing hitmen and assassins to target him was not an ideal scenario. <em>Best case, we pay off the Crimson Swords, and it’s a done deal. </em>The completion of the loan repayment would also further boost their reputation, improving their influence in the black market and allowing them to take out bigger loans. </p><p>Kyle’s eyes wandered to the map of the city beyond its borders, where the forests and monster regions lay. <em>If I can’t expand in the city, perhaps I can obtain benefits from beyond its walls. Out there, I would be less observed and tracked. </em></p><p>He still had to determine what benefits he could obtain outside the city. <em>Come to think of it, I have never left the city since I came here. I should ask Damian and Keith. </em></p><p>However, for today, he would need to make some personal preparations before leaving, such as boosting his knowledge of arcia and its uses. Kyle was well aware that arctech would be the key focal point of many battles to come—it would be wise to learn as much as he could over the next few weeks.</p><p>The technological level of the world he was in was haphazard, and unlike historical advancements, thanks to the existence of arcia. The past few days had him setting up the in-house brewery. In the night, he studied the tome left behind by Theorin in order to understand arctech better.</p><p>The book taught the basic engravings and how to combine them and overlay their effects. Kyle had already done a preliminary implementation of the fermentation of mash in the kegs, allowing him to implement a simple decay engraving, accelerating the fermentation process and subsequently the production of alcohol.</p><p>If he had his way, he could implement microgravity brewing fermentation processes from the Galactic Era here. However, such engravings that could manipulate the very laws of physics were naturally extremely rare.</p><p><em>Arcia is far too amazing. If discovered, such an exotic material would have the entire human quadrant scrambling for it. </em>Kyle had yet to find evidence that he was even in the same universe or timeline as his original one, though he still did not believe that arcia was magic or fantasy.</p><p>It was more like electricity—radiation and oil—which the locals might also consider magical. <em>Anti-gravity, plasma weapons, and faster-than-light travel would be considered “magic” by the people here…</em></p><p>The study of enchantments had yet to yield a title or a bonus of sorts from the reading. Kyle surmised that it was a lack of implementation—he had always been rewarded for repetitive action rather than learning. </p><p>He returned to his room, where there were more than two dozen ordinary metal pipes on a table, along with Riker’s next to it. A single needle-like etcher hooked up to a portable arcia generator was placed as well, Kyle having bought it to practice. </p><p><em>Repetition is the key to success, after all.</em> Kyle sat down and began etching away at the metal pipes, copying the engravings on Riker’s. Right now, he only had a few pieces of arctech equipment, most of which were stolen from the Red Lions’ members.</p><p>It would be good if he could customize his own armor set and weapons. He dearly missed his exosuit from his former life, which made him wonder if he could replicate it in the future. The overlaying of enchantments and engravings reminded him of how nanocircuit boards were made. An arcia-printed circuit board did not seem too far out of the question. <em>Something to keep in mind.</em></p><p>The title was not as easy to reach as previous titles were, requiring multiple days of non-stop practice. As he reached his hundredth copied metal pipe, a title was finally awarded to him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Arcia Engraver (Basic)</p>
