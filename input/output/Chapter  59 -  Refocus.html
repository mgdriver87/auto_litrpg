<p>Chapter  59: Refocus</p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>The Seven Snakes were in a complete frenzy as Kyle began to ramp up the production.</p><p>Keith was over the moon with the baron’s acceptance of the steel and weapons factory, but was slightly confused by his leader’s next request.</p><p>“Wait, you want me to find people who look exactly like you?”</p><p>“It is normal for every person to have a doppelganger somewhere in the world. As long as they look about sixty to seventy percent alike, we can make up for the rest using makeup and disguises.”</p><p>“What are you planning this time?”</p><p>“There is a chance that I will go to Versia after a few months; once this factory project is completed and our control of the districts have stabilized.”</p><p>“What?!” Keith exclaimed.</p><p>Kyle had already made up his mind the moment he met Minister Dekar. Hedging his bets on his new venture was far safer than relying entirely on the purchase of his weapons by Count Leon’s military. There would be a clear cartel and barrier to entry. </p><p><em>Always have an escape route planned.</em> Versia was that escape route if it really came down to the wire. He had no clear loyalty to Raktor nor Versia, only the place that would give him the most profit. If Raktor did not provide that, then Versia would have to do. </p><p>To reduce suspicion from the local nobility and other gangs about his potential months-long disappearance in the future, he needed to find a doppelganger that could potentially act as him and throw off any potential observers watching him. He had already risked a lot heading over to the Culdao Peaks to negotiate with the minister.</p><p>“So you just want me to go to the streets and grab those who look the most similar?”</p><p>“Yes, try to find six if possible.” Kyle nodded his head, causing Keith to sigh and shake his head, wondering what Kyle was up to now.</p><p>“There’s no reason to go to Versia—we have no connections there and almost no stake. You’ll be pretty much going in blind,” Keith pointed out, trying to dissuade Kyle. “Versia is also too far away from us, so you won’t be able to access our current assets as well!”</p><p>“I will prepare well in advance, do not worry. We have half a year ahead of us.” Kyle waved his hand dismissively. “Look at what I started with in the Seven Snakes as well, and look where we are now.”</p><p>Keith was about to retort but held his tongue. He wanted to argue that Kyle did have certain connections, but he realized that he was thinking about “Alvin.” With Kyle’s prowess, he would succeed nearly everywhere—why would Versia be any different?</p><p>“The Seven Snakes would have to expand eventually. Moving to another city or country is always a given with time.  We as a whole have to think further, especially once we have secured our position here. I know you feel that, as we are right now, our progress will always be hampered by the Ardent Cretins incessantly. They are still restricting us economically. The way we overcame the original debt to the Crimson Swords was by expanding to the Culdao Peaks. Versia will be no different. ”</p><p>“You won’t be going alone, right? If you die in Versia…” Keith couldn’t bear to think of what would happen if Kyle died. He recalled how, just a few months ago, they had been a small gang of twenty to thirty members. Today, they numbered close to three hundred, thanks to the recruiting efforts of the free soup kitchen, public cleanup events, and bathhouse.</p><p>Keith would not dare to claim that the Seven Snakes were completely united as a capable force, but it was a far cry from the paltry command of Ulon. If Kyle were to die, this entire pyramid would most likely fall apart. Keith wasn’t as strong as Kyle to be able to hold the entire gang through charisma and strength. No one else in the Seven Snakes was, all putting their respect on Kyle rather than each other.</p><p>“Of course not. We will see over the course of our preparation. But I do have a few guides in mind.” Nearly all of his underlings were critical, and those that were not were ill-suited to serve as Versia guides or even bodyguards. </p><p>“Okay, I will immediately try to find the body doubles as soon as possible.” Keith saluted. Just as he was about to leave Kyle’s office, Niko barged in, panting wildly as he held a folder of documents in his right arm. </p><p>“Sir…” Niko panted, an exhausted grin on his face. “We got it! We got the license for the weapons factory!”</p><p>Kyle, too, had a wide smile on his face, immediately standing up and grabbing the licenses from Niko’s hand, checking them. “Call everyone into the office for a celebration. Now,” Kyle ordered Keith, who nodded immediately.</p><p>It took half an hour for all the vipers, the company heads, Gordon, Eric, and Damian to pause their current tasks and return, wondering what was so urgent for Kyle to call all of them back in. Only Keith and Niko had excited expressions on their faces, while the rest were utterly confused. </p><p>“You all have followed me for months, and some have followed me for nearly half a year now.” Kyle began his speech. “Since I took leadership in the Seven Snakes, we have grown exponentially, with our reputation and name soaring and reverberating throughout the South Sector. Even the gangs in the other sectors talk about us and our exploits on a regular basis with wonder and amazement in their tones.”</p><p>“Today, I would like to announce that as of this day, for the first time in Seven Snakes’ history, we have an official license to manufacture weapons for the military, just like every other major gang!” Kyle proudly showed off the license to them, causing Damian to nearly exclaim in shock.</p><p>Such a license represented one of the top positions in society—not any ragtag group could obtain it unless they had a master’s approval from the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths. Even for the bigger players, it was a feat unachievable just by asking. Every holder of the license had to prove their ability to deliver and would make an obscene amount of money from every military contract. Only the Ardent Cretins held a similar license within the South Sector.</p><p>Even Monica, Adrian, and Eric were at a loss for words. Just four months ago, they were simply a ragtag crew smuggling moonshine to businesses that continuously tried to undercut them. In fact, they had been planning to leave the Seven Snakes at the start. Yet now, they stood as one of the top members of the South Sector, respected by everyone. Their aspirations for freedom had already been assuaged by the sheer respect they received.</p><p>Eric nearly shed a tear when he recalled how far he had come. A disgraced university professor affected by the prohibition by the Sanctum of Yual was now a mogul in alcohol distribution and production. His recipes were the backbone of the entire operation, ensuring a consistent stream of dirty money into the Seven Snakes and his own pockets.</p><p>Gordon, too, was grinning to himself as he patted Reese on the back. He had just been a lowly arctech designer with no future—it would have taken him ten years alone even to have a shot at being the factory manager, but he now held authority as well as prestige.</p><p>Sasha was not too concerned with the license, but her own journey under the direct tutelage of Kyle had made her into a force to be reckoned with. No longer was she known as a weak, mute slave that could be easily bullied, even by other slaves. Instead, she reigned at the top next to Kyle, being the second strongest in the Seven Snakes.</p><p>Damian was the most sentimental of them all. He had been there from the very beginning, having seen the second personality of Kyle take over Alvin. Previously, he had an issue with the new personality taking over Alvin’s body, but as he watched the meteoric rise of the Seven Snakes over the months, he was not sure if he even wanted Alvin back at all. Hell, if Alvin’s main personality ever resurfaced, Damian would be the first one to beat it out of him and try to get Kyle back. </p><p><em>Seniors, mentors, First Leader Theorin. The Seven Snakes have returned to their rightful position. </em>Damian sniffled slightly as he rubbed his nose, getting emotional.</p><p>Guang Hwa, on the other hand, was unfazed by all the obvious emotional signs that everyone else was showing. <em>I got fucking enslaved by Kyle. Why would I be happy he’s getting stronger?! Fuck!</em></p><p>“We have suffered setbacks and obstacles, but each day, it is us that have prevailed, that have overcome every enemy that stood in our way. I could not have done it without you, and I truly cherish all of you as partners in this endeavor to rise beyond our station in life.” Kyle’s tone was gentle and tinged with sincerity.</p><p>Suddenly, his face grew grim. “However, what comes next will be the toughest period of our growth. If we make it past the next year, we will be unrivaled in the South Sector for years to come. The information I am about to share with you is of the highest confidentiality—and I trust each and every one of you here.”</p><p>“The war between Versia and Count Leon is inevitable—the resolution signed between the two of them is but a farce. The reasons are unclear to me, but it is a fact that in half a year or more, Count Leon’s military will be assembled for an exercise on the outskirts of Raktor. This could be a potential spark that ignites the conflict, and thus a new phase in the economy of the South Sector. As such, I will ensure that the Seven Snakes gang is in the right position to capitalize on this situation.”</p><p>“This means that there will come a point in time where we must expand to Versia to win on both sides. For now, we will focus on strengthening our position in the South Sector, while I prepare for future plans. There will come a time where I and others will leave the Seven Snakes in all of your capable hands. Hence, you all will have to step up and ensure the Seven Snakes are on track. And don’t you even think about running away.” Kyle shot a sharp glare at Guang Hwa, whose cheerful smile was immediately cut short.</p><p>“Damian, you will speed up recruiting. Establish a second layer below the vipers, known as cobras, to reward associates who have stuck with us since the beginning. Have the best of them become crew leaders, and let them operate independently in a squad hierarchy to reduce overhead administration. We need all the manpower we can get to control the districts.”</p><p>“Keith, prepare the logistics needed to build the weapons factory requested by the baron. This is the first external project that the Golden Snake Construction Company is undertaking—everything needs to go perfectly. We need workers, skilled ones who can drive the weapons factory forward in order to win the supply contract.”</p><p>“Eric, ramp up the production of alcohol and begin storing it. Once the war kicks in, alcohol is going to be highly valued in both Raktor and Versia. Every excess should be accounted for and stored in separate warehouses for future use.”</p><p>“Monica, continue to ensure that our transportation network is working as intended. Feel free to use the funds available to you to expand the fleet and our reach. Start providing regular transportation route services to underserved districts to increase our influence.”</p><p>“Adrian, start contacting black market dealers and keep up to date on any information they might have. We need to know about any event that happens as soon as it happens, no questions asked. Continue to observe the movements of the Wretches, the Red Lions and especially the Ardent Cretins. Track all their high-profile members and make sure we know exactly where they are every time.”</p><p>“Niko, you’re still in charge of security. We need our current districts to be the hallmark of safety. Ensure all our deliveries are on time. If a hijacking of our wagon occurs, make sure to report it to me immediately. Continue to protect our pubs, casinos, and brothels—no-name thug gangs may begin to eye us as easy targets as soon as we announce our project and shift manpower to build the weapons factory.”</p><p>“Gordon, your experience as the factory manager will come in handy, and you will be the overall lead for its production. The current factory will now be converted into the weapons factory. Check the documents that I will give to you later for details on what I intend for the factory to do. The larger the scale that we achieve, the more our influence and reputation will increase.”</p><p>“Speaking of reputation—Reese, you will be in charge of marketing. We want to promote a positive brand image, so work with Guang Hwa on building a public reputation for our companies and district, including the factory. All light-capture films should work towards our districts being known for stability unlike the other violent areas. This way we can pull more people over.”</p><p>Kyle continued to give a few more minor orders before concluding the meeting. “When I took over leadership, I only had one goal in mind—to grow the Seven Snakes into a power that cannot be contested.”</p><p>“Yes, not even the Ardent Cretins will be able to pin us down any longer!” Damian nodded.</p><p>“Forget about the Ardent Cretins—they are insignificant to the bigger plan in the long run. Are you truly satisfied with having just less than a quarter of a small city under your control? Do you not want to grow larger than just a few districts?”</p><p>The rest were shocked at what Kyle had just mentioned. They could barely envision themselves reigning at the top of Raktor. Sure, Damian might have daydreamed about it at some point in his life, but to actually fix it as a goal? </p><p>The word “impossible” appeared in their minds, but yet, for some reason, the very presence of Kyle seemed to defy that impossibility. He seems to be larger than life, an indomitable leader who has led them all this far beyond their wildest dreams. Who among them could imagine having gone toe-to-toe with the Ardent Cretins in an economic war and stayed standing?</p><p>“Not even the entirety of Raktor will be enough for me!” Kyle declared. “Kregol, Perial, the entire Yual Dominion shall fall under my whims alone with due time. And when I’m done with them, not even Versia, Proco, or those hiding beyond the Great Waves can escape my grip!”</p><p>The ambition of Kyle sparked a fire in their hearts, daring them to aim as high as they could. Every notion of obstacles or setbacks was thrown out of their minds, replaced by a zealous belief in Kyle and his leadership. Each of the vipers had their own mindset, but all had aligned to follow Kyle as far as the road would take them.</p><p>“And if you think that is enough for us—that we should be content with having the entire planet respect us—you are wrong. For even the stars themselves will bow before us in due time!”</p><p>
