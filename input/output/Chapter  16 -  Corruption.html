<p>Chapter  16: Corruption</h1></p><p>The arctech enforcer wagon rumbled as it crossed rugged and poorly maintained cobblestone streets, a far cry from the pristine capital of the Yual Dominion where Kitana had lived during her training. Her inquisitor partner found amusement in her uneasiness as he puffed a Euria pipe. </p><p>The blue smoke drifted across his gray beard, with each breath relaxing his tired wrinkles that seemed to mark every inch of his face. </p><p>“First time out of Tryas?” the old inquisitor joked as he stuffed more Euria Seed Powder into his pipe. </p><p>“I’m afraid so,” Kitana grumbled in reply, glancing through the back of the covered wagon. A grimy street trailed behind, with squatters half-drunk on the side of the road. </p><p>The pavement was half-covered in piss, vomit, or some other liquid. Gangs of young teenagers roamed the streets, harassing others, while dejected factory workers languished in piles of trash, blacked out from overdoses of various black market concoctions. </p><p>It was vastly different from the prim and proper feeling of the Central Sector. Here in the south, the fumes of the factories ballooned high above, while the dense streets were full of travelers, traders, mercenaries, and exiles from not just the Yual Dominion but other nations past the border as well. It was a pure melting pot of cultures, people, and the lowest of scum.</p><p>“Statistics,” Kitana muttered to herself, her eyes darting around at seemingly nothing. <em>So, I’m still level 1. I guess Mother was right about having to kill people to level up.</em> She peeked back at the streets and suppressed a smirk. She could see plenty of targets just asking to be <em>accidentally </em>killed. </p><p>She caught her partner staring at her, and she calmed herself down. <em>Better to play a zealous, naïve girl for now to stave off any suspicion. The more naïve I make myself, the better.</em></p><p>Just as the wagon passed yet another thug fight, Kitana stood up to stop the driver. The old inquisitor stood up to stop her, sitting her back down with a stern look. “Calm down, girl. Do you think you can take on all ten of them? Wait till we get to the office.”</p><p>Visibly fuming, she sat back down on her seat, glaring at her partner. His face showed no signs of anger or righteous fury. “What kind of inquisitor ignores crimes occurring against the Sanctum of Yual in front of their very eyes?” Kitana kept up the act.</p><p>“The practical kind.” He sighed. “I’ve seen plenty of people like you get killed instantly because they had no tact. Want to survive long enough to make a difference? Play it cool.”</p><p>“How the hell did you become an inquisitor?”</p><p>“Because I do my job. No more, no less.”</p><p>“Isn’t your job to punish crimes?” </p><p>“Oh, dear. This is what they get when they send such a fresh girl straight from Tryas. Listen, stay behind me and let me do most of the talking when we’re at the office, all right?” The old man continued to puff his smoke.</p><p>Kitana internally celebrated. <em>Good. Saves me the scrutiny.</em></p><p>The wagon soon stopped in front of a chapel.</p><p>“We’re here, esteemed inquisitors. Welcome to the Magda.”</p><p>The Magda was the South Sector’s enforcer headquarters—a block of buildings centered around the main chapel, providing the logistics and support necessary to each of its branches situated in each district. Thousands of cases and reports were handled here, as well as equipment procurement. </p><p>Kitana and her partner hopped out the back of the wagon, following their driver. They were led not into the chapel but into a side office building. Floors upon floors of administrative clerks handled requests for arcite ore or fuel, wagon repairs, and arctech equipment. Arctech phone lines rang non-stop at the station while stressed interns ran about with stacks of paper. The printing press shuddered violently, copies of case evidence and documentation churning out in a never-ending stream.</p><p>The two inquisitors walking through the office drew many eyes and whispers from the other enforcers, their white uniforms and decorative lapels sticking out like a sore thumb. Everyone they passed bowed to them, with the male inquisitor simply smiling and waving them off. </p><p>Soon they reached their destination—the bishop’s office. </p><p>It was a grand room with a ceiling two stories high. Bookshelves lined the walls as the light from the sunset shone through the stained glass windows, filled with depictions from the Sanctum of Yual.</p><p>“Ah, Mason. Thank Yual that they posted you here instead of that oaf Fredrinn.” The bishop smiled as she got out of her chair. Kitana noted her scarred hands as they approached the table, which was filled with piles of papers requesting her approval. </p><p>Mason chuckled as he came to a stop in front of the table, giving a half-hearted mock salute. “Inquisitor Mason and Inquisitor Kitana, at your service, Bishop Vernette.”</p><p>“This young? Are they sure about this? I would have thought the posh ones would have all remained in Tryas, or maybe been sent to a coastal city in the north,” Vernette commented as she examined Kitana from head to toe. </p><p>“Or maybe someone above has other plans for her. Who knows,” Mason replied with a half-shrug. He plopped down on the sofa to their side and retrieved his Euria pipe. “So, what’s the deal?”</p><p>“I think it’s better if I let Baron Cain do the talking. He’ll be here any minute. Would you like a drink, Kitana?” Vernette sat back in her chair, smiling gently.</p><p>“What deal are we talking about here? Are we not here to clean up the city?” Kitana ignored the offer, still playing the naïve, zealous girl. She also had to put up such an act in front of the bishop.</p><p>Vernette simply shot a fierce glare at Mason, who laughed in response. “Girl, as I said, let me do most of the talking here.”</p><p>“My name isn’t <em>girl,</em> it’s—”</p><p>Before Kitana could finish, the doors to the office swung open, with Baron Cain walking in with two knights. The baron was decked from head to toe in luxury—a posh velvet cap, a well-pressed suit adorned with jewels and initials on the cuffs, and a handkerchief sticking out of his breast pocket, nicely folded and marked with the insignia of the Yual Dominion. The knights were equally domineering, clad in arctech armor with engravings all over the painted metal. </p><p>“Ah, my requested inquisitors have finally arrived.” Cain smiled with open arms as he did not bow or salute any of them. He strutted across the room, and with a loud plop, he sat comfortably on the sofa next to Mason. The bishop and the two inquisitors immediately stood up and bowed with respect. </p><p>The nobility was far higher than those in the religious order, so even Bishop Vernette had to bow. Someone had to pay the budget.</p><p>“Hmm… You seem familiar,” Cain remarked as he took a closer look at Mason. </p><p>“Yes, sir. I’ve worked here with your father on a different operation in this city a decade or so ago. Inquisitor Mason at your service. Though I won’t claim to know the intricacy of the underground any longer,” Mason said respectfully.</p><p>“Ah! Then you’re the best man for the job. The nature of this operation is the same as before, and I’m sure you’ll meet a lot of old faces. I have a party to attend in an hour, so let’s get right to it. You two, bring out the map.”</p><p>The knights walked into the center of the office, unrolling a map of the city that had already been marked with red lines and red stars indicating points of interest. “Unlike other sectors in Raktor, the south is relatively stable. However, it is this stability that is hurting my finances. I take it you understand, Mason?” Baron Cain raised his eyebrows, taking note of Mason’s expression.</p><p>“Of course. You want us to rough up the current status quo. Keep them on their toes. Knock the gangs down a peg.”</p><p>“Exactly. But not too much, lest they start to move their ratholes around.” The baron held a wide grin on his face before his expression became even more solemn. </p><p><em>So, beat up the gangs a little to shake some money from their pockets. A protection racket, but run by the baron. Intriguing. </em>Kitana listened intently. </p><p>“There’s another reason I’ve asked you all to come here. There have been spies smuggling weapons out of our military factories and bases that are contracted to produce new types of guns and various classified arctech equipment. We lost a shipment a month ago, and I’m sure Bishop Vernette here recalls how that went.”</p><p>“Poorly. We didn’t find a single trace of it. Perhaps you can consider increasing the budget—twenty enforcers to a district of tens of thousands is hardly enough,” Bishop Vernette shot back. </p><p>“You can’t get military equipment out without having an insider,” Mason remarked. “If we don’t have access to the military personnel themselves, it would be difficult to clamp down on them.”</p><p>“That’s for the military to solve, not us. We don’t have the legal authority to do so anyway. However, it is clear that another organization within the South Sector is helping the insider, and I want to know who. If it’s that slimy Sebastian, I want to know immediately.”</p><p>“Sebastian is still around? Interesting.” Mason took a closer look at the map on the floor, counting the number of red stars marked. “That’s… That’s a lot of factories. Do we even have enough enforcers to cover them?”</p><p>“You don’t. I’m not planning to give you any more money until you prove your worth. Get the gangs to pay me, and maybe we can talk about increasing the budget.” </p><p>“Any leads?” Mason asked.</p><p>“None as of now,” Bishop Vernette replied in place of the baron. “But there are mild suspicions that it is the work of a foreign nation trying to steal our military technology. Or it could be neighboring Kregol and Perial trying to get the upper hand on us.”</p><p>“Those damn backwater counties are always jealous of Raktor. I have a good mind to petition the duke for a tribunal against them,” Baron Cain scoffed. “Regardless of who it is, under no circumstances can the technology be leaked any more, especially if it’s being sold to the civilian population. That last shipment was the final straw. Other barons have already increased checkpoints and security at the exits and entrances of the city.”</p><p>“I don’t understand. We’re here to protect some random factories instead of cleaning up the city?” Kitana interrupted the baron, her naïve, zealous act on full display. “From what I’ve seen on my way here, this entire sector is a lawless place! If you knew about it, you would have raised the budget immediately.”</p><p>Cain was slightly taken aback before an incredulous expression took over his face as he glanced between Mason and Vernette, who simply shook their heads in response. </p><p>“What? Why the fuck has everyone been hiding stuff from me ever since I got here?” Kitana challenged the three of them.</p><p>“Mason, could you please do the honors?” Cain gestured with his hands. </p><p>“Yes, sir.” Mason bowed, sternly walking up to Kitana. </p><p>“Wha—” Mason’s fist connected with Kitana’s face, the sound of her cheekbone cracking from the blunt force resounding in the silent room. Before she could stumble backward, Mason grabbed her by the uniform’s collar and kicked the back of her knees, forcing her to kneel in front of the baron. </p><p>Kitana groaned in pain as she held her broken nose, her mind spinning as blood trickled down through the seams between her fingers, staining the carpet. “What’s her name?” Cain asked Vernette.</p><p>“It’s Kitana, sir. I’m afraid she’s fresh from Tryas.”</p><p>“Fresh from Tryas… Well then.” Cain got up, patting his suit down before standing in front of her. “One rule to learn during your short, pitiful life here: don’t you ever fucking talk back to me. I pay the bills around here, so I’m the law. Got it? As for the rest of you, I expect to see results.” Cain spat on her head before leaving with the two knights. </p><p>The moment he left, Mason immediately took out a Health Potion and stuffed it in Kitana’s mouth, forcing her to drink it. The green aura slowly mended her face, but the blood stains remained. </p><p>“Girl, I already told you to leave the talking to me. What were you thinking, shouting like that?” Mason sighed as he let Kitana rest on the floor. </p><p>“Mason,” the bishop started. “If she doesn’t change, she’s quickly going to die here. You know someone above is counting on that.”</p><p>Kitana was still conscious, but delirious. “Who? Who is going to kill me?”</p><p>“Don’t you know why some fresh graduating inquisitors are sent to Raktor?” Mason asked, offering a hand to help her up. “It’s usually because of three things. One, you’re too talkative. Two, you’re too zealous. Three, you’re too naïve. And as far as I can tell, you’re all three.”</p><p><em>Might be true for the other nine, but they don’t know I’m the only one who volunteered myself because it’s where the most action happens… legally. </em></p><p>Kitana grumbled as she stood upright, slapping away the hand offered by Mason. “You’re telling me they trained me to be an inquisitor so I can look the other way? I still don’t understand what the fuck is the purpose of us coming here!”</p><p>Mason suddenly pulled out an arctech pistol, aiming it right at Kitana. Her training instinctively kicked in, with her trying to draw her pistol as well. However, her pistol was missing.</p><p>“Recognize this?” Mason motioned with his head to the pistol, which was clearly nicked from her. </p><p>“The truth is you’re a young, naïve, half-baked inquisitor who was sent here to die. Do you know why they don’t have to assassinate you? Because based on your current attitude, you would have died in less than a day on the streets of Raktor. You can’t even defend yourself or keep your pistol secured—what hope do you have against the gangs?” Mason berated her. “If I kill you right now, it would be a mercy.”</p><p>The sound of the arctech pistol’s safety being clicked frightened Kitana; her heart pounded as she stared at the barrel aimed at her forehead. Mason’s hand suddenly jerked, causing her to flinch instinctively. Opening her eyes slowly, she saw that Mason had tossed the pistol on the floor instead. </p><p>“Your safety was off,” Mason remarked as he sat back down on the sofa. “Look. I will do everything in my power to keep you alive for the duration of this operation. Once this is over, you can return to your zealous, holier-than-thou solo crusade and kill yourself for all I care. At least it’ll be off my record. Follow me, and I’ll train you to survive. Do we have a deal?”</p><p>Kitana nodded. “What are we going to do about protecting the factories? We don’t have enough bodies to cover all of them.”</p><p>“I heard there are a few organizations around this sector that specialize in protection; let’s knock down some doors tomorrow with a bit of lethal force, maybe talk with Sebastian. For now, get some rest.”</p><p>The two of them were shown to their quarters, a luxurious studio apartment. Kitana checked the room before closing the curtains, ensuring no one was spying on her. </p><p>She nearly couldn’t stop grinning as she checked her statistics again. <em>I was right to choose Raktor—I’m going to surpass my siblings within a year. With this much EXP running around the streets, who can stop me now?</em><h1><a id="_82k2qaojxnyw"></a>
