<p>Chapter  13: Assault</h1></p><p><em>A few days later…</em></p><p>“Boss, all our men are waiting for your orders.”</p><p>“Good.” Wrent nodded his head, wearing his reddish armor set. He strode out to the training yard where more than forty members were all lined up in formation under the evening sky. They each had a light armor set, but only four of them had arctech on them, which was the sign of the squad leaders. Each squad had ten members standing in neat rows.</p><p>“The Seven Snakes have been rapidly growing over the last two weeks. On top of that, they are still holding our men! As such, from today, we will be entering a state of war against them. Each squad is to target one of the major businesses immediately.”</p><p>Wrent held up a printed piece of paper with a rough sketch of Kyle’s face. “If you encounter the leader of the Seven Snakes, Kyle, retreat at once. Do not attempt to engage alone. The objective is to wear them down and split their forces. He is the only one among them who has any sort of combat training. The rest are weak idiots.”</p><p>Wrent knew this war had a chance of being dragged out. If they failed the first assault, they had to wear them down slowly over time.</p><p>The Red Lions had been using the Stamina Potions, but not all of them. Wrent kept more than four hundred of them in a protected area near the armory. However, he wasn’t worried about an attack on the base, seeing as he was here to defend it. This allowed him to maximize his attacking force, which he needed if he wanted to hold a numerical advantage over the Seven Snakes.</p><p>He passed a single arctech radio to each of the squad leaders. This way, Wrent would be able to monitor the situation, and the squad leaders could convey information to one another. Information was the key to winning everything—Wrent knew that well.</p><p>“These are precious pieces of equipment loaned to us by the main base. Don’t you dare lose it! Even if you die, your ghost must return this to me. Understood?”</p><p>The squad leaders nodded grimly. </p><p>“A few days, a week, two weeks—we will not rest until the Seven Snakes have capitulated and returned our comrades. The Red Lions never falter in the face of adversity. BEGIN!”</p><p>“Yes, Boss!” The squads began to move out, heading to their designated locations.</p><p>Wrent smiled to himself as he retreated into his office. <em>You may be smart, but the nail that sticks out will get hammered down first. It’s just business.</em> He was already internally salivating at the thought of taking over their potion production process, wondering what other secrets the Seven Snakes held on to.</p><p>An hour passed, approaching dusk. The arctech streetlights began to flicker on, their bright, blue lights illuminating the dusty cobblestone roads. The first squad reached the brothel first, but they soon noticed that the Seven Snakes associates were already out in force, with seven guys guarding the nearby streets.</p><p><em>“Boss, they seemed to be onto us,”</em> a squad leader reported through the radio.</p><p><em>“It’s expected.”</em> Wrent was calm, already having expected Kyle to be prepared in advance. <em>“When all squads are in position, we’ll attack simultaneously.”</em></p><p>Another ten minutes passed before all four squads were in position. The brothel, two pubs, and a restaurant were being targeted, but the squads reported seeing associates of the Seven Snakes in the vicinity.</p><p>“Any sign of Kyle?”</p><p><em>“No, Boss. But there seems to be more associates than the twenty expected. Closer to thirty or even more now.”</em></p><p>This didn’t faze Wrent at all<em>. If I’m right, he’s probably waiting at the base or somewhere in the middle where he can rapidly respond to any attacks. And the new recruits barely had a week or two for training.</em> “Move in now.”</p><p>The squads slowly began moving into the district, positioning aggressively and standing near the targeted businesses. The customers who were initially beginning to queue up began to scatter upon seeing the threatening Red Lions members stare at them from a distance. Word began to spread around like wildfire—it was a turf war.</p><p>One of the Seven Snakes’ guards began to confront them. “Hey! What are you red cunts trying here? You’re fucking scaring them off!”</p><p>“I’ll stand wherever the fuck I like. Why? Does your father own these streets? Didn’t know this was your grandfather’s road either. Mind your own business.”</p><p>“You better fucking move, or—”</p><p>“Or what? Run and hide, like you always did with Ulon? Once a bitch, always a bitch.”</p><p>All over the district, confrontations like this were beginning to drive the tension even higher. The Red Lions were provoking the Seven Snakes to attack first. It was all a childish back-and-forth of who attacked first and who was in the right, a game of public perception as a few brave onlookers watched the arguments grow more heated.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, it wouldn’t matter who started the fight or waved the biggest stick—only who won. Wrent was about to lean back into his comfortable office chair, waiting for the inevitable victory, when he suddenly heard a loud thud in the training yard before a metal door cracked open with a repeated hammering sound.</p><p>The grating metallic sounds pierced the air, prompting Wrent to immediately exit the office to see who was attacking. A lone man was smacking away at the hinges of the armory door with a neon-red arctech hammer, and they soon gave way, sending the door to the ground with a large cloud of dust.</p><p>“KYYYYYLLE!” Wrent lunged at him, retrieving his ruby-encrusted sword from its sheath and swinging wildly. However, the arctech shoes Kyle wore glowed yellow and allowed him to move a bit faster than expected, barely dodging the ferocious attacks. Kyle quickly ran into the armory, glancing around at the numerous racks of weapons and armor before spotting the potion crates.</p><p>A tingling sensation ran down his spine as he instinctively ducked, a red energy arc slicing through the air where his head had just been. The arc crashed into the potion crates with a loud explosion, sending dark-yellow liquid spiraling into the air.</p><p><em>That’s new.</em></p><p>Kyle glanced behind Wrent to see a pipe connected to a churning fuel pack at his waist and a sword glowing with arcia. “So, you’ve come to your death, then. Were you planning on raiding the armory to steal our equipment?” Wrent grinned, blocking the only exit.</p><p>Without a word, Kyle ran deeper inside, much to the surprise of Wrent.</p><p>“COME BACK HERE, YOU CUNT!” Wrent yelled as he charged through the armory. Kyle quickly used his hammer to smack the intersections of a few empty armor racks and tossed training weapons to stall Wrent. The well-organized armory started collapsing, the metal shelves and cupboards being overturned.</p><p>Wrent’s armor prevented him from moving as fast as Kyle, rendering him unable to keep up. Kyle leapt over him with one swift motion, landing in a roll. As soon as he recovered, he ran straight out the door. </p><p>“STOP RIGHT THERE!” Wrent yelled.</p><p>Kyle didn’t comply, only showing a small smirk before leaving, which infuriated Wrent even more. Wrent glanced around the room, seeing only an utter mess. No critical equipment was being kept here; all of it had already been distributed to the attacking squads. He tried to figure out Kyle’s objective, since the man was clearly avoiding a fight with him.</p><p>The dark-yellow liquid oozing onto the floor suddenly made him realize he had lost the entire stash of potions. The loss of the Stamina Potions weighed on him, but his pride mattered more. How could he have failed to capture the enemies’ leader when he was right there? He ran back to the office and grabbed the radio.</p><p>“Cease the attack and converge back on the base—Kyle is fleeing back through our district! Cut him off!”</p><p><em>“Boss, we can’t. We’re right in front of them. If we back off now, our reputation will take a hit!”</em></p><p>“Aren’t they pushovers? Just attack first, knock out a few of them, and then catch the leader!”</p><p>The Red Lions squads were now torn between leaving a confrontation they started and capturing Kyle. “Fuck it. If Wrent ordered it, we’ll do it!”</p><p>They quickly began to attack, but none of the Seven Snakes members were surprised, knowing their plan had succeeded. “Hold as many of them here! Don’t let them cut off our leader!”</p><p>Battles erupted in the street, the flickering of the arctech neon signs serving as the backdrop to dozens of men that fought in the streets in a rough melee brawl with fists, gauntlets, knuckle dusters, and pipes. Blood and the twisting of limbs became a common scene all over the cobblestone ground, with fighters wrestling and ganging up on single targets. Everything was fair game.</p><p>Much to the surprise of the Red Lions, the Seven Snakes were suddenly much better at fighting. They were able to dodge and parry effectively, to a certain extent. It was not only the effect of the homemade Strength Potions that boosted them. They had undergone training since Kyle had taken over, which was now close to a month for the original members, much like a boot camp.</p><p>Any of the Red Lions members who tried to carry out Wrent’s order were instantly intercepted by the Seven Snakes. However, the Red Lions still had the edge in arctech equipment and experience, allowing them to inflict more damage as the battle continued. The fights were brutal, with both sides suffering injuries and broken limbs.</p><p><em>“Boss, they aren’t that weak; we can’t beat them instantly like we expected!”</em></p><p>Wrent cursed and pounded his fist on his office table, cracking it in half. “ARRRGH! SEVEN SNAKES!” He couldn’t leave the base lest Kyle was performing a feint—there were still plenty of high-value resources that Kyle could quickly return to ransack.</p><p>The scale of the fights began to escalate, with exhaustion setting in. But the Seven Snakes were far more tenacious, gritting their teeth as they pushed back against the numerical and equipment disadvantages. “This is nothing compared to our training!”</p><p>The next hour was harrowing as the fights dragged on. Wrent impatiently tapped the table, waiting for some good news over the arctech radio. All of a sudden, one of the lights indicating an active connection to a squad dimmed. <em>Shit… One of the squads had their arctech radio broken?! It has to be Kyle!</em></p><p>With a squad out of contact, it meant that the net he had set up around the Seven Snakes’ district had fallen apart. Wrent’s brow furrowed intensely as he contemplated whether or not he should enter the battle himself to counter Kyle’s combat ability. However, he instinctively knew that he was now one step behind; entering the battle would be playing right into the enemies’ hand. </p><p>“All squads, retreat now!” Wrent ordered, aiming to conserve his forces. <em>I must cut my losses and reorganize before it’s too late!</em></p><p>The Red Lions were more than happy to comply, immediately retreating and limping away.</p><p>The Seven Snakes did not chase them, instead letting them retreat slowly. They themselves did not go unscathed, having suffered a few injuries and concussions far worse than the Red Lions. The potions helped them with the grit to stay standing after the brutal clash.</p><p><em>Should I call for reinforcements from the main base?</em> The brief thought flashed through Wrent’s mind when he realized he was now on an even playing field with the Seven Snakes, and may have even lost. Even if half of them returned, he had no Stamina Potions left to give them.</p><p>He shuddered when he thought of how the boss of the Red Lions would react if he asked for help. The main base had problems of their own when fighting other gangs, and if Wrent admitted he couldn’t handle a small-time group like the Seven Snakes, he could forget about climbing the ranks. <em>My position as the Left Paw would be stripped regardless of victory. I’ll have to do this myself.</em></p><p>Eventually, the squads returned, including the one that had lost the radio. They had to leave three of their members behind while the other squads returned intact but still wounded.</p><p>“W-What happened to our potions?!” a returning squad member exclaimed upon seeing the mess of broken crates and liquid on the floor.</p><p>Wrent didn’t respond, inwardly cursing himself for not protecting it to the best of his ability. He took out a secret stash of Health Potions, distributing them to the squad leaders.</p><p>“One squad will keep guard and patrol the district lest the Seven Snakes try to attack while we’re weak. Rotate every eight hours. All other squads are to sleep.” Wrent knew they needed to rest if he wanted to have a shot at winning at all.</p><p>With the assault failing, they had now entered a protracted conflict stage.<h1><a id="_wk2hzybq4s1p"></a>
