<p>Chapter  61 - Advertisement</strong></p><p>The torrential rain soaked the earth of the Culdao Peaks, the soil and roots turning into sludge as birds and animals alike took shelter. Some relished in the water, but soon, a thunderous cacophony of pitter-patter could be heard off in the distance, a solemn drum beating in rhythm with the tired gasp of goblin soldiers marching.</p><p>&lt; That accursed Gulak, forcing me to come out to this backwater area! &gt; A small but well-shaven goblin envoy with smooth emerald-like skin and a lavish attire grumbled on his palanquin. The burdensome weight was hoisted high by four goblins who struggled under the weight of the ornate design and other ‘necessities’ the envoy had deemed essential for the trip.</p><p>The front and back of the procession were guarded by a dozen goblin soldiers each, while twenty servant goblins lugged large empty woven baskets on their sweaty backs, their contents empty in preparation for the tribute.</p><p>A strong gust of wind buffeted the troops, the rain crashing into the envoy sideways and wetting its chair and silk-like garments, causing his face to scrounge up in sheer irritation. &lt; Are we within a hundred steps yet?! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Yes, sire! &gt; A servant goblin responded with a quick bow. </p><p>&lt; Halt! &gt; The envoy held up its right hand, the procession stopping. &lt; Send forth the messengers. Have Gulak prostrate before me! &gt;</p><p>Three goblin soldiers acting as messengers moved forward, armed to the teeth with an iron spear and a sword, while the envoy waited with anticipation. <em>That damn Gulak! If only he had just provided tribute on time, I wouldn’t have to come out all the way here! Let’s see his face when I raise the tribute requirements!</em> A wide grin appeared on the envoy’s face, its sharp yellowing front teeth bared for all to see, hardly concealing its excitement.</p><p>The envoy raised yet another hand, beckoning one of the veteran hobgoblins under his command to approach the palanquin. &lt; Have the soldiers prepare for a raid! &gt; The hobgoblin stood tall, nearly human height, yet he bowed to the diminutive envoy in obedience.</p><p>&lt; Sire, are we not here to collect tribute from a loyal goblin tribe?! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Loyal? They have missed the final deadline for tribute offering to Sahusa, our great King! This is unacceptable and an affront to the unity of the goblin kingdom. Do you understand? &gt;</p><p>&lt; … yes, sire. &gt; The veteran hobgoblin did not fancy going to war with their own tributary but complied with the order anyway.</p><p>Noticing the hesitation apparent on the veteran’s face, the envoy sighed. &lt; If we do not teach a lesson now, then how will the kingdom survive when every damn tribe delays their tribute! Our economy is already on the brink – if we do not collect the tribute, rationing will have to begin soon. &gt;</p><p>&lt; Understood, sire. &gt;</p><p>However, before the veteran could make a move, a howl of pain could be heard in the distance, from the direction of the goblin den. The envoy squinted its eyes, only to see a ragged and bleeding messenger running back to them. Arrow shafts stuck out of its skin like a pin cushion, making the others wonder how the messenger was still even able to run.</p><p>&lt; Who's attacking us?! &gt; The envoy called out in shock, sitting upright and trying to see what the messenger was running from.</p><p>The messenger barely seemed to have registered the envoy’s call, instead running right past the procession with all haste, screaming its lungs out with abandon. A wave of fear struck the soldiers of the procession as they watched the injured messenger disappear into the forest behind them, making them wonder what kind of danger the messenger encountered.</p><p>&lt; What’s going on?! How dare they fight back? &gt; The envoy was enraged – the arrows in the messengers were clearly of goblin-make, which meant Gulak had attacked his messengers. &lt; Prepare for subjugation of this infidels! &gt;</p><p>It was then that the source of the messenger’s fear appeared in front of them, a lone human woman bearing an ornate crossbow in one hand and the corpse of a goblin messenger in the other, its heart clearly ripped out by the woman's bloodied hands.</p><p>&lt; Human?! What is a human doing here? &gt;</p><p>&lt; She tortured him! The tribe of Gulak has already fallen to the humans! &gt;</p><p>&lt; It’s a trap! &gt;</p><p>A wave of panic spread through the soldiers as they saw their comrade’s corpse, some of the more timid servants immediately throwing their baskets to the ground and fleeing the procession.</p><p>&lt; Stand your ground, you fools! What can a human do to the great kingdom of Sahusa? We've beaten them back before, and we'll do it again! &gt; The envoy rallied the troops, but it was to no avail. With each step the human woman took towards them, the shivering and the fright spread even more through the two dozen goblin soldiers who each now faced an internal turmoil on whether to fight or retreat.</p><p>The veteran hobgoblin stood steadfast, taking up point with a spear and shield. His presence did nothing more than to hold the soldiers together precariously. But before he could even give an order, a single goblin arrow shot right through the gap between his helmet and his chest armor, embedding itself in the windpipe.</p><p>That was all it took for the goblins to scream and scatter completely, their fear infectious as they fled in all directions. The palanquin was unceremoniously thrown to the floor, and the four servant goblins were unwilling to sacrifice their lives for their envoy.</p><p>&lt; Come back this instant, or you shall be executed for desertion! &gt; The envoy shrieked at the top of his lungs, but the threat of the law did not pose any burden for the retreating goblins, leaving the envoy to face down the human woman alone.</p><p>The goblin arrow had not been shot by her, but by attacking goblin archers posted in the trees as scouts. The envoy gasped at the sight of the goblins acting like elves, a natural disgust rising up in his throat. &lt; You… have all of you been corrupted? How dare you scurry around like rats on trees? &gt;</p><p>&lt; Better to be on a tree than a rat struggling in the mud like you. &gt;</p><p>The envoy squinted once more, spotting Gulak behind the human woman with a wide grin. &lt; Gulak! You! How dare you collude with humans! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Life is much better here than ever before, Erasg! As our guest of honor, you should come and visit to see for yourself! &gt;</p><p>The implications were clear to the envoy, who quickly scrambled for a weapon. Grabbing a dropped sword nearby, it quickly aimed it at its own heart and was about to thrust deep before the human woman lunged forward, kicking the sword away.</p><p>With a strong grip, the human woman grasped the goblin by the neck, lifting it up high. The eerie silence of the human woman worried the envoy even more than Gulak’s ecstatic cackling. <em>By the ancestors, may King Sahusa and the Oracle protect our kingdom…</em></p><p>@@@</p><p>“Here we are at the South Sector, who we-uh…. At one of the…” A homely girl stuttered while staring blankly at a light-capturer with a confused expression, scrounged up in desperation as she tried to remember her lines.</p><p>“Okay, okay, cut!” Reese waved his hands frantically, stopping the recording. A few sighs left the crew on site, sweltering under the intense heat as they hoisted lighting equipment and supplies for the filming. Yet none of them dared to utter a word to the obviously flustered girl, her bumbling stutter somehow a point of endearment that washed away their anger. Her intricate dress and tight-fitting skirt only increased their threshold of annoyance, her beauty a sight for sore eyes despite her various mistakes.</p><p>“Okay, Emily, breathe, focus. Breathe, alright? ” Reese calmly spoke to the flustered girl.</p><p>“Sorry, Mr. Reese, I forgot my lines; it’s my first time doing this!” Emily apologized furiously, bowing so low her dainty hat nearly fell to the floor.</p><p>“No, no, no, it’s okay. It’s everyone’s first time doing such a project. Now don’t you worry about a mistake or two! Let’s try again, and if you need to go slow, just go slowly, alright?”</p><p>Emily nodded vigorously, patting her dress down while quickly resuming back into position in front of the light-capturer, her opulent layered skirt elegantly trailing on the smooth stone tiles of the arcade’s outer plaza. The surrounding onlookers conversely were dressed in far shabbier clothing, some even only sporting a rough overall made from grain sacks while kids ran around half-naked under the blistering sun, uncaring of the heat. Versian migrants and Raktor citizens alike watched with hushed tones, mesmerized by the silhouette of the stunning beauty that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. </p><p>“Who is that, is she a noble?” A local whispered to a stranger nearby. “How did they get the nobles to work with them?”</p><p>“Idiot, don’t move! If you move while that demonic light-capturer is aimed at you, your soul will be taken away!” The stranger chided, himself stiffening up as he saw the light-capturer sweep past them. </p><p>“I think it’s a noble from another county. Has to be!” Another local assured the people around him with great confidence. Unfortunately, none of it were even remotely close to the truth. If Reese had told them that she used to be a worker at the Lusty Arcian under the care of Slavin, not a single soul would believe him.</p><p>Except Kyle, of course.</p><p>“3,2,1 and GO!”</p><p>&quot;Here we are, in the South Sector at one of the hottest spots of the year - the Golden Snakes Shopping Arcade! I am your presenter for this show - Emily Bourton, and we'll be giving you a tour of the area and showing you exactly how much progress has been accomplished here!&quot; She stepped out of the way to reveal a stunning shot of the Golden Snakes shopping arcade, complete with an expansive foyer and square where hundreds of locals were gathered, soaking in the sun near a central fountain and enjoying themselves. Most of them stared in confusion at the newfangled light-capturer, while some of the more cheeky children waved their grimy hands at Emily, who smiled back.</p><p>She spun around on her heels, her skirt billowing in the wind as a wave of admiration enveloped the crowd of onlookers. &quot;For this grand tour, I'll be accompanied by the one and only Inquisitor Mason! Inquisitor Mason, please introduce yourself to our lovely audience!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hi I am... uhm.... I.... I.... what was I supposed to say again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;CUT, CUT, CUT!&quot; Reese hollered, slapping his own chair in a sudden outburst far different from how Emily was treated. A collective groan erupted from the crew, their attitude vastly more aggressive in nature. A few onlookers sniggered and jeered at the obviously photo-shy Mason, who glared back at them while tapping his embellished inquisitor cap as a reminder of what he could do to them. That stifled most of the crowd in an instant.</p><p>Reese, on the other hand, was on the verge of pulling out his already thinning hair, the level of frustration impeccable. &quot;This... AHHHHH! What the hell is wrong with you?! How can a man like you fuck up on this level?&quot;</p><p>Mason gritted his teeth, his chest rising in anger as he began to storm up to Reese. &quot;Hey, what the hell is this? This is my first mistake! How come Emily can fuck up twenty times but-&quot;</p><p>&quot;See?! I need that, I need that confidence WHEN we're running the light-capturer, NOT after! You know what? I don't give a shit if you're an inquisitor or not, and I'm going to treat you like a dumb kid. Even my daughter can perform better than you! Hey, YOU! Yea, you! Find some large presentation paper and write his lines big. Real big. Yea, NOW! Get them off the printing presses nearby, I don't care!&quot;</p><p>Mason was about to protest about the apparent disparity in treatment when suddenly someone patted him on the arm, nearly prompting him to attack on instinct. Instead, he saw a nicely manicured feminine hand, far different from the usual grimy ones of thugs trying to ambush him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Mister Mason! You got this! Let’s do it!” Emily gave a cheerful smile along with a cute little thumbs-up, the indignant rage within Mason melting away like frozen water on a comet.</p><p>&quot;Uhh, yes... of course of course.&quot; Mason muttered non-committingly, adjusting his sleeves and collar properly.</p><p>Reese held back on the rest of his rant, his own anger mellowed out by the cuteness radiated by Emily. The annoyed crew were also appeased, their spirits somehow uplifted by the homely girl who was a sheer bundle of endless energy. Soon, one of the crew returned with a big signboard freshly printed. &quot;Now, you have no excuse to forget your lines. Your lines are right here. Before the rest of the crew comes back, I want you to practice so you stop wasting your time and my time, got it? Try it now!&quot;  Reese grunted.</p><p>The signboard was placed near the light-capturer like a cue card, with Mason muttering the lines to himself over and over again, his hands clearly fidgeting from the stage fright.</p><p>&quot;Good!&quot; Reese clapped his hands, signaling yet another re-run as Emily and the crew returned. &quot;Last chance; otherwise, I'm going to tell Bishop Vernette!”</p><p>“Why do you make it sound like she’s my mom?! I’m forty years old, for Yual’s sake!”</p><p>“Then you better act your damn age, or else I'll get my daughter to replace you. Even my grandmother can act better than you. ACTION!&quot;</p><p>Mason instantly straightened his back, dusting off his sliver pauldrons and fluttering his inquisitor coat. &quot;Hi everyone, I'm Mason, and thanks for having me on. It's my pleasure to show off what the enforcers have aimed for and achieved here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Awesome! Let's get started!&quot; Emily put on a cheerful smile, instantly carrying the fliming with sheer confidence. &quot;But, Inquisitor Mason, before we begin, I noticed that there's something strange here. Something feels off!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed, maybe a few intellectuals or long-time locals in the audience might be able to tell. It has something to do with the streets; look how many people there are and its condition.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow, you're right! They are spotless, immaculately so! And there's not a homeless person in sight - how is this possible?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's the secret to the success story of the districts so far - the enforcers of the Sanctum of Yual have been hard at work, collaborating with the Golden Snakes Construction Company to provide free housing for everyone in the area, ensuring a stable living environment for all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Free housing? That sounds too good to be true!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, because there are a few simple conditions one would need to achieve before being able to enjoy this new housing project. Contrary to first impressions, the housing built is owned by the Golden Snakes Construction Company, which has placed a requirement for all residents to hold a job in this district.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Holding a job here? But that's hard in today's economy, and some might even say that there are no jobs at all!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Naturally, if we place such a requirement, we also have provided the means with which to fulfill that benchmark.&quot; Mason was getting into the groove now, speaking far more naturally than before. &quot;The Golden Snakes Construction Company provides more than ample jobs, with more than a thousand openings available on a daily and monthly basis. Not only that, other companies in the district are ramping up their operations, and manpower is in short supply.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Great news for people looking for employment and a brighter future ahead!&quot; Emily nodded, her joyful expression instilling confidence in Mason.</p><p>&quot;As for their families, the housing provided is large enough to accommodate a family of five, as long as one works according to his ability.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Brilliant, they can bring all their loved ones over as well! But are there enough amenities around here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, there are! Let's take a tour of the Golden Snakes Shopping Arcade now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And CUT! Well done! Move to the next set, quick!&quot; Reese ordered the crew, hurriedly scrambling with the equipment in tow into the shopping arcade, where the temperature control delivered the perfect climate, cooling all of them down.</p><p>The shopping arcade was a bustle of activity, with the crowd of onlookers naturally jostling into the corridors and blocking paths. A few scuffles broke out between angry customers and irritated shop owners. “HEY! NO WAITING OUTSIDE THE SHOP! YOU’RE BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE!”</p><p>Many of them shifted unwillingly, but still fought for a place to get a glimpse of the beautiful Emily, who seemed to have a certain charm of sorts, one that Reese planned to utilize to its best effect.</p><p>As the crew set up again in the expansive corridor along the shops, Reese fiddled with the light-capturer, peering through the scope and checking the angles. He tried lugging it around, hauling it on his shoulder, struggling to move with its sheer weight due to his old age. Even the crew members were unable to move it much, requiring at least two people to handle it. <em>I can’t dedicate two of them just to moving the light-capturer; I should design a mobile version.</em></p><p>He glanced around, peering through the numerous onlookers and trying to find a better solution. He suddenly noticed Damian munching on a seasoned boiled potato in a nearby tuck shop without a care in the world, unbothered by the commotion all around him. &quot;Damian! Damian!&quot; Reese waved frantically, jumping up and down.</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Damian stared blankly around in confusion until Reese shoved his way through the crowd to grab him. “I’m off duty now. Get Niko if you need security.”</p><p>&quot;Get over here! Quickly! I need your help!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, why? What's wrong?&quot; Damian hurriedly stuffed the remainder of his potato into his mouth, rushing over, thinking that Reese was in some trouble.</p><p>Instead, the light-capturer was placed onto his broad shoulders, with two crew members struggling to tighten a harness across his thick burly chest. &quot;Damian, I need you to walk slowly with them and keep the light-capturer stable. Hold it tightly, don’t slouch and remain steady as much as possible. Got it?&quot;</p><p>“But I was just about to eat one more pota-“</p><p>A glare from Reese imparted the importance of the event onto Damian, who quickly nodded with a slight hint of confusion until he noticed Mason and Emily preparing up in front of him, ready for the next segment. &quot;Okay, okay, I’ll do it!”</p><p>&quot;Alright, lighting on!&quot; A few handheld arctech spotlights blasted the two of them, the glare visible in their pupils along with the crew shoving a few persistent bystanders aside out of the view.&quot;3,2,1 and GO!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So we're inside the Golden Snakes Shopping Arcade now, what do you think?&quot; Mason started off, reading off the cue card intently with sheer concentration.</p><p>&quot;I think it's brilliant and amazing. One of the better places to be in the South Sector for sure!&quot; Emily happily skipped over to the nearby tuck shop, motioning at the queue of people lining up for their meal, most of which instantly turned around and hid, many still believing in the more esoteric properties of the light-capturer, albeit with a tinge of shyness and embarrassment.</p><p>&quot;There's a proper weather-conditioned area to eat in peace and comfort, and if you got a bad stomach or something getting you down? Right opposite here is a certified Alchemist Guild store - but it's not your average one: it's a cheaper version! It's not as effective as a proper potion, yet it still gets the job done.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And sometimes that is all one needs. Rest, entertainment, and relaxation are what really heal you. Everything you need is right here at the shopping arcade - you have clothiers, florists, toymakers, and cafes. Up above, we have the light-thrower theatre, one of the best entertainment in town today save for a talking pig. All of these can be done safely without the fear of pickpockets and criminals.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why is that, Inquisitor Mason?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have enforcers posted in the area 24/7, and of course, with the help of the Golden Snakes Construction Company, we are able to monitor and ensure the dignity and safety of everyone in this region alone. The enforcers are looking at expanding these operations, but it will be some time until the end of our test run. I believe this shows the critical importance of the Sanctum of Yual in delivering a better future for all citizens and that we are committed to making life better in Raktor.&quot;</p><p>The recording continued on, with Damian tirelessly following the two around, with a few attempts to eat on the job. The rest of the shopping arcade was shown in detailed sequence before proceeding to the new housing units, ten-story high buildings with multiple apartments per floor, an oddity amidst the more decrepit shacks just in the other district.</p><p>&quot;And for those thinking that it is your average boarding house, with the usual chilling winds coming in through the pockmarked roof, think again!&quot; Emily grinned for the light-capturer as she opened a door to a showroom, where the apartment was neatly furnished with the basics, the walls painted with a nice clean white finish, the furniture simple but efficient. &quot;One apartment can host you and your family quite comfortably. Much better than being out on the streets!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, and what's more, the Golden Snakes Construction Company has pledged to expand housing by another five blocks in this district alone, accounting for almost six thousand apartments. It would be the biggest housing project in the South Sector alone!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's incredible! But Inquisitor Mason, with only a thousand jobs available in with the Golden Snakes Construction Company, how can the apartments be filled up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sure many have heard the news of a new weapons factory opening up in this district, co-owned by both Baron Cain and the Golden Snakes Construction Company. This and other affiliate companies are also eligible for free housing as long as they hold a job in this area. And for those who think they do not possess the qualifications, listen up close: a trade school is about to open in a few months.&quot;</p><p>Emily gasped with an obviously fake astonished expression before turning to the light-capturer with a photogenic smile. &quot;That's right, all; this district is about to become the new shining star of the South Sector - what are all of you waiting for? Apply today!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And perfect - DONE! Good job, everyone, that's all for today.&quot; Reese hollered.</p><p>“Thank you all! Thank you, Mister Mason and Mr. Reese!” Emily bowed with humility multiple times, earning the hearts of the crew as they cheered and applauded.</p><p>Mason adjusted his collars and sleeves, nodding at Emily’s appreciation as he clapped along. The applause and cheering went on for a while longer, while Reese reviewed the captured footage on a light-thrower, projecting it onto a nearby wall to see if they needed any additional shots.</p><p>“Looks like we’re good. Tomorrow, we’ll be doing the weapons factory and the other buildings.” Reese announced.</p><p>The announcement caught Mason off-guard. “Wait a minute, I don’t remember signing up for multiple runs! This was supposed to be a one-time thing!” He objected.</p><p>“If it was a one-time thing, why did you fuck it up so many times?!”</p><p>“I only fucked it up ONCE! I never - Either way, I won’t be available. I have districts to patrol!” Mason was about to turn around and walk off until he caught a glimpse of a shiny gold emblem, Reese fiddling with it in his hand. “You… how… you’re not allowed to hold onto that!”</p><p>“Oh, but I am! Under the power vested to me temporarily by the Bishop of the South Sector, Inquisitor Mason is hereby ordered to assist the Golden Snakes Construction Company until the completion of the advertisement. Also, Kyle and Bishop Vernette will be present tomorrow, so you better memorize your lines if you don’t want to look like an idiot!”</p><p><strong>
