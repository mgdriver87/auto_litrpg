<p>Chapter  64 - Regicide</strong></p><p>Sahusa the Great was not having a good time, contrary to popular belief.</p><p>It was not the fact that he was named after a myth of his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, or that the name automatically implied that he was a goblin ladykiller or that he had five arms. Of course, those made him irrationally angry as well.</p><p>But what really irked him was the bickering of the five goblin tribe leaders in front of him, which had been going on for nearly five days in a row now. And he, as the Goblin King, had to sit here and listen for hours and hours on end while surviving individual meetings with each of the tribe leaders in order to hold everything together.</p><p>&lt; King Sahusa! Are you listening to the foul words of this weakling? He should have his tongue chopped off immediately! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Just like your grandfather and your predecessor. Perhaps you should be the one to have your tongue chopped off so as to continue the tradition of insolence! &gt;</p><p>King Sahusa sighed. <em>It’s only been a year since I took over, and yet everything has gone to waste.</em> Sahusa kind of regretted assassinating his father now. He had always thought that ruling as a king was the ultimate goal, but here he was, forced to slave away and listen to old farts grumble and argue with each other.</p><p>&lt; How dare you! You take that back now! For the last four days, I have been tolerating your ill-mannered speech, but no longer! Fail to rescind your words, and there will be war! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Threatening civil war in front of the king? How daring! What can you possibly do? &gt;</p><p>&lt; SILENCE! &gt; Sahusa was enraged now, his bottled fury bursting forward as he stood up. &lt; I have listened to you old farts for long enough now! I have tried at every twist and turn to explain exactly what we need to do in order to alleviate the loss of tribute! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Bah! It’s simple! We go to war! Just like we always have! As long as we can get past the female human monster, it will be an easy win for us! Gulak and his weak tribesman can hardly fight back against us! &gt; An arrogant hobgoblin crossed his arms, flexing his muscles and the skulls mounted on his shoulder.</p><p>&lt; Osir, you’re such a fool! My scouts have seen their strength – their equipment is far beyond our comprehension! What we need to do is to negotiate and trade with them, then, we will be able to alleviate the famine that is plaguing us now. &gt; Another scrawny old tribe leader pointed out.</p><p>&lt; I agree with Elder Ulthan, we should find another human group to support us: not all humans are aligned with each other! We can use that to our advantage and gain technology like them. &gt; A third tribe leader spoke.</p><p>Osir grunted as he slammed his fist on the table, causing the entire wooden surface to reverberate &lt; Then we will be merely a proxy war, just like the Heavenly War! Have your mothers not taught you anything while you were still a child? If it were not for our ancestors, we would still be enslaved by them! &gt;</p><p>&lt; What did you say about my mother!? &gt;</p><p>&lt; SHUT UP! &gt; Sahusa interrupted the conversation, raising a scepter in his hand that was completely covered in dense engraving. The scepter seemed to amplify his voice as it glowed. The tribe leaders tried to talk but realized that their voices could not be heard by anyone but themselves.</p><p>&lt; With the power vested into me as the Goblin King, I command all five tribe leaders: This meeting shall be adjourned, and the final decision shall be made by me in three days! I will not entertain any petitions or individual meetings! &gt; King Sahusa put his foot down, before storming off out of the meeting hut</p><p>He grumbled to himself as two servants immediately fell into line behind him, keeping pace as he pushed aside the cloth marking the entrance to the meeting hut, and stepped out. The meeting hut was positioned on a cliff overlooking the expansive valley between the Culdao Peaks mountains. He stormed down a stone path carved out of the valley’s slope, leading to a small palace embedded into the mountain in a large alcove.</p><p>Sahusa sighed loudly, stopping to take a look at the valley below, where his people lived. The goblin city was large but was mostly made of mud, wood and stone mined from the mountains. They were dispersed through the long valley save for a central market area, where he could see thousands of goblins clamoring for the latest meat or cave carrots and mushrooms to eat, nearly trampling over each other or fighting non-stop.</p><p>His warriors were working around the clock to maintain the peace, but even he could tell that exhaustion would soon hit them. <em>This is not sustainable; I must find a solution immediately.</em></p><p>&lt; I will consult the Oracle now. Prepare for the ritual. &gt;</p><p>The servants gasped, looking at each other. It was a once-in-a-lifetime event to consult the Oracle – nearly no one living had seen it in person. Consulting was to be done only in the most severe of events, and the rumors running through the royal goblin palace spread like wildfire from the king’s announcement. Sahusa himself had not personally seen it, but the procedure has been passed down through stone tablet inscriptions over the generations. The last time it was done was four generations ago. The servants quickly scrambled, reading up on all the ancient texts of how to consult the Oracle.</p><p>An hour passed before King Sahusa was prepared. &lt; Your Majesty, your robe. &gt; The servants put on a ceremonial robe on him, one that was pure white in nature and had sharp corners on the shoulder pads, along with a weird extra flap of fabric near the breast pocket with a series of letters that he could not read. The fabric was unique, something that not even the best goblin shamans or elders could replicate in their lifetime, the threads fine and precise like an artifact from the heavens.</p><p>The procession paraded down towards a grand cave at the end of the palace, which led to a large metal door, reflective enough for King Sahusa to see his handsome face in it. &lt; Recite the heavenly numbers in order. &gt;</p><p>&lt; Yes, Your Majesty. &gt;</p><p>The goblin servants began to read off the ancient texts, following the directed pronunciation as guided. They struggled with many of the intonations, causing the words they spoke to sound like an accent of a foreign language that Sahusa had never heard of before.</p><p>As soon as they finished reading the text, a large red light above the door came to life, with a klaxon suddenly blaring out an alarming sound in different tones, scaring King Sahusa as weird metallic contraptions popped out from hidden crevices near the door, each having an ominous pipe aimed right at them.</p><p>&lt; RETREAT! &gt; He roared, prompting the servants to immediately scamper out of the grand cave and back into the valley. The retreat was hasty and disorganized, making the procession look like a foolish endeavor. While King Sahusa cursed his inability to consult the Oracle, his servants whispered to each other vigorously.</p><p>&lt; What was that?! I had never heard anything like that before?! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Perhaps the Oracle was angry at us and wanted us gone! Are we doomed? What are we going to do now? &gt;</p><p>King Sahusa felt dejected, recalling the myths of the Oracle told to him by his father. The Oracle was the reason why his tribe was even able to dominate nearly half of the goblins in the Culdao Peaks Area, making them the superior ones.</p><p><em>If the Oracle does not even want to help me, what hope do I have left?</em> King Sahusa began to ponder his options.</p><p><em>Starting a war during a famine is one way, but I must be assured of victory. A prolonged conflict would only cause more issues.</em> Sahusa returned to his room, planning while using a makeshift map of the area known by the goblins. It was a given that the area could only support so many goblins’ hunting and foraging in the forest and caves, which served as a natural barrier to the population.</p><p>However, Sahusa was not content with simply letting his people starve nor send them off to war simply to cull the number of heads to feed. He did not want to be callous, but the thought continued to remain in the back of his mind as a potentially easy way out.</p><p>Before he could think further, a warrior barged into a room, panting heavily. &lt; King Sahusa! The scouts have reported that another two tribes have fallen to Gulak! &gt;</p><p>&lt; What?! &gt; King Sahusa stood in shock. He had thought the expansion of Gulak would be slow and measured – but two tribes in a single day was a completely absurd notion to Sahusa. <em>Not even the original Sahusa managed to achieve that in the tales!</em></p><p>&lt; Have you told any of the other tribe leaders? &gt; Sahusa asked.</p><p>&lt; No, your Majesty, but the scouts might have told them directly as well! &gt;</p><p>King Sahusa’s eyes widened in shock. “Quickly assemble all my warriors for battle! We must-“ His words were caught in his throat as he could already hear the cries of his servants and the sounds of metal clashing echoing through the stone palace. &lt; We must defend our territory, now! &gt;</p><p>&lt; Y-yes sir! &gt; The warrior scampered off while Sahusa walked into a separate room, his personal armory where his father’s armor rested – a full steel armor stolen from a young human noble, complete with an arming sword. Before he could put it on, the door to the armory was blasted open, with more than fifteen goblin warriors under Osir’s command entering. They immediately tackled the king to the ground in a rush, pinning down and restraining him.</p><p>&lt; Attempting to run away while you let our entire society collapse, are we? I had high hopes for you when you assassinated your father. I thought that ‘Finally! We have a proper leader willing to do whatever it takes.’ Yet when the first news of a tribe being taken reached you, all you did was stick your head in the sand! &gt;</p><p>&lt; I was not planning to ru- &gt;</p><p>&lt; Even when the delegation by Envoy Erasg sent was massacred by the female human monster, you barely made a move, not even bothering to increase our forces or improve our equipment! The position of the king is wasted on you! &gt;</p><p>&lt; If you do this, the other four tribes will turn on you! &gt; Sahusa shot back as he was forced to kneel on the floor.</p><p>Osir let out a hearty chuckle. &lt; And you think the other four tribes are supportive of your position? FOOL! Strength is the only currency in this society! As we speak, your warriors are being cut down by the dozens! &gt;</p><p>Sahusa was about to retort before Osir delivered a kick, slamming the jaw of Sahusa with force. &lt; Useless! Drag this worthless king out to the balcony so the people can see how pitful he looks! &gt;</p><p>Sahusa struggled against his restraints as he was dragged unceremoniously through the hallway. The bodies of his servants and loyal warriors were strewn across the palace’s many corridors, the stench of blood and meat filling the air as more and more rebel goblin warriors entered the palace. The rebel warriors did not seem shocked by the turn of events, raiding and pillaging the palace and digging out all the valuable goods.</p><p>&lt; You… You have been planning this for a long time! How dare you! &gt;</p><p>&lt; An incompetent king who is oblivious to what ferments under his feet. &gt; Osir scoffed as he marched ahead of his warriors.</p><p>They soon reached the balcony, where the true scale of the devastation caused by the rebels was made obvious to King Sahusa. Tens of thousands of goblins were embroiled in fighting and fleeing, with the battle raging all across the entire length of the valley. Everything was being pillaged while the loyal warriors of Sahusa’s tribe continued to fight for their lives.</p><p>&lt; Your entire tribe shall be purged from this area! I will make sure you are the last one to die, so you can see how your bloodline falters into nothingness. Sahusa the Great is no more! &gt;</p><p>The rebel warriors strung Sahusa up onto a pole, hoisting him up high over the valley. Osir grabbed the sceptre handed to him by a warrior before activating it and amplifying his voice over the entire valley, echoing off the slopes and mountains.</p><p>[&lt; Behold! Your incompetent king who has led us into famine and hardship! As of today, he is no longer our king, for I will be yours! &gt;] Osir declared through the sceptre, shouting over the land. The rebel soldiers cheered in response as they continued to fight, while the loyal warriors’ morale began to deplete rapidly as they saw their king captured.</p><p>The common goblins were also quickly surrendering, unwilling to fight any longer to the death against a losing cause. What reason was there to defend for a king that has already been captured?</p><p>[&lt; But I will be different – as your new king, I will herald a new golden age for all goblins in this holy land! &gt;] Osir shouted a warcry, echoed by his rebel troops that were now locked in a civil war over the vast valley.</p><p>&lt; Tribe Leader, do we kill the king now? I have a method I would like to - &gt; A warrior asked, earning a slap to the face.</p><p>&lt; Idiot! He still holds value to us. No one here is to kill him without my command. &gt;</p><p>Osir ordered them to drag Sahusa down from the pole. Sahusa smirked as he knelt on the ground. &lt; So, what do you want from me? You have pillaged everything I have. Perhaps you want the name of Sahusa the Great as well? The riches of my palace? &gt;</p><p>&lt; Don’t play jokes with me. I have no use for your filthy gold and worthless paintings. You know what I want. I want the Oracle. &gt;</p><p><strong>
