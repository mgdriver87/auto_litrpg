<p>Chapter  29: Hijacking</p><p>The return of Kyle to the Seven Snakes was hushed and kept on the down low, with no fanfare. Kyle did not want to tip off any of the observers, be it the enforcers or other gangs like the Ardent Cretins. </p><p>He had left Sasha and the company workers behind in the goblin den to serve as the logistics and defenders, while the five remaining loyal companies continued to work as planned. Some of the workers definitely skimmed some of the Euria Seeds, but Kyle did not care as long as they did not eat too much into their profits. Kyle wasn’t leaving the Culdao Peaks entirely, planning to rotate his time between the two locations by using the company’s transport network to sneak himself in and out.</p><p>Kyle had returned three days after the reopening of the Seductive Serpent, and it was indeed a roaring success. Both old and new customers poured in like a never-ending tide, making the pub busy even during the day. In terms of financials, it was doing much better than the Lusty Arcian just due to its scale and business model. </p><p>The pub had been remodeled to a swanky new renovation layout, with a small, quaint restaurant serving as the front, while behind the kitchen was the main area filled with private rooms as well as multiple secondary sections that featured different types of music. It also had various stages for musicians to perform on, providing yet another avenue for aspiring players to make their name well-known. This was yet another small facet of Kyle’s plan to integrate the Seven Snakes into the local ecosystem, ensuring their influence over multiple industries. </p><p>Kyle noted a few of the customers were smoking Euria Seeds as well. The combination of the relaxing smoke and the chill atmosphere ensured that they stayed there nearly the entire day, only leaving to buy more Euria Seeds or matchsticks. <em>It is good that we have acquired a source of cheap Euria Seeds—this place could be half-turned into a full smoking den.</em></p><p>He met with Eric Dicar, who was now running the pub full-time while the inhouse brewery was just right behind. A wide, beaming smile could be seen plastered on his face. “This is far better than I dreamed of. I always wanted to run my own pub with my own creations.” </p><p><em>Hook, line, and sinker. Which alcoholic would refuse the offer to run a pub, and for free at that? </em>Kyle talked at length with Eric about his objectives for the pubs before leaving for the Seven Snakes’ base again. </p><p>“Sir, here’s the updated member list, along with the new recruits gathered in the time you were missing,” Damian presented. “Keith and I have decided on the list of vipers now. While Monica and Adrian are fairly new compared to other members, their skills in their respective roles cannot be understated. As far as we can tell, they have no misgivings toward the Seven Snakes apart from their initial capture and the underlying threat of blackmail.”</p><p>Kyle glanced through the list, focused on the vipers who acted as squad leaders. “Monica, Adrian, Niko…” He recalled Niko being one of the young men that he had seen at the Lusty Arcian while fighting off Lionel. The Seven Snakes had more than fifty associates now, but Kyle had not met all of them yet. </p><p>The new vipers had climbed the ranks due to their hard working ethic and their ability to hustle, allowing the Seven Snakes to slowly spread across the district. This, combined with the effects of the soup kitchen and the weekly public clean-up events, had skyrocketed Seven Snakes’ reputation in the community. <em>All according to plan.</em></p><p>“I trust your decision and choice.” Kyle nodded his head, but deep down, he still did not trust all of them. The betrayal in his former life still ran deep in his veins, and his plans were centered around himself for now. It wasn’t an issue of competency but a deep sense of insecurity hidden within, though Kyle did not openly acknowledge it yet. </p><p>“We seem to be on track to pay off the debt in the next two months, assuming no further hiccups. I think we’ve done it.” Keith grinned. </p><p>None of the Euria Seeds were bought by the Seven Snakes gang; instead, they were routed to the other sectors to reduce their trail. Kyle complimented Keith on the complicated paper trail, ensuring no one would be able to find out. Money was collected in cold, hard cash in person rather than through bank accounts, preventing traces by the local authorities, while the money would be cleaned and layered through the various Seven Snakes businesses. </p><p>The new supply of Euria Seeds did drop the prices in the market area, allowing Kyle to make even more profits on his addictive potions, which had been selling like hotcakes in the expanded Lusty Arcian as well as the new pub.</p><p>With this, he could generate enough money to pay off the debt to the Crimson Swords, which meant his gang was in the clear for now. Kyle heaved a sigh of relief, as did Damian and Keith, knowing that one burden was finally off their shoulders. </p><p>“We also have the casino nearly ready to go. A few more days, and it will be up and running,” Keith explained. “The extra time was due to there being no existing locations that had casinos—the enforcers had shut down most of them, and with the current level of heat we’re facing, we’re going to need to put in extra effort to hide it as much as possible.”</p><p>Kyle nodded in understanding. Running a gang was an eternal battle against the law and other gangs. Every expanding gang would have to contend with the local enforcers, who usually turned a blind eye until something grew too big. Right now, they were nearing that threshold. Damian had gotten a few corrupt enforcers on the gang’s payroll, reducing the heat, but there seemed to be trouble looming on the horizon. </p><p>It was due to a piece of news that shocked Kyle when he returned— the raids by the enforcers on the Ardent Cretins. It was reported to be extremely brutal, with many low-level grunts killed by what seemed to be an overzealous inquisitor. </p><p>“Isn’t it a good thing that they got raided? That reduces their financial advantage over us, allowing us to expand outward even more. Right now, we’re stuck in this district because of them. If the enforcers keep this up, we might have a chance to claw away some of the less defended areas.” Damian reasoned. </p><p>“No. It hints that the new inquisitors who recently took office are finding evidence and warrants or going all out. They are targeting the big fish for now as they generate the most heat, but soon, the increased surveillance will trickle down to us.” Kyle knew the Ardent Cretins must have had local enforcers on their payroll, so for them to get raided meant that there had been a sweeping change in law enforcement, or at least the purpose of law enforcement.</p><p>“Indeed, they are clearing the low-hanging fruit first of the big gangs, trying to weaken them. Did you see the West Sector? It’s almost in full-blown conflict now—a three-way fight between the Veiled Angels, Violet Demons, and the enforcers.” Keith handed a newspaper over to Kyle. </p><p>Kyle read the article, frowning slightly. <em>The Ardent Cretins limiting us now is the least of our worries—the inquisitors seem to be on a warpath for some reason. </em></p><p>“When was the last time inquisitors came to the city?”</p><p>“Erm… I don’t think it was when any of us were around…” Damian shook his head. He had only been in the gang for five years and had never heard of inquisitors coming. However, it was obvious that the Seven Snakes could come under greater scrutiny from now on. Every step had to be measured.</p><p><em>One problem after another.</em> Just when Kyle thought he was in the clear, here was another obstacle. </p><p>“We will now come up with contingency plans to deflect as much heat from the enforcers as possible. We might be on track to pay off the debt, but the enforcers can restrict our operations, which would hurt us financially.” Kyle began to pace the room, thinking hard and recalling all the methods he used to evade the Galactic Council in the past.</p><p>“It’s not enough to entice the corrupt enforcers. We need to blackmail them. Set them up with sex workers from the brothel if possible, or have them gamble at the new casino. Use our connections with the locals. Bribe them to do it if they must.” Kyle’s tone was urgent, and he spoke quickly.</p><p>“Damian, increase the number of informants we have in the local enforcers through this method.”</p><p>“Keith, we will need to begin shifting the Seven Snakes base as well into a more decentralized version. And the fronts that we currently have in place for the pub and casino should be replicated for the brothel too.”</p><p>“Already on it, sir.” Keith nodded. “I already have the Lusty Arcian remodeled to be a beauty school at the front. As for the Seven Snakes’ base, we’re in the process of acquiring a total of seven different locations that our members can rotate through. The brewery will be shifted as well, along with Professor Dicar.”</p><p>“How soon can we get the relocation done?”</p><p>“About a week. Not a lot of setups are needed, just the part on acquiring a lot of safehouses.”</p><p>“Good, I want us cleared out of here by then before we get hit. Get Monica, Niko, and Adrian in. I want the vipers to report what they’ve been doing in the past few weeks since I left.”</p><p>The three of them soon entered, lining up in front of Kyle. Kyle did not trust them fully yet, but seeing that they had been promoted out of the recruits meant that Damian and Keith did. </p><p>“Monica, you’re in charge of smuggling the alcohol brewed by Professor Dicar to our ventures. Any updates?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. The enforcers have been doing more regular wagon checks, trying to catch anyone flouting the prohibition bans. We’ve been disguising the wagons as food supplies or potions, but we did have a few wagons caught over the last two months.”</p><p>This wasn’t good. Alcohol was the lifeblood of the brothels, pubs, and casinos. “Damian, fix this issue. Make sure the patrolling enforcers don’t bother us any longer. Next, Adrian.”</p><p>Adrian was in charge of observing the district, trying to pick out other gangs’ spies or newly formed thug rackets. He used to be one of them, so he had experience spotting the same signs. “Yes, sir. My squad has rooted out five thug outfits so far. We’ve successfully converted three of them into our own affiliate rackets in exchange for protection from other thug gangs. Two thug gangs were imprisoned and are currently used by Eric in alcohol testing.”</p><p>Kyle nodded, unfazed. Alcohol brewing wasn’t exactly lethal, but a bad batch would be insufferable as well. It's better to try it on a few humans before serving it to their loyal customers. His eyes landed on Niko.</p><p>“Yes, sir! Security at our ventures has been stable. So far, no incursions or raids by enforcers.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“Yes, sir…” Niko was obviously flustered by his lack of activity compared to the other two. The lackluster reaction from Kyle pained him. <em>I need to do something big if I want Kyle to recognize me.</em></p><p>“Good. Keep it that way. Enforcer activity is increasing, so please keep your men under control. Do not do anything to give us away to the enforcers,” Kyle lectured before dismissing all of them from his office.</p><p><em>Law enforcement never changes, no matter which universe, huh?</em> Kyle smiled to himself. While there was definitely a threat from the enforcers now rising, Kyle had dealt with this for his entire former life. <em>As long as I play my cards right, we can make something out of this. </em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The restaurant was packed to the brim. Weary factory managers just clocking off the shift, stall owners who just had a good run at the food market, or administrative clerks complaining about their day. A hundred tables and booths were filled up, with two dozen waiters going back and forth. </p><p>An old factory worker entered the restaurant, his attire shabby and grimy, stained with the grease from working the machines. He rubbed his hands anxiously, walking up to a waiter. </p><p>“Excuse me, sir. Do you need something?” The waiter was confused, wondering why the older factory worker was standing in front of him.</p><p>“Hi, I’m looking for a toilet. Really urgent. Preferably one with a golden snake.”</p><p>“Ah, just right down the double doors, turn left and you’ll find it.” The waiter nonchalantly motioned behind him.</p><p>The old factory worker weaseled his way through the tables, trying to ignore the weird stares he was getting from the restaurant customers. He reached the double doors, opening to reveal a crowded kitchen with the smell of oil and spices filling the air. </p><p>He walked through them with trepidation, stealing a quick glance at the chefs. None of them seemed to be particularly bothered that he was there, despite not being a chef or a staff member. Navigating through the tight space, he soon reached a discreet black door, knocking on it with a specific pattern. </p><p>A small sliding notch slid open, revealing a pair of piercing eyes. “Who?” A gruff voice wafted from behind the door. </p><p>“I know Niko! Let me in!” the older factory worker said desperately. </p><p>The sliding notch closed, and the door opened. “One wrong move and you’re dead, old man.” The guard grinned, motioning for him to enter. </p><p>The sight beyond the door was a completely different view from the rest of the posh restaurant. Card games, dice games—every gambling game you could think of was right here. High-rollers surrounded by escorts laughed their heads on as they watched their opponents squirm on their velvet chairs. Bartenders served alcohol non-stop, with some of the customers already clearly drunk but still paying right out of their weekly pay. </p><p>The old factory worker tried his best to avoid the others, finding his way through the casino. Unfortunately, he bumped into a large Seven Snakes associate, who glared at him in anger. “Old man, you lost? Or a snitch? Whatchu doing here? Who let you in?!”</p><p>“I—I—”</p><p>“He’s with me. Back off, Bosso.” A young man wrapped in bling and a formal suit shoved the large guard away, who immediately lost his anger and scurried away, as though afraid of the young man.</p><p>“Niko!” The old factory worker patted him on the shoulders before examining him. He was the one who had introduced Niko to the Lusty Arcian in the first place. “You’re all grown up now! Look at you!”</p><p>“Haha, thanks Karl. How’s the factory been treating you?” Niko motioned to an empty booth on the side, already pre-arranged with drinks and snacks. </p><p>“Oh, you know, same old, same old. Manager got a bit pissy as usual…” Karl sat down in the booth gingerly, feeling the velvet. This level of comfort was far beyond anything he was used to, having grown up poor. He glanced at Niko, who seemed to be comfortable in this area. </p><p>“HAHA! They always get pissy, even if you do everything right. Anyway, the drinks are for you; have a go. We got our own in-house thing going now, so our alcohol is top of the line now, or at least that’s what I think.” Niko poured a glass of wine, handing it to Karl. </p><p>“I don’t have any money left. I spent it all on the potions from the brothel… I just can’t kick the habit, you know? I tried borrowing money from the bankers and moneylenders, but they are all complaining about my low income…” Karl’s face was downtrodden as he swirled the glass of wine, wondering if he needed to pay for it. </p><p>“Karl.” Niko suddenly grabbed the old man’s shoulder, staring at him. “This? All of this? Free. On the house. For old times’ sake.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Of course! We’re friends!” Niko grabbed his own glass of wine. “Cheers!”</p><p>They drank happily, talking about their past time in the factory together and reminiscing over shared memories. </p><p>“So… why the sudden visit?” Niko finally got to the point. “Don’t say for old times’ sake.”</p><p>Karl’s happy expression was frozen in place as he slowly put down the glass. “I need some extra cash, and seeing as the banks aren’t helping, I was hoping…”</p><p>“To borrow from me? Sure, Karl, but I need more assurance that you’re going to pay me back. I know exactly how much the factory pays you and how much you spend on the brothel.”</p><p>“Look, I swear I’ll pay you back. I’ll cut down on my brothel visits, and even if I don’t pay back, you can take my assets or—”</p><p>“Don’t fuck with me, Karl. I’m not the same naïve boy. You don’t have any assets left; you already pawned all of it off,” Niko snarled before suddenly slamming his glass on the table with force, frightening Karl with the sudden swap in attitude. “Be real. If you want money, you’d better come up with something valuable.”</p><p>Karl gulped internally as he saw how far Niko had changed, thoroughly intimidated. “I really don’t have anything left. I’m at my wit’s end here!”</p><p>“Are you sure? I’m confident a senior factory worker must have access to some information…” Niko grinned. </p><p>Karl’s face was slightly confused for a moment until realization dawned on his face. “You… Nononono. There’s no way. I… I’ll be fired if I help you!”</p><p>“You want the money? Or nah? You’ll even get a cut on top of that. Imagine spending every single day working on the floor, watching all those goods roll past right under your nose, knowing that you’ll never earn more than half a rakel for any of them.”</p><p>The words cut deep into Karl’s heart, but his morals still lingered. “You don’t know what you’re suggesting—the manager would call the guards and the enforcers at a moment’s notice!” Karl shook his head vigorously.</p><p>“Oh, I know <em>exactly</em> what I’m suggesting.” Just at this moment, the door to the casino opened to reveal two local enforcers still in uniform. Their piercing eyes scanned the room, eventually locking eyes with Niko. They made a beeline for the young man, but to the surprise of Karl, none of the other guards or customers even bothered, simply continuing on. </p><p>Niko stood up and shook hands with both of them, though one of them had a clearly sour expression. “You’d better have a good reason for bringing us in here.” The two enforcers sat down next to Karl, frightening him. </p><p>Niko sat down and leaned back on the booth, a wide smirk on his face. “How about a nice big cut of a factory hijacking?”</p><p>
