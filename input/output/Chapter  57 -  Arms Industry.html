<p>Chapter  57: Arms Industry</p><p>Despite the sanctions against the Seven Snakes’ shopping arcade, it had been holding up well for more than a month since its inception. Already, it had become a mainstay for local residents, both from within the district and beyond, to visit. </p><p>The light-thrower shows brought countless visitors from other sectors to watch the movies, while the free bathhouse accommodated the poorer people, improving their livelihood. </p><p>With the growing business of the shopping arcade, more and more employment opportunities began to open up as businesses and shop owners began to snap up the neighboring units, trying to entice customers who flocked to the shopping arcade. </p><p>Squatters even began to shift residences nearby, with Golden Snake Construction beginning to renovate nearby buildings into mass accommodations. While the facilities were slightly lacking in that there were only mass toilets and a barebones room, it was more than enough for the perennially homeless people. </p><p>Of course, the catch was that the squatters had to be employed in a Seven Snakes–related business, legal or not. Wages were still paid via the construction company, but in reality, it was a no-show job, where the squatters would then work in pubs, casinos, or brothels. </p><p>The stronger ones were whisked away secretly to the Culdao Peaks goblin dens, assisting in the modernization of the caves into a burgeoning industrialized society. Kyle had never been the one to place all his eggs in one basket—there was always the off chance that Raktor might suffer in the future. It was always good to have a backup plan. </p><p>As the bathhouse and shopping arcade became a hotspot for gatherings, it was easier to influence the local population into believing that the gang was a force for good. Many began to idolize the gang lifestyle, once again increasing the number of associates to nearly double what they had before. Now, the number of members neared two hundred of them, with expectations that it could swell to five hundred in another few months. </p><p>Kyle smiled to himself as he read a few newspapers reporting on the recent string of events that led to the Ardent Cretins canceling their light-thrower debut show. Many other impatient companies who had bought from the black market information dealer without checking also suffered heavily, having to scale back their expansion plans. </p><p>These reported events led to an increase in the reputation of the light-thrower theater in the Seven Snakes’ shopping arcade, making it the go-to destination for high-quality movies. More importantly, the movies being shown were much better than the amateur movies that other sectors were showing. </p><p>Short story arcs lifted right from the Galactic Era were modified for the local audience, such as the blockbuster hit <em>The Ring of the Lords</em>. However, Kyle had to heavily modify the story in the event that another person with knowledge of the franchise would pick up on it. He garbled the storyline, but the audience still lapped it up, with already a few well-known citizens being avid theater-goers. </p><p>Also, the companies that tried to barge in on the rental market for light-throwers and light-capturers were stunted by the “bad” engravings Kyle had designed and leaked on purpose, further boosting the brand name of the Silver Snakes as one of quality and assurance.</p><p>“Everyone, I am proud to announce that, as of today, we have finally turned a profit on the shopping arcade!” Keith announced to the office filled with administrative clerks, who all cheered. </p><p>“So when are we getting our bonuses?” A clerk raised his hands. </p><p>“Nice try. If we can keep this up for a month, I’ll think about it.” Keith chuckled before walking up to Kyle’s desk, who seized him up. </p><p>“Keith, status report on all companies and businesses. Keep it brief.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Our pubs and brothels have increased footfall thanks to our truce with the enforcers. Everyone knows the Seven Snakes districts are well-protected, so the mental barrier that most people had is starting to crumble.”</p><p>“Moving on. The Silver Snakes Productions have reported a monthly profit, mainly due to the rental equipment. As of now, we have been making a loss on the theater tickets.”</p><p>Kyle sighed, rubbing his forehead. “We don’t have much choice here. If we priced it appropriately, only the middle and upper classes would be able to attend. Continue.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Golden Snake completed the construction of the mass apartments and dormitories a week ago. No faults or issues have been reported as of now. The cost of utilities such as arcia power lines to each room is still being calculated.”</p><p>“That’s fine; we don’t have enough arcite ore to power it… yet.”</p><p>“We had three prospective clients, one of which is Baron Cain.”</p><p>“Baron Cain?” Kyle was astonished to hear that the noble in charge of the South Sector was directly requesting the construction company’s services. “What’s the contract for?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, quoting directly from the letter sent: ‘A request for a quote regarding the construction of a metallurgy factory in Raktor that will mainly produce processed metal ingots. Specifically, high-grade steel ingots.’ It also stressed that the factory be completed swiftly, should the contract be accepted.”</p><p>Kyle raised his eyebrows even higher, surprised. “Give the letter to me. I’ll handle it.” <em>Something isn’t right. Why would that greedy baron want a metallurgy factory when most current construction projects do not rely on it? Unless…</em></p><p>Damian entered the office, walking right up to Kyle’s desk and saluting. “Sir, the black market dealer has skipped out of town. The safehouses seemed to have been burned down. I’ve heard rumors of multiple gangs and thugs after his life.”</p><p>“Of course; he sold the degraded engravings that break apart after a certain period of time. I’m sure they will find the right people to fix it, but it is still going to take time and effort.” Kyle nodded. “Did you find anything else?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. I found scribblings on an undamaged desk. It seems to be the notes of a clerk working right under the information dealer.” Damian handed over a leatherbound notebook filled with scribbles that were barely legible. </p><p>Kyle quickly read the contents. <em>Hmm, seems like he was keeping track of all the information so he could make it out on his own when he wanted to. Commendable.</em> The journal was surprisingly detailed and clear in terms of the date and timing of occurrences, stringing a pattern together. </p><p>Kyle flipped to the pages that covered the last two weeks, immediately noticing what the pattern was leading to. “Keith, what has the military been doing?”</p><p>“Hmm? I recently heard they increased their bulk orders of arcite ore. Apart from that, I don’t know. Oh! There are military exercises that are going to be held nearby, but it’s an annual event, so it’s not too surprising.”</p><p>“When is that?”</p><p>“Hmm, its planned to be half a year from now. Why? What did you find in the journal?”</p><p>Kyle didn’t reply, instead asking Keith and Damian to bring all the old newspapers collected over the past two weeks, corroborating the journal with the events reported in the newspaper. <em>Stockpiling of energy sources, the concentration of military personnel, activation of reservist forces… and now the baron wants to build a factory?</em> “Did the baron state when he wanted it done?”</p><p>“No, but he did say he needed it swiftly…”</p><p>Kyle now knew exactly what was happening. How could a crime lord of the Melsura Star Sector not infer from the events right in front of his eyes?</p><p>“Keith, gather everyone of importance here. Our previous plan of expansion has to be changed dramatically.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Baron Cain stepped out of his wagon, escorted by five bodyguards, as he marveled at the shopping arcade. He had not attended the opening day itself and was seeing it for the first time. <em>Impressive.</em> He could now see why all the lesser nobles and landowners were so riled up by this new trend. </p><p>“Ah, Baron Cain. Pleased to be of service! I am Guang Hwa, President of the Golden Snake Constru—”</p><p>“Shut up and bring me to someone who actually matters.”</p><p>Guang Hwa was noticeably irritated by the condescending look, but he still put on a fake smile and led the baron to a specialized, well-decorated VIP room for meetings, with enough posh and luxury to make the baron feel as though he were in another noble’s dwelling. </p><p>Kyle was already waiting for him, getting up from his velvet chair and bowing. “Thank you for coming, Baron Cain. The Golden Snake Construction company is honored to have you as a potential customer.”</p><p>“Hmph. As you should.” Cain sat down opposite him in a regal chair. “Let’s get to the point. I want a quote on how much the steel factory would cost.”</p><p>“Of course. I can easily provide the numbers, but I believe we can offer something of additional benefit that may interest you.”</p><p>“What benefits can you give? A steel factory is a steel factory.”</p><p>“I am referring to other events that should not fall on certain prying ears. Rumors of war.” Kyle glanced at the five bodyguards surrounding them and Guang Hwa. </p><p>“Leave us.” Baron Cain motioned to his bodyguards, with the five and Guang Hwa complying. As soon as they left the room, Cain’s face turned extremely sour. “How the hell do you know? Espionage against nobility can be considered a crime.”</p><p>Kyle whipped out the journal he had. “Taken from a black market dealer’s clerk. Make of that what you will. I only inferred the gist of things; I am not clear on the details.”</p><p>“So what? You’re just a gang—I doubt you have anyt—” Baron Cain caught himself before continuing, his eyes narrowing as he realized what Kyle was hinting at. “You’re insane.”</p><p>Kyle smiled. “How about you hear me out before you dismiss it? If you have heard everything I had to say and still want the base quote, I won’t press the matter.”</p><p>Baron Cain hesitated for a moment but ultimately nodded, prompting Kyle to continue. </p><p>“I can roughly gather from your countenance that your attempt to sell a new technology regarding firearms to the military has failed spectacularly.” Kyle stood up and began to slowly pace the room. </p><p><em>Only because you placed your failsafe inside.</em> “That’s a groundless assertion—you don’t know if I tried.”</p><p>“That’s true, but I also understand that the nobility has a large burden when attempting any military maneuvers. Your contribution to the military is directly tied to prestige. Anyone who shirks this obligation may and has been stripped of their titles, if any. But if your contribution remains among the top, the emperor will recognize you and award you a higher title or more concessions. That was how Count Leon made his initial rise fifteen years ago.”</p><p>“For an amnesiac, you seem to know history too well.”</p><p>“Will having a simple steel factory be enough? I’m sure other nobles out there have much better resources and opportunities to contribute. Are you satisfied with your current standing?”</p><p>“Speak directly and stop beating around the bush! What exactly are you proposing?”</p><p>“You already know what I am proposing. Give me half of the funds and the license to expand the steel factory into a weapons factory as well. I’ll cover the rest. But I must retain overall control of the factory.”</p><p>Baron Cain had already expected this. “You are asking me to certify a criminal organization to have the legal license to produce guns? After all you’ve done? Are you mad?”</p><p>“Why not? Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Also, the company created to run it will be clean. At least to the outside world. As long as you just give your word, you will shoot through the ranks, not even needing to lift a single finger.”</p><p>Cain was a greedy person, so Kyle’s speech already appealed to him directly. He could already envision the countless heaps of merits and concessions he would receive once the war was won. He was also confident that Kyle had the technology and methods to elevate his contributions. After all, the war with the Ilysian Punks had clearly shown Kyle’s capabilities. </p><p>“What’s in it for you? You won’t receive any awards or prestige from doing this.” </p><p>“Baron Cain, I’ve said this before. I am a businessman, first and foremost, who had the unfortunate luck of dealing in certain ventures of high profit. Of course, I will do everything I can to come out swinging at such an exciting time, will I not? I simply want to improve my position in society, as you do. Shall we work together?”</p><p>Baron Cain was irked by the comparison, but he internally agreed with Kyle. Both of them sought to climb the social ladder—everyone wanted to move to the next rung. Even Count Leon was no different. After all, was that not why the war was about to be started?</p><p>Originally, the baron felt that the war would be a burden on him. However, with the possibility of a new venture with Kyle, he was starting to see the war as a boon instead. “Let me consider it and get back to you.”</p><p>“I understand. However, please understand we may not be able to meet the deadline the longer it is delayed. Our entire construction company will work on it.” Kyle bowed as Baron Cain stood up.</p><p>“Not a word of this is to spread to anyone else. Do you understand? Especially of the war.”</p><p>“Yes, Baron Cain.” </p><p>As Cain left the premises with his five bodyguards, Kyle could not help smiling to himself back in his office. “Keith, did you find any more information on when the diplomatic mission from Versia is coming in?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, but only fragments. They are arriving in Raktor to negotiate compensation with Count Leon in approximately a week or so. The exact day of arrival is hard to pinpoint.”</p><p>“Does not matter. Keep an eye out for their arrival.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, but why are you looking for the Versia diplomats? Are you afraid that they might take revenge for what we did to the Ilysian Punks?”</p><p>“No, Keith. I have a business proposal for them. One that will definitely pique their interest.”</p><p>
