<p>Chapter  8: Lesson Delivered</h1></p><p>With a confident strut, the brothel manager stepped further into the alleyway, but his grin soon turned into confusion when he saw just a single person—Kyle.</p><p><em>What the… Where’s the rest of the Seven Snakes?</em></p><p>Before he could voice his question, Kyle pummeled a Red Lions thug to the ground. One by one, the members were thrown about as Kyle mowed through them. The brawl was nothing short of a theatrical performance, with groans and the cracking of bodies being broken acting as the soundtrack. If left Slavin with the urge to give a standing ovation to such a picturesque demonstration of prowess and perfection.</p><p>“Who the fuck is that? What are you numbskulls doing? Get him!” Lionel yelled, prompting the Red Lions on his side to charge forward to attack Kyle. However, one of them remained behind, clearly shaken by the brutal display.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?!” Lionel glared at him with a ferocious stare, but even his intimidation couldn’t stop the member from trembling.</p><p>“L-L-Lionel, that’s the guy! That’s the guy!”</p><p>“The guy? What guy? Speak clearly before I smack you!”</p><p>“H-H-He was the one Riker killed before he went missing! It’s a ghost!”</p><p>“What?!” Lionel took another look at the guy who was now somehow fending off three at a time in the narrow alleyway, using not only his arms to parry and fend off incoming strikes but his legs as well, his entire body turned into a weapon as he delivered </p><p>strong kicks that cracked shins and jaws with precision. Already three members were out for the count, one of whom had his limb horribly twisted and bent out of shape by Kyle’s grappling and joint locks.</p><p>Before the others could reinforce the rest, Slavin reached out and grabbed a Red Lions member’s head, smashing it against the nearby wall with a loud, resounding <em>crack</em>. “Can’t just stand around when the boss is in action.”</p><p>The members of the Red Lions jostled about as the backline tried to urge the front forward, but the frontliners were reluctant to face Kyle and Slavin on separate sides.</p><p>“Screw all of you; I’ll show you how it’s done!” Lionel shouted as he shoved the members aside, coming to the front and charging at Slavin first. The neon-red hammer swung wildly at the brothel owner, forcing him to dodge or block with his arms.</p><p>His right forearm took the brunt of a downward strike, but somehow, Slavin withstood the pain, which allowed him to throw an uppercut at Lionel’s chin.</p><p>Lionel backed off instinctively, dodging the incoming fist and swapping the hammer to his left hand. With a sideward swing, he nailed Slavin in the ribs, causing the man to gag and stumble backward.</p><p>Slavin winced as he resumed his fighting stance, but a sharp pain suddenly sprouted from where he’d been hit first on his right forearm, burning through his nerves. It was as if there was lava flowing in his veins at a timed interval. Before he could recover, another pain erupted from his ribs. <em>What?</em></p><p>With a smirk, Lionel exploited the weakness, knowing his hammer’s arctech engraving effect had kicked in. Three more hits landed on Slavin, with the final one crippling his knee, forcing him to the ground. “That’s right! Stay down like the little dog you are. AND YOU. YOU’RE NEX—”</p><p>Lionel was about to taunt the other attacker, but he soon noticed all six of his guys who were fighting Kyle had already been taken out. The last was dangling by the neck, Kyle nearly crushing it before throwing him to the side. The mysterious Seven Snakes fighter had not killed any of them, keeping them barely alive instead.</p><p>Lionel instinctively gulped. Even <em>he </em>didn’t have the confidence or ability to fight off six of his own members at the same time. And the enemy looked like he did it with just an enchanted metal pipe.</p><p>“It’s just one fucker!” Lionel laughed, the fake bravado masking the fear in his heart. “He’s acting strong; he must already be tired or injured by now. GET HIM!”</p><p>The remaining five members hesitated momentarily, but then they noticed Kyle was showing slight signs of exhaustion. “RED LIONS!” one of the members yelled, spurring the rest to charge in tandem.</p><p><em>Good. Now I can stay at the back and make a retreat if necessary</em>. Lionel smirked, moving slightly toward the back.</p><p>As the members rushed forward, Kyle stretched his limbs and massaged his sore shoulders. “A good warm-up. It’s been a while since I went to town.”</p><p>The first attacker approached, and Kyle threw his enchanted metal pipe into the air instead of preparing to parry.</p><p>“What…?” The attacker glanced upward, distracted by the soaring metal pipe, before a palm strike from Kyle caved in his lower jaw. The world spun as Kyle wrestled him, tossing him onto the ground.</p><p>Two more attackers rushed him from both sides, with Kyle dodging the first hit with a sidestep and grabbing the wrist of the second attacker, tugging him with a skillful spin. In a blink, Kyle spun around and used his body weight to slam them into each other, sending the men toppling to the ground. Kyle followed up by stomping hard on his groin, and the man let out an otherworldly sound.</p><p>One last brave attacker charged Kyle, but the pipe had finally fallen, smacking him right in the back of his head. Disoriented, he was no match for Kyle’s swift kicks and punches, forcing him to drop to one knee. The Seven Snakes gang leader delivered a spinning kick, concussing him.</p><p>“Fucking hell. He’s not wearing any enchanted gear either!” Lionel was panicking now, preparing to retreat. He began to walk to the other exit, only to find Damian and the rest of the Seven Snakes waiting for him patiently.</p><p>“The lesson ain’t over yet, Lionel.” Damian grinned widely.</p><p>On the roof of the flanking building, a lone civilian intently watched the battle, jotting down notes and observing through the pulsating pipes. His eyes focused only on Kyle as the man subjugated the rest of the Red Lions, writing down the observed strength and reaction of the Seven Snakes members.<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>“Didn’t know you were that strong.” Slavin flinched as Damian treated his wounds.</p><p><em>This is nothing compared to what I was previously capable of, </em>Kyle thought. “I’m far from strong. It’s not about strength; it’s about knowing how to use your body,” he replied nonchalantly.</p><p>Slavin obviously didn’t believe him after witnessing what he was capable of, but Kyle sincerely believed what he said. The two watched the Seven Snakes members tie up the Red Lions. They were now slumped against the side, Lionel’s face barely recognizable.</p><p>Kyle had explicitly ordered the Seven Snakes to keep all of them alive. Kyle held Lionel’s armor piece and hammer in his hands.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Breastplate of Nullification (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>I should learn how these types of equipment are made</em>. Kyle made a mental note to ask Damian later. They seemed to be the primary way the locals of this world fought at a higher level than ordinary humans in his previous life. <em>Doesn’t seem too prolific either; it might be another market to exploit</em>.</p><p>“Sir, what are we going to do with them?”</p><p>“Haul them into the holding cell and feed each of them a Euria-enhanced Stamina Potion. Give them three a day, then stop for four days.”</p><p>Damian didn’t understand why Kyle was giving away his product for free when it could be sold for twice its cost through the brothel. Nevertheless, he nodded and followed orders. “Does that apply to Riker as well?”</p><p>“No, don’t touch him. I have a special plan for him.”</p><p>An arctech wagon suddenly drove up near the brothel entrance, and four local enforcers stepped out. They saw the Red Lions members tied up and Kyle ordering the Seven Snakes associates around.</p><p>Kyle glanced over his shoulder to see an enforcer wearing a captain’s cap, approaching him.</p><p>“Seems the rumor of Ulon dying was true. Been a while since I’ve seen the Seven Snakes this coordinated,” the captain remarked as he looked at the scene with clear disinterest. Even the blood oozing and snaking toward the tip of his metal sole barely fazed him, as though gang fights were extremely common in the city.</p><p>Kyle reached into his suit pocket, retrieving a thick, pre-prepared envelope and slipping it into the enforcer’s pocket. “Just a minor scuffle between friends. That’s all,” Kyle said softly before patting the shoulder of the captain.</p><p>“Indeed, just a minor scuffle. Nothing to see here. I suppose we’ll be seeing more of this, though?” The captain didn't smile just yet, refusing to budge.</p><p>Kyle sighed, retrieved another envelope, and slid it into the enforcer’s pocket as well. “Yes, there will be more of this in the future. You shouldn’t waste your precious time tending to such minor incidents. Spend that time with your families. Life is more important, is it not?”</p><p>“Indeed, it is. You have a good day, sir.” The enforcer captain grinned as he adjusted his pockets and tipped his cap before leaving with his squad.</p><p>Kyle soon left along with the prisoners, leaving Niko and the rest of the customers staring in awe. “Holy shit! Did you see that? Who the hell was that? I don’t remember Seven Snakes having such a strong leader. Even the enforcers turned a blind eye.”</p><p>“Yeah, that was amazing. I think the Red Lions might seriously be in trouble at this rate.”</p><p>“That kid can’t hold a candle to Red Lion, not even the Left Paw himself! I’ve seen him in action recently; man’s a monster. If you thought this was cool, you ain’t seen nothing yet.”</p><p>Slavin cleared his throat, motioning for the customers to return to the brothel. The sex workers and other customers who had “finished” during the commotion had peeked their heads out of the windows to witness Kyle’s spectacle.</p><p>“That man is the new head of Seven Snakes,” Slavin said proudly. “You’d better expect some big changes around here. And to those of you who were planning on stealing from us, think again.”</p><p>Niko was completely amazed. The way the Seven Snakes had appeared was far too cool, as well as the performance from Kyle. Could he even join a gang like that?</p><p>Back at their base, Kyle grimaced in his room as he removed his shirt. As intimidating as he looked, he couldn’t avoid a few hits, and bruises were now forming in those areas.</p><p>The Necklace of Healing provided some much-needed relief, slowly but surely restoring his HP back to full, with a ten-second cooldown. A quick swig of a Stamina Potion also relaxed his muscles. <em>Might be time to make some healing potions. I’ll have to discover the recipe again in a similar fashion. Shouldn’t be too hard.</em></p><p>Before the night ended, he called all of the associates into the common area. “Great work out there. However, this is only the first of many skirmishes,” Kyle warned. “Starting tomorrow, we’ll be focusing on combat training on top of the existing physical training program. I will be teaching all of you directly.”</p><p>Murmurs spread through the associates. The brave gang member who had been knocked unconscious smiled with expectation, hoping to prove himself against Kyle.</p><p>“Shit, he’s teaching us directly? Since when do gang leaders do that?” another associate whispered to his friend.</p><p>“Fuck yeah! I want to be as strong as him. Maybe one day I’ll duel him and win.”</p><p>Kyle overheard that, grinning. “You can try. But before you continue dreaming, I’ll provide a demonstration to mentally prepare you.”</p><p>Kyle led the confused associates to a spare room, where a single Red Lions prisoner was tied up on a chair. He grabbed a nearby Euria-enhanced potion, forcing the liquid down the prisoner’s throat. He then used the Necklace of Healing on him slowly, healing the prisoner to full health over a minute.</p><p>“Wha… What’s going on?” The Red Lions prisoner was stunned. Was his captor saving him?</p><p>Kyle cut the ropes, allowing the man to move about. He turned to face the Seven Snakes’ associates. “Since I took over, I noticed a clear lack of brutality in the way we fight, especially last night. Too hesitant. Too slow.”</p><p>Before the prisoner could react, Kyle spun around and delivered a forceful elbow strike into his nose, causing blood to spurt out and him to collapse on the ground, writhing in pain. The associates were shocked at the sudden outburst of violence but were soon reminded of how Kyle had gotten into his position in the first place.</p><p>“Demonstration over. Tomorrow morning, each of you will take turns beating him up.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>In another district of the South Sector, a notebook was being read by a well-dressed gentleman as he paced slowly through a large dining hall filled with people enjoying a grand feast. The candlelight and extravagant furniture were only contrasted with the lack of manners each of the diners had, eating like hooligans at a campfire. Food and liquids were tossed about.</p><p>“The Ilysian Punks and the Red Lions seem to be neck to neck, while the Wretches are still treating their wounds from the last three-way war…” the man muttered to himself as he trawled through the observer’s logs.</p><p>“SEBASTIAN!” a voice bellowed from the far end of the long dining table. Everyone stopped to listen. “Why are you still working?! The Ardent Cretins don’t pay for overtime, you know?” A chorus of laughter erupted from the rest of the diners as a large man stood up and walked forwards.</p><p>Sebastian bowed respectfully, holding the book to his chest. “Sir, as the dominator of the South Sector, it is essential to observe and keep track of every movement within that can potentially threaten our reign.”</p><p>“Yes, but currently, none of the other gangs in the South Sector can match our sheer strength. Ten districts now, with even more to come! Even if we lose every member, there’s still me. I alone rule the whole damn place! ISN’T THAT RIGHT, BOYS?!”</p><p>“YES, SIR! ARES IS THE STRONGEST IN THE SOUTH!” the Ardent Cretins chanted in response, having practiced it often.</p><p>“Damn right I am.” Ares nodded with satisfaction. “Now, work is important, but I order you to eat with us!”</p><p>Sebastian begrudgingly dragged his feet to an open seat, plopping down on the bench while the others feasted on the scrumptious food before them.</p><p>However, the notebook was still open on his lap, with Sebastian glancing at it occasionally. A log near the end caught his eye.</p><p><em>Seven Snakes has a new leader, and he beat up a dozen Red Lions alone, with no arctech equipment. Further observations will be needed. Perhaps a talk is necessary to soothe ambitions.</em></p><p>“This will be a problem.”<h1><a id="_z6z23pnzsdkz"></a>
