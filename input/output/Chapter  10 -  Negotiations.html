<p>Chapter  10: Negotiations</h1></p><p>“To negotiate, of course.” Kyle spoke clearly, causing Haui to raise his eyebrows.</p><p>“I don’t think one needs seven gang members to perform a rudimentary negotiation.”</p><p>“Negotiations require an even playing field.” Kyle nodded his head at the guards.</p><p>A smirk appeared on Haui’s face, his expression confident. “I doubt your members are as prepared as my private guards. Are you sure these are the only guards I have prepared?”</p><p>“Then you would just have to account for me as well.”</p><p>The two stared at each other for a brief moment before Haui finally broke into laughter. “Very good. Come in.”</p><p>The two of them entered the store, with the gang members and the guards staring each other down outside.</p><p>“I must say, I did not expect you to be the leader of the Seven Snakes gang. I merely thought Damian was paid a few rakels to escort a foreign individual of note around, seeing as how he had to explain everything to you.” Haui sat behind the counter, arranging his robes.</p><p>“I did not expect you to have paid for observers around the district.” Kyle paced around the store slowly, looking at some of the potions he had not examined the last time he came.</p><p>“The Seven Snakes can’t be the only ones patrolling around, can they? My business depends on who runs the district. But let’s cut the crap.” Haui’s demeanor suddenly changed, his eyes glaring with ferocity. “You’ve been undercutting my potions through the brothel and are now flooding the market with knockoffs via the Red Lions. Even if Wrent is from another district, the fluctuations in market price would directly affect me and upset the established rule of the Alchemists’ Guild.”</p><p>Haui stood up and paced around, picking up a chisel and twirling it in his hands. “There were a myriad of ways I could have gone about this. The moment I heard about the brothel providing half-priced stamina potions through a… ‘loyalty’ program, I contemplated an assassination or a kidnapping.”</p><p>“But you didn’t.”</p><p>“Indeed. I understand that for you to reverse-engineer my potions that fast, you must have an extremely impressive ability to decipher the closely guarded recipes of the Alchemists’ Guild without external help. Maybe even a device that can do it for you,” Haui replied. “And the mass-production scale is on the level of factories, something the Alchemists’ Guild is clamping down hard on to maintain the high price margins. As such, you are extremely valuable as long as you are able to evade detection. If I sent anyone to kill you, it would be a loss for me. I don’t believe any organization I hire would be willing to kill you if they found out the true reason behind the contract.” Haui sighed.</p><p>“And I can’t kill you myself because you are extremely well protected. I doubt this is the full extent of your security forces as well. I would not want to anger the Alchemists’ Guild either,” Kyle replied. This was why he didn’t just run over and kill Haui—it was far too costly, and he didn’t know the full extent of Haui’s backing.</p><p>Haui was a bit surprised before a broad smile appeared on his face. “It appears that we are quite alike, you and me. Neither party can truly eliminate the other. Even if we try to, the consequences would be far too brutal. So here we are.”</p><p>“What’s your proposal?”</p><p>“From my observations, you can’t create new potion recipes, as you don’t have formal alchemist training or connections. However, your competence with reverse-engineering and mass production gives me great insight into how to target a wider audience and potentially profit off the common people, not just the upper middle class or leaders of gangs. How about this—for every potion you reverse-engineer from me, you must give me half of the profits indefinitely.”</p><p>Kyle’s eyebrow twitched slightly. Asking for half was daylight robbery. “A tenth. And you must tell me the recipes.”</p><p>Both of them smirked, knowing they had entered the negotiation phase. </p><p>“The recipes are strictly off-limits. I am bound by code through the Alchemists’ Guild never to reveal such information to non-members. It spoils the market for other alchemists, you see. Even mass production is a no-go. However, the reason I ask for half is that I am willing to shelter you from the guild as well, by claiming you are my ‘associate.’ The recipes will still be off-limits, but you will not suffer repercussions. In exchange, the mass-produced potions must be of a lower quality to truly evade a deep investigation from the guild.”</p><p><em>Quality? Is he referring to the “Basic” tag on the potions? </em>Even if he rejected Haui now and went to another alchemist’s shop to purchase potions,  the Alchemists’ Guild would eventually catch onto him as well, seeing how good Haui’s informant network was.</p><p>“Fine. Two-tenths, but only for a year after for each potion type.” </p><p>“Ridiculous. Four-tenths, for three years,” Haui countered.</p><p>“Two-tenths, two years.”</p><p>“Three-tenths, four years.”</p><p>“Two-tenths, two years.” Kyle was not budging anymore. </p><p>“Fine. Deal.” Haui drafted a simple contract on parchment, passing it to Kyle to sign. A non-aggression clause was in there as well, to ensure neither party tried to backstab each other. They still could, but then it would be a breach of the contract.</p><p>Contracts between criminals were less of a legal requirement and more of a justification for retaliation. Kyle also didn’t want to earn a bad reputation for breaking a contract or pact he signed—Ulon had already done enough damage. Similarly, Haui also had a reputation to uphold. </p><p>There was another clause where Haui had the right to determine what potion recipes to give Kyle. “You must understand that the more exquisite potions are heavily guarded recipes of the guild. Under no circumstances can we mass-produce this without having a strong-enough power base.”</p><p>“You make it sound like we are already partners.”</p><p>“Of course. Your profit is mine as well.” Haui smiled. He had obtained Kyle as a future distribution network—a free money flow. </p><p>Kyle didn’t lose much either. In exchange for money, he had gained a direct source of essential potion recipes and protection from the Alchemists’ Guild. </p><p>“Well then, with the Red Lions now well aware of your mass production capabilities and you imprisoning their members, there’s no doubt a fight will come. May I suggest this potion? Again, I cannot provide you with the recipe.” Haui handed over two potions: the first being a glossy, indigo flask with a tinge of red swirling within the liquid.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Strength Potion (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>The second potion was a green, infused with what seemed to be Poair Leaves that were not yet dissolved.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Health Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Restores a moderate amount of health.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle nodded, taking a few potions. He didn’t need to pay Haui, as he had already provided twenty percent of the profits.</p><p>The men walked to the store entrance before Haui stopped Kyle. “A fair warning—the Ardent Cretins already have an observer watching this district. They are always watching. Do not act too overtly if you want to remain under the radar. I’d prefer it if another gang didn’t steal you away just yet. If you’re going to sell potions, do not oversupply like you did for the Red Lions. That alone might already cause the Alchemists’ Guild to start asking too many questions. Keep any subsequent contracts below a hundred for now.”</p><p>Haui and Kyle stepped outside, only to see the gang members and the private guards about ready to come to blows. They were throwing insults with wanton abandon. Haui sighed and called the private guards back.</p><p>The gang members were astonished even as the fight broke up. Today was a day of surprises, seeing how Kyle had successfully negotiated with two separate individuals.</p><p>“Hey, I thought Alv—Kyle was all about beating people up? I was almost certain I would see Haui beaten into a pulp.”</p><p>“Yeah, not sure what has gotten into him.”</p><p>Kyle ordered the gang members to return with him. As he walked, he noticed a lone local enforcer of the Sanctum eyeing him carefully. <em>The enforcers seemed to be on to me as well. </em></p><p>With so many major powers watching him, every action he took from now on had to be measured. Haui was right in that he was indeed planning to sell more potions, but he now had to limit the supply.</p><p>This also meant that prices would need to be in line with the current market. With this, Haui’s profit margin for the basic potions would still be fairly secured.</p><p><em>He sure is crafty.</em> <em>I must find a way to either get rid of him or integrate him into the gang. The Alchemists’ Guild must be extremely dangerous if every alchemist is like this.</em></p><p>Returning to the Seven Snakes’ base, Kyle began his potion discovery process, attempting to master the strength potion recipe. More ingredients were involved, so he tried everything he could think of. </p><p>With a simple distillation process, he managed to separate the liquid from the dissolved Greis Powder, though another material sludge was mixed into the residue. He grabbed the flask of residue, examining it.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Residue of Strength Potion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A mixture of Greis Powder and Olio Roots.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Inflicts extreme muscle pain on consumption.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He then picked up the condensed liquid that had been distilled.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Concentrated Yul’s Tears</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Increases metabolism rate as well as energy transfer through the human body.</p>
