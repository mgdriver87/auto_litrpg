<p>Chapter  15: Repercussions</h1></p><p><em>The next day…</em></p><p>“Did you hear? The Seven Snakes lost to the Red Lions and have to pay reparations.”</p><p>“Nah, no way. I saw them fight each other—they were at a draw! Sure, the Seven Snakes were nearly beaten shitless, but they were extremely tenacious.”</p><p>“Their new leader seems to be much more competent than Ulon, but I guess a small-time gang will always be small-time.”</p><p>Such were the types of rumors going around the food market and the South Sector, but they were drowned out in a sea of other conflicts. The Seven Snakes were not the only gang fighting at the time—it was the city of Raktor, so a fight was around every corner.</p><p>“Are we going to be the next dominator of the South Sector?” one of the more overtly excited gang members asked.</p><p>“Idiot, no way! How the hell are we going to overtake the Ardent Cretins? Wait, fuck that. We can’t even go against the main force of the Red Lions!”</p><p>“Nah, believe in Kyle! I like him much better than his Alvin persona.”</p><p>“Can’t wait to have my own underlings; I’ll put them through the same training routine!”</p><p>The mood in the base was festive, but Kyle was not. At least not until the waves had died down. He sat in his office, waiting patiently until Keith came in, his face clearly shaken. </p><p>“Sir, there’s someone here to see you.”</p><p>“Is it the enforcers? I’ve been expecting them.” Kyle had anticipated a potential visit, seeing as they had now established their foundation in the district. He was not averse to collaborating with the enforcers—crime and law went hand in hand. Already in his mind, he was coming up with ways to entice and lure the enforcers into his pocket. <em>Perhaps a tax-generating scheme or even mutual assistance in reducing crime. </em></p><p>He could even use the enforcers to potentially suppress some of the thug groups lurking around the district. Despite the Seven Snakes’ resurgence, it was foolish to assume that they had complete control over every individual in the area—countless upstarts and small three-man gangs ran multiple smuggling rings and production lines as well.</p><p>But Keith shook his head violently. “N-N-No, sir. It-It’s n-not the enforcers.” Keith barely stuttered the words out, his hands trembling and with fear. </p><p>“Is he alone?” Kyle squinted his eyes, tossing out his current thoughts.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Kyle’s expression darkened. “Have him come in. Prepare the best tea we have.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Soon, a well-dressed gentleman in a butler outfit walked in, his hair slicked back in jet-black lines, and his face immaculate. The suit spoke volumes of care and attention to detail—the thread count was specifically selected and the gradient of the fabric was astounding. He did not bow nor show any signs of respect toward Kyle, treating him like a decoration while he simply walked around the office and looked at the bookshelves and furniture. “How quaint. I am a bit sad to see Ulon’s hallmark ornaments missing.”</p><p>“They were quite a distraction, so I had them auctioned off.”</p><p>“A pity. I would have hoped he kept some of my older gifts.” The man finally locked eyes with Kyle before sitting in a chair meant for guests, relaxing as though he had just arrived home.</p><p>“I’m sure he appreciated the gifts nonetheless.”</p><p>“Oh, my gifts pale in comparison to the gift you gave him.” The man chuckled at his own joke. Keith soon entered the room with a teapot and cup on a delicate tray, placing it down and pouring a cup for the guest. However, his hands were shaking terribly, the tea violently vibrating as the glass clinked.</p><p>The man simply smiled at Keith and turned back to Kyle. “You’re doing much better than Ulon did. When I first met him, he could barely reply to me or look me in the eye. I recall him trembling continuously, unable to form a coherent sentence. Much like this poor young boy.” He motioned his hand to Keith, who quickly bowed and took a step back.</p><p>“I would not use Ulon as a measure for eloquence—or a measure for anything.”</p><p>“Indeed. Ulon was never able to make use of what he had on hand.” The man chuckled, closely examining Keith and sizing him up. “A gait of a scholar. Sharp eyes, though bravery has to be worked on a tad more. Your abilities seemed to be far wasted here. Perhaps I can offer you another form of employ—”</p><p>“Get to the point,” Kyle interjected in defiance. The man did not seem irked in the slightest, giving a mere gentle smile as he crossed his legs.</p><p>“I’m here to deliver a form of greeting from our leader, Ares UIras. He has only the best wishes for the future of the Seven Snakes and hopes to potentially forge relationships where possible. We are open to partnerships or collaborations in any future ventures.”</p><p>Kyle nodded. “You may give him my thanks, Sebastian. I will surely take him up on his offer in the near future.”</p><p>“Ah, a man who has done his research. Consider me surprised that even an amnesiac knows about me.”</p><p>“It’s hard not to know legends and myths about the vice-leader of the Ardent Cretins.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t flatter me. I’m simply doing my job. I’m sure that you will have your own myths in the future—if given enough time.”</p><p>“Only if I am allowed to.”</p><p>Sebastian’s smile grew. “I knew we would understand each other. A big improvement over Ulon, as repugnant of a standard he might be. It seems like being an amnesiac is a gift of sorts; perhaps I should try it one day.”</p><p>“I can have an alchemist prepare a memory-erasing potion if you so wish. Perhaps we could set an appointment?”</p><p>Sebastian laughed, while Kyle maintained a stoic expression. “Maybe when I’m retired. For now, I still have to manage a group of naughty children who only get rowdier as they age. Always aiming to become the parent, thinking they have what it takes to rule the world. Do you have any tips for handling them?”</p><p>“Some sweets or cake would make them easy to handle. A gift or a concession goes a long way to fostering trust.”</p><p>“Ah, but children are quick to forget, especially when another carrot is dangled in front of them. That reminds me.” He stood up, rummaging through his inner pocket.</p><p>“A token of goodwill from the Ardent Cretins.” Sebastian retrieved a transparent glass bottle holding a miniature galleon suspended by wood inside. “An exquisite gift, handcrafted by one of our patrons.”</p><p>He stood up and placed it on the table in front of Kyle. The boat was extremely intricate and fragile. Keith looked at it and could tell that even a slight, sudden jerk could cause the boat to collapse. For Sebastian to be able to carry it in his suit without breaking it was stupendous.</p><p>“Do be careful with it. It is extremely delicate. If one were to rock the boat too much, the pieces within would begin to crumble. Hopefully it will still be intact the next time we meet. ” Sebastian took his leave, with Keith escorting him out of the base.</p><p>When Keith returned, his leader was still staring at the ship.</p><p>“Wow, I didn’t know the vice leader of the Ardent Cretins was so nice! That boat looks really expensive!” Keith exclaimed. </p><p>“It was not a nice conversation, far from it. It was a threat,” Kyle responded grimly. After all that he had done to make sure he remained off the radar, the big fish of the South Sector had still locked on to him. He expected someone of note from the Ardent Cretins to visit eventually, but he never expected the vice leader to come in person. </p><p><em>Don’t rock the South Sector, lest you want your gang to crumble into pieces.</em> Kyle knew what the warning was, clear as day. He clenched his fists tightly. </p><p>With the Ardent Cretins having their eye on him now, any sort of aggressive expansion or scaling up would be heavily scrutinized. The moment Sebastian detected a threat, Kyle knew he was the type to use everything he had to eliminate it immediately. That was the privilege of the strong, after all. Kyle himself used to do that in his former life. </p><p>“Keith, call Damian in. We will have to restructure the plan moving forward.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The Central Sector of the city was the most prosperous. Buildings made of arcia-infused glass towered over streets filled with automatic carriages, guided by the roads as they ferried aristocrats, nobles, and the general upper class to and fro. </p><p>An opulent and intricately detailed building reminiscent of a temple was one of the key features of the sector. While many of the locals and tourists would admire it as a work of art, it was equally feared by many of the gang leaders. </p><p>A lone girl walked up the marble steps, clearly excited as her cobalt-blue eyes darted around. She checked her pearl-white cloak, rubbing a small stain off the shiny, silver pauldrons. The golden hems of the cloak fluttered as she continued climbing, her straight dress pants and a buttoned shirt peeking from underneath. </p><p>“Inquisitor Kitana, here under orders from the archbishop.” She bowed to the guards at the entrance, who respectfully bowed back. They performed a simple check on her belongings before allowing her in.</p><p>She entered the vast temple, the ceiling and pillars adorned with paintings that had been completed over generations. At the height of it, all in prime view, was a portrait of Yual, the Emperor of the Yual Dominion that ruled over the city of Raktor and others.</p><p>As she walked, she could hear whispers from enforcers and clerks who stared at her, their echoes bouncing off the concave ceiling and domes. </p><p>“The inquisitors are here? Finally, we get some much-needed help.”</p><p>“Yes, the bloodbath in the West Sector between the Veiled Angels and the Violet Devils is escalating far beyond our control. If the inquisitors didn’t show up, we might have had to call in the military.”</p><p>“The military would never agree to intervene in civil affairs unless ordered by either the duke or the emperor himself.”</p><p>A servant led her to a smaller audience chamber, where an old priest was kneeling in front of a statue of the emperor. There were already nine others like her standing behind rows of pews and praying. Kitana quickly took an empty spot, clasping her hands in prayer as well. </p><p>After five minutes, the priest finally stood up, turning to face them. “My fellow priests and priestesses. It is with great honor that you have come before me and the emperor today to be given a special role.</p><p>“Crime has infiltrated the streets of Raktor, defiling the empire-wide bans set forth by the archbishop himself. Alcoholism, prostitution, senseless violence, and the proliferation of weapons are just some of the infestations that choke Raktors by the gut. The citizens of this city do not know what true purity is and are unwilling to adhere to the law. While the archbishop has turned a blind eye to it in the past, he can no longer divert his eyes from the stray sheep that are running amok.</p><p>“You shall act as the eyes and ears of the Sanctum of Yual. You are the arbiter, the judge, and the executioner of our will and our beliefs. Those who claim to be citizens of the Yual Dominion but do not uphold the same values must be taught otherwise, by words or by fear of death. For it is only through fear that they may learn to love the encompassing embrace that is our emperor.”</p><p>The priest retrieved a scroll, unrolled it, and read it. “As such, under holy appointment and orders direct from the archbishop himself, you are all now appointed as inquisitors of the Yual Reign. Go forth and cleanse this city of filth and bring glory to the emperor!”</p><p>“Glory to the emperor! Glory to Yual!” The ten inquisitors bowed.</p><p>They remained bowed as a few servants brought out a series of peaked caps, with the priest bestowing each individual with one, the symbol of the inquisitors clearly visible. The inquisitors solemnly received it, with one even bearing a grim expression as though he were about to be sent to the gallows.</p><p>Contrary to the others, Kitana received the cap excitedly, a fire lighting up in her eyes as she bowed in respect. The old priest chuckled before placing his hand on Kitana’s shoulder. “Keep that enthusiasm strong and steadfast. You’ll need it to face down the evil lurking in the city.”</p><p>“Yes, Bishop.” Kitana bowed even lower.</p><p>Soon, the ceremony was over, and Kitana was already ordered to head toward another room to meet the department that she would be in charge of. Each pair of inquisitors was to oversee the assistance of a different sector so as not to clash with each other. They were not working alone—they would be reporting to the overseeing bishops of each sector and working with local enforcers. </p><p>The inquisitors talked amongst themselves as they walked. “I sure hope I get assigned to the Central Sector. If I get sent to the West, I’ll die.”</p><p>“Why did the Sanctum even assign me here? This has got to be the worst place to be stationed right after graduation!”</p><p>While the inquisitors lamented the results, they barely noticed Kitana’s absence. Instead of following them, she had headed to a secluded area, grinning as she placed the cap snuggly on her head. She then glanced around, making sure no one was near. As she hunkered down, she whispered to herself, “Statistics.”<h1><a id="_3dx14b0c683"></a>
