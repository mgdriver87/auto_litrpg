<p>Chapter  58: Double Agent</p><p>The procession was public, as the Versia diplomatic team arrived via a wagon convoy protected by more than three dozen guards. The diplomats stared in curiosity as a dozen light-capturers had their beady black lenses aimed at them. </p><p>The news of the light-capturer invention was not particularly new in Versia, where a few entrepreneurial companies had already tried to create their own knockoffs. However, it was still a sight to see it spread through society so quickly. News companies were capitalizing on the new medium of information rapidly, its changes echoing through the city of Raktor.</p><p>“Ah, Minister Dekar. It is good to finally meet you in person.” Count Leon was already in position, ready to receive them at the grand steps to the central office that handled all affairs in the county. He bowed to a man wearing a sharp, tight uniform adorned with tens of medals, signifying his rank and position in the government of Versia.</p><p>“It is good to see you as well, Count Leon.” Minister Dekar smiled as he stretched out his hand, shaking Count Leon’s hand in a sign of goodwill. Both of them had wide smiles on their faces, as did the rest of the accompanying diplomatic group and the four barons who stood behind Count Leon. </p><p>The reporters quickly recorded the entire event, speaking rapidly into their arctech recording devices, their voices to be released alongside the recorded light-capturer movies. </p><p>The dignitaries wasted no time, immediately following Count Leon into the meeting room, where two long tables were laid out facing each other, with chairs already pre-designated for each member of the diplomatic team. </p><p>The opposing parties chatted a bit with each other, exchanging small talk as they waited for the meeting to begin. Many of them knew each other from both sides, having met before in their former jobs or through diplomatic missions both before and after the previous war. </p><p>“Everyone, we shall begin.” Count Leon announced, taking his seat right in the center of the Yual Dominion’s table. </p><p>As soon as the meeting began proper, however, the air immediately became tense, with the two teams clearly knowing what this was all about. </p><p>“So, to clarify the purpose of this meeting: your citizens have been caught red-handed smuggling weapons into Versia from Raktor, and—”</p><p>“Ex-citizens, need I remind you,” Minister Dekar interrupted. “General Javel had been previously stripped of his citizenship. And so have all of the… Ilysian Punks’ members.”</p><p>“—and the Versia military has been directly complicit in this entire affair.”</p><p>“How strange. This sounds like a simple case: Your nation can’t keep its criminal organizations under control. I would also like to officially state that the Versia military has not received any of these aforementioned weapons, none whatsoever.”</p><p>“Criminals that stem from your nation are directly sabotaging Raktor to empower Versia. I have direct evidence that your military personnel, former or not, are actively assisting in the transfer of these smuggled goods.” Count Leon motioned with his hand, prompting a servant to bring forward a stack of papers, placing them in front of the diplomatic delegation. </p><p>“Each of these papers represents a formal license to transport weapons around the country of Versia, signed off directly by an official of the government.”</p><p>“We have already dealt with the corrupted official, but the fact remains that the guns have never made their way into the formal military. It is purely a criminal transaction, from one black market to another. We did not actively plan for nor support such activities—our own Versian enforcers are performing an investigation right no—”</p><p>“I don’t care about what your enforcers are doing!” Count Leon snarled, raising the tension even higher. “The simple fact as I see it is this: It is Versians who have been smuggling guns out of our military facilities INTO your country, and you must pay!”</p><p>“I find that accusation ungrounded and misleading—the government of Versia does not claim to have jurisdiction or control over every single citizen that has been excommunicated and stripped of citizenship! Such a statement would lead me to also accuse your ex-countrymen of establishing human trafficking rings in my own country as well!” Minister Dekar shot back. “On top of that, your military shows clear signs of mobilization, something that is clearly aimed at Versia!”</p><p>“Is my military not allowed to perform military exercises within our sovereign territory? We have been performing the same exercise every two years.”</p><p>The barons and the Versian delegation remained silent as the argument was solely waged between the minister and the count. Both sides were unwilling to back down, but the minister knew that he had already lost the moral ground. It was an undeniable fact that the guns had indeed been smuggled into Versia. He tried his hardest to deflect or counter with other examples, but Count Leon stayed on task. </p><p>“Here is my ultimatum: Your country will catch all criminals involved in the smuggling and distribution of Yual Dominion’s technology, as well as pay back reparations of an equivalent sum. The hijacking of our military facilities has negatively impacted our economy, resulting in losses of nearly 500 million rakels in total.”</p><p>“Ridiculous! You want us to be your hunting dogs and compensate you as well?! I would like to remind you that the original reason for the smuggling to occur was because you, too, have potential corruption brewing in your own military. How is it possible for a small gang to smuggle that many guns? Surely not without inside information?”</p><p>The negotiations went back and forth before the meeting concluded indecisively, adjourning for a lunch break. Count Leon signaled toward Minister Dekar, prompting the man to follow him into a side room, which was a simple resting area with amenities. </p><p>Closing the door behind him, Count Leon gave a smile, his countenance far different from the aggressive mannerism he portrayed in the meeting. He shook hands with Dekar again, slightly confusing the minister. </p><p>“Ah, I guess your predecessor did not inform you of what is going to happen.” Count Leon smirked as he poured himself a glass of wine, sipping on it carefully. “Did you ever wonder how your predecessor was able to buy such a grand mansion despite the paltry government salary your ‘democratic’ system pays you?”</p><p>Dekar squinted his eyes in comprehension. “You’re saying he accepted bribes. From you.”</p><p>“Minister Dekar, I’m sure you are a proud citizen of Versia who believes in the democratic system, but be honest with yourself. How hard have you been working to support the people of Versia, with nothing but a pittance of a salary to show for it? Despite being a representative of an entire nation! The business owners are all earning far more than you! I hear Harrison is making more than ever. Do you not think it is unfair?”</p><p>“I will not be so easily swaye—”</p><p>“Ah, listen to my offer first. I will give you fifty million rakels as well as show clear signs of demobilization across the country. The military exercise will be postponed as per usual. You get to go back home and claim that you are a herald of peace, solving the crisis. I will also give you custody of General Javel and every other Ilysian Punks member that is rotting in jail in due time, letting you show off to the people that you have worked hard to ensure that your people remain free. What a good story, is it not? Your political career will be legendary! Or perhaps you would prefer the alternative of war?”</p><p>The meeting soon resumed after the lunch break, with the diplomatic delegation taking their seats once again. Many of them expected the same argument to be continued between Count Leon and Minister Dekar, but surprisingly, there was little opposition raised by the minister anymore. </p><p>“Fine, we shall pay the compensation of 500 million rakels. But in return, you must cease the mobilization of Yual Dominion forces at our border! Also, you must release all Versian citizens currently in custody back to us.” Minister Dekar put on a strong façade. </p><p>“A fine compromise. Under the authority bestowed upon me by the emperor, I accept the deal on behalf of the Yual Dominion. Let us hash out the finer details of transfers now.”</p><p>The meeting took another three days as the members of the diplomatic team scrambled to hash out the clauses in the deal, covering every possible legal loophole in the agreement. The Yual Dominion tried to sneak a few terms into the agreement, which were immediately caught by the delegation, prompting a few arguments and accusations of unfair treatment.</p><p>As the procedure was going on, Minister Dekar was resting in his room when a diplomat knocked on his door. “Come in.”</p><p>“Sir, apologies for disturbing you.”</p><p>“It is of no matter. What is it? Has the count tried to sneak in a separate clause yet again?”</p><p>“No, sir, the Yual Dominion has stopped trying to do so for now. I received word that a certain individual would like to meet you, though he is only willing to meet you outside Raktor.”</p><p>“Outside Raktor? Preposterous! Sounds like a trap to simply assassinate me!”</p><p>“He says we can bring as many people as we want. Also, he sent us this. We have checked it to ensure it’s neither a bomb nor an assassination device.” The diplomat handed over a metallic case embellished with an ornamental design that seemed oriental. </p><p><em>This… This is!</em> Minister Dekar’s eyes widened in shock. Everyone had heard about the first civilian repeater handgun sold in an auction at the Central Sector of Raktor. Even his agents had reported on the design of the handgun, touted as being better than most current military guns.</p><p>Dekar opened the case to reveal a replica of the Oriental Bloom that Baron Cain owned himself, though it was not exactly the same. “He’s the creator?!”</p><p>“In the note provided with this case, he claims he is not the creator but someone who has managed to decipher the inner workings behind the handguns. He wants to discuss a potential agreement for Versia.”</p><p>Minister Dekar was more than happy to hear this. The reason why Versia was always on the back foot was due to its perceived weaker military strength and a smaller economy. After all, their gross product did not even match a third of Raktor’s economic output. He would never admit it publicly, but the government was definitely complicit in the smuggling of guns from Raktor in order to alleviate the imbalance in military strength. </p><p>Now that he had a chance to meet with an arctech designer able to level the playing field, he was not going to let up that easily. </p><p>“Where is the meeting point?”</p><p>“Around the Culdao Peaks area. I suggest we use a body double to make the Yual Dominion believe that we are returning to Versia while another wagon takes you to the secret meeting point.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The plan was put into place immediately, with Minister Dekar and a team of a dozen Versian guards disguised as a merchant escort moving out from Raktor toward the Culdao Peaks. </p><p>They blended in easily into the hordes of merchants in the now-expanded Culdao Peaks Town, with the marketplace increasing in size and the wealth of the town increasing. More and more people were migrating into the town in search of fame and fortune, while other merchants began to invest in supporting industries to facilitate the travelers and other traders who bought and sold the Euria Seeds. </p><p>A lone hooded man was waiting for them in an alleyway, immediately turning and walking into the forest while Dekar and the guards followed. <em>Where is he taking us? I’ve heard rumors of domesticated goblins, but surely he does not intend to use the hostility of the goblins against us?</em></p><p>The Versian guards were all well armored under their normal clothes, complete with an armor set as well as an arctech pistol. Dekar gingerly stepped through the dense foliage, though there was a clear, rough path created by the continuous movement of workers carrying Euria Seeds. </p><p>Suddenly, five goblins appeared on the treeline, leaping past the guards overhead, who all reacted instantly and held their pistols at the ready. </p><p>“Hold your fire—they’re making sure you weren’t followed.” The lone hooded man turned around, with fifteen goblins lining up behind him. </p><p>“Wha— How did you domesticate the goblins?” Dekar couldn’t help asking. Even in his homeland, there were many failed attempts at restraining the goblins, causing losses and continuous rebellions. </p><p>One of the goblins clearly took offense at the insult at being treated like cattle and was about to retort when the hooded man raised his hand. “You do not need to know how I did it, only if I can deliver. The playing field between both militaries is hilariously skewed, and both you and I know Versia needs a helping hand.”</p><p>“So you want us to buy weapons from your operation here in the Culdao Peaks…?”</p><p>“Of course. I would like to aid in the upgrading of the Versian military to counter Raktor aggression.”</p><p>Dekar grew slightly wary. <em>He must have an ulterior motive. </em>“Why have you not done this for the Yual Dominion? Surely they would pay you a higher price.”</p><p>“Their motivations are not aligned with mine. I am a firm believer in Versia sovereignty. The governing principles of the Yual Dominion are far too backward for my liking. Although, I am open to have a further meeting when you are ready to negotiate further.”</p><p><em>What rubbish. He is obviously in it for the money, but he is right. This is something the Versian military needs dearly.  </em>Instead of revealing his cynicism, Dekar had a wide grin on his face. </p><p>“Ahah, a fellow supporter of democracy! Of course, we welcome your help! However, this… negotiations must be held in Versia, though I would prefer that these goblins do not follow you.” </p><p>Dekar glanced again at the fifteen goblins, many of whom snarled back at him. <em>If he comes and stay in Versia, I will be able to deploy better spies than the ones we have in Raktor to steal the design. It seems that these goblins are not easy to bribe. Maybe that’s even better—I can capture him myself. I have to hook him in first.</em></p><p>“That is only possible if your government gives me the assurance that I will not be attacked or enslaved within Versia itself.” The hooded man countered. “My technology and learnings are a prize in itself - any attempts to steal them will be met with… unnecessary complications for you and your men trailing you.” </p><p>“Of course, of course, we would never hurt you” Dekar grinned widely, hiding his shock at the hooded man’s awareness of his hidden bodyguards scattered around the forest in case a fight broke out. “In fact, as a representative of the state, I myself will issue you a letter of approval for your direct entry into Versia.!”</p><p>“Then I look forward to future negotiations. Send me a messenger when you are ready.” </p><p>“Indeed. I look forward to a fruitful relationship, Mister…?”</p><p>“Greyborn. Kris Greyborn.”</p><p>
