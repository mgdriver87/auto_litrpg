<p>Chapter  42: Close Quarters</p><p>Eric Dicar winced as he plugged his ears with his finger, the screeching sound of the mortar tubes and the deafening thuds nearly blasting his eardrums apart. “I didn’t sign up to be an artillery crew!”</p><p>Gordon wiped the sweat off his brow as he and two other associates lugged a custom-made metal spherical ball and loaded it into the base of the mortar before closing the hatch. “CLEAR!” Gordon yelled and pressed the trigger.</p><p>The ten arcite fuel packs, stacked haphazardly next to the mortar, chugged furiously. They powered the acceleration engravings along the side of the tubes that were currently glowing red hot. With a bang, the metal ball was lobbed up high and far away, sailing toward a building far away.</p><p>Adrian’s voice crackled over the arctech radio. [You’re off target. You need to hit it fifty meters to the right!] </p><p>“Fuck!” Gordon cursed, motioning to Eric to prepare the next batch of explosive. It’d already been three hours since the battle had begun, with their mortar performing the first strike. </p><p>There was not enough time to mass-produce the explosives, requiring Eric to mix them on the spot. The formula was far too dangerous for others to handle—a simple rounding error in the percentages may very well cause the projectile to blow up in the associates’ hands. </p><p>The fighting with the Ilysian Punks had yet to spread through the whole district, with only the northern blocks embroiled in conflict. Damian, Monica, and Niko were in charge of the defense, helping save the local residents as well as stem the incoming assault of the Ilysian Punks.</p><p>However, they were clearly far outnumbered—it was a nearly three-to-one disadvantage. What helped the Seven Snakes hold their ground was the armor and handguns provided to them, allowing them to survive for longer than expected.</p><p>Damian gritted his teeth as he activated the “Harden” engraving on his body, protecting himself from a gunshot as he fought in the ruined Golden Snake casino. The engraving had boosted his internal arcia energy, along with the nonstop training in the arcite chamber. </p><p>Grabbing a half-broken metal chair, he swung it around as a weapon, knocking out two punks onto the ground as the rest of his crew clashed in an all-out melee brawl. Countless casino chips and cards were scattered on the ground as the Ilysian Punks continued their objective of wrecking every Seven Snakes hideout and business. </p><p>Damian continued undeterred, focusing on making sure none of the associates under him died by blocking for them. The enemy squad leader cursed as he checked his arcite fuel pack’s level, being the only one with an arctech pistol.</p><p>With a loud roar, Damian immediately targeted him and charged, slamming into his waist and tackling him onto the ground. The arctech pistol was knocked out of his hand, disconnecting from the arcite fuel pack and clattering against the floor amid the sounds of yelling and punches. The two enemy gang members grappled each other in a desperate life-or-death match, trying to suffocate each other.</p><p>Damian’s eyes landed on the arctech pistol lying on the corner, reaching out with one hand to try and grab it. They tussled and tumbled on the ground, throwing punches at each other while both of them scrambled for the arctech pistol.</p><p>The enemy squad leader managed to grab the pistol again, desperately trying to reconnect it with his fuel pack, when he realized his fuel pack had already been crushed by Damian. The momentary shock left him open, allowing Damian to deliver a rapid combo of three punches and knock him down again. “Stay down, cunt.”</p><p>The enemy squad leader tried to get up but was suddenly hit on the head by a metal pipe that nearly caved his skull in and caused blood to spurt through his hair. “THIS IS FOR MARTHA, YOU FUCK!” Alex slammed the pipe down repeatedly, bellowing out his rage.</p><p>Damian did not stop him. He himself was also angered at the Ilysian Punks for what they had done to Keith. He checked in with the rest of his crew, of which five were seriously injured. “Head back to the shelter and get more health potions.” </p><p>While the rest of the associates complied and carried the wounded, Alex did not listen, continuing to hit the Ilysian Punks squad leader in the face, mashing it into a mess of meat. “Alex. Alex. HEY, ALEX, STOP!” Damian shouted and grabbed Alex. “You’re injured too! Think of your daughters; they still want you alive back at the shelter!”</p><p>Alex was about to shrug him off until he yelled out in pain as Damian poked a finger in Alex’s gaping wound on his waist. “There’s plenty more of these fuckers to take revenge on. You need to stay alive!”</p><p>“Huff… Huff… You’re right. Sorry.” Alex took a deep breath and staggered toward the exit of the casino, nearly fumbling onto the floor before Damian quickly supported him. </p><p>The crew headed back to the shelter, rotating with another squad, which headed out to defend them. Already, the exhaustion was visible on the Seven Snakes associates, barely propped up by the Stamina Potions. However, the potions did not alleviate the mental fatigue from the close-quarters combat in the city. </p><p>At the Lusty Arcian, Niko and Slavin were involved in a desperate, protracted battle, both sides firing at each other in the large, expansive lobby of the beauty school, with broken pots and mirrors strewn on the floor. Makeshift barricades and tables were used as cover that Niko crouched behind. In his right hand was a handgun crafted by Kyle. </p><p>“How long more till the Red Lions attack the Ilysian Punks?! They must know we’re in shit by now!” Niko roared into his arctech radio as yet another shot whizzed past his cover.</p><p>[I don’t know, but the Red Lions don’t seem to be making a single move!]</p><p>“WHAT?! Then what the hell are we buying time for?!” Niko cursed. “We’re going to lose the Lusty Arcian and maybe even the Seductive Serpent at this rate!”</p><p>[There are even bigger issues—there’s a fifty-man-strong squad from the Ilysian Punks moving to the south of us!]</p><p>Niko’s face baulked. He was under the impression that the force attacking them right now was the main force. <em>There’s more?!</em></p><p>[Sasha and I will handle it.] Kyle suddenly spoke on the communication channel. </p><p>On the roof of a building, Kyle laid down flat and mounted his arctech railgun, aiming down an open street. He peered through the scope, zooming in on the approaching Ilysian Punks.</p><p>Five squads marched down the open streets, all far more armored and equipped than the punks attacking in the north. Kyle noticed a wagon being escorted in the middle of their formation filled with arcite fuel packs, supposedly serving as their mobile supply station. </p><p>Kyle marked the five squad leaders but focused on one, who he fired the first bullet at. With a significant recoil, the metal ball nearly broke the speed of sound, hurtling toward the Ilysian Punks formation. </p><p>In an instant, the metal ball tore a hole through the squad leader’s head, killing him before he could even react. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Ilysian Punks Squad Leader”</p><p></p><p>“Fuck, the long-range cannon is here! Get to cover!” </p><p>Kyle fired two more times, killing yet another squad leader while missing another as the Ilysian Punks broke formation, sprinting all over the place. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Ilysian Punks Squad Leader”</p><p></p><p>The Ilysian Punks began to break into the nearby buildings and shops, using them as cover as they moved from door to door or through the alleyways to stay out of Kyle’s line of sight. </p><p>Kyle immediately unmounted the arctech railgun and began to head down to the ground floor himself. “Sasha, hunt them one by one before they spread too far into the district!”</p><p>[Yes, sir.] Sasha was already on the way there. This time, she wore a full coat, with the interior layered with arctech armor. The armor barely slowed her down as she sprinted down the streets toward the closest squad, who were disorganized as their leader had just collapsed. </p><p>The shop owners cowered in fear behind the cashier as half of an Ilysian Punks squad barged into the bakery. They quickly closed the door behind them, barricading themselves in as they hauled the shelves. “Shit, what do we do now? Our leader is dead. The arctech radio is on his body!”</p><p>Before anyone could offer their opinion or suggestion, Sasha kicked her way through the store glass, shattering the window. With a handgun in her hand, she fired three rounds in rapid succession at the closest Ilysian Punk—two in the body, one in the head. </p><p>She then ducked as another punk swung his crowbar at her head. Taking advantage of her position, she smashed her leg into his groin and deflected a punch coming from the side. In a flurry of jabs, punches, and kicks, she quickly knocked out four members. </p><p>The last surviving member ran out into the streets, yelling at the other Ilysian Punks. “The assassin is here! The assassin is here!”</p><p>Instead of chasing him down the streets, Sasha instead chose to exit the bakery through the back alleyways, trying to flank around and target another squad. However, the moment she turned the corner, a familiar metal gauntlet knocked right into her left shoulder, sending her soaring into the air as she twisted her body into recovery, the armor mitigating some of the damage. </p><p>“So we meet again, <em>assassin</em>. How much did the Seven Snakes pay you? Was it worth your life?” Makoa grinned, nine punks standing behind him in the alleyway with their arctech pistols at the ready. “Shoot her.”</p><p>Sasha gritted her teeth and activated her breastplate’s ability, sending out three dark-green projectiles that countered the volley of shots. However, six shots made it through, with three missing her and the remaining three nailing her in the thighs and waist, causing her to stagger onto the ground on one knee. </p><p>Makoa motioned with a single hand, the Ilysian Punks moving forward to finish her off. Sasha’s eyes burn with determination, unwilling to go down without a fight. </p><p>As the first knife was thrust at her, she deftly dodged and twisted the wrist holding the knife, forcing the attacking punk to drop it. She moved fluidly as she avoided and weaved through the attacks, parrying and slamming them into the walls. The healing engraving on her back worked overtime, but with the bullets lodged deep in her body, the wounds couldn’t be fully healed, causing her movement to slow down over time. </p><p>The pain surging from the embedded bullets caused her to falter slightly, a hit from a metal crowbar landing right on her back and slamming against the armor with a dull thud. Before she could recover her posture and counterattack, Makoa suddenly lunged toward her, delivering a flurry of punches that caved in her armor, shredding her full coat apart to reveal the dents underneath. </p><p>However, before Makoa could follow up, a loud, familiar bang slammed into his energy shield from behind, staggering him. <em>The long-range cannon—what?! </em>He turned around and saw who it was. “The Seven Snakes leader? GET HIM!” </p><p>The squad members turned and rushed the shooter, but the handgun in his left shot with precision, firing three times in quick succession. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Ilysian Punks Thug”</p><p></p><p>The remaining squad members were undeterred and rushed at him, swinging wildly from all angles. Kyle dropped his handgun onto the floor and wielded his arctech railgun with both hands, using it like a blunt staff. </p><p><em>Penchant for Violence.</em></p><p>His body surged with strength as his muscles slightly enlarged, and his perception was also mildly improved. With the additional free points added to the stats, the  boost was becoming more apparent to Kyle. Even his brain seemed to run at a faster speed, allowing him to react faster. <em>This is like a Galactic Era combat stimulant.</em></p><p>The first attacker gritted his teeth and swung a crowbar from the right, but the reach failed to hit Kyle as he took a step back.</p><p>He jabbed the barrel of the railgun into the stomach of the first attacker like a spear before swinging it down on another attacker, coming at him from another side in a downward hit. He immediately swiveled to use his railgun’s body to block a bullet fired by a punk who had managed to reload during the fight. </p><p>Kyle charged forward with the railgun, slamming its body into the nearest attackers and crushing their bones with a single hit. A solid jab was enough to cause a punk to be knocked out of the fight, whimpering on the ground from the pain. </p><p>Makoa was astonished by the sheer strength Kyle possessed despite his lean stature. <em>Where is he getting this power from? He doesn’t even have an arcite fuel pack! Is he a mage?</em></p><p>Kyle slammed the butt of his railgun down on an incapacitated punk’s neck, killing him instantly. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
