<p>Chapter  12: Arcite Technology</h1></p><p>Wrent fiddled with a Stamina Potion in his hand, sitting at the end of a long table in a well-furnished room. “Have any of the alchemists replied? I want to know if the potions they are providing are complete knockoffs. A twenty-man team should <em>not </em>be able to produce five hundred a day.” </p><p>It had been less than two days since they signed the contract, but Wrent had yet to distribute the Stamina Potions to his gang members for fear of them being poisoned. Such an outrageous production rate was banned by the Alchemists’ Guild—anyone flouting this rule was either an ostracized alchemist or someone trying to pull a quick one.</p><p>“Boss, our in-house alchemists are all currently busy and will respond in two weeks’ time.” The Red Lions’ main headquarters were still involved in violent conflict with the Ilysian Punks and the Wretches. Wrent had not yet been requested to join the conflict; his controlled district was not adjacent to any of the fighting zones. </p><p>“How about Haui? Has he replied?”</p><p>“We provided him with a few samples, and he has verified that they are legitimate, albeit with a lower efficiency than his. It could be said to be extremely diluted but still effective.”</p><p><em>So the Seven Snakes are mass-producing it but with a much lower quality than if done by a certified alchemist…</em> “If Haui says it’s okay, then we can use it. Our priority is to distribute them to our members first for enhanced training and preparation. We need everyone ready to assault the Seven Snakes at the end of the non-aggression pact.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>If everything goes to plan, the initial samples their alchemists have received won’t be the Euria-infused ones, seeing as the first three crates are completely clean. Suppose it’s Haui who is testing; that would be even better.</em> Kyle tapped the table, thinking. It’s been two days since the start of the contract.</p><p>An associate entered, passing Kyle a few replies from the other gangs. He opened them, reading the contents before calling Keith into the room.</p><p>“The new recruits won’t have time to prepare for the battle. The other gangs have agreed to purchase Strength Potions from us at a fixed rate for the next month. Get the new recruits to begin production on a separate line. Follow the exact method I did for the Stamina Potions, but no Euria this time.”</p><p>Kyle had sent a contract proposal, undercutting the market price of the Strength Potions with a discount of ten percent and selling them for nine hundred rakels each. <em>This shouldn’t rock the market too much. </em></p><p>“Sir, are we not planning to get the other gangs addicted?”</p><p>“Not yet. Let’s not burn any bridges this early and focus on earning money first. The faster we deliver the batch of Strength Potions, the more cash we will have on hand to supply our fighters and operations.”</p><p>Keith agreed and headed to the common area to set up the production lines, while Kyle considered his war plan. With the potions secured and a revenue source established, the supply contracts with the other gangs and the brothel’s imminent expansion would cause his current pile of cash to skyrocket. </p><p>Nevertheless, he had to consider the method by which he defeated the Red Lions. Showing off too much would prompt the top leader of the Red Lions to intervene and most likely crush them in one fell swoop.</p><p>He knew the Red Lions at large were engaged in an open conflict with the Ilysian Punks and Wretches, which gave him more wiggle room. However, they were not the only party involved; the local enforcers and maybe even the Ardent Cretins were watching him as well. Any actions taken would cause ripples, the consequences of which Kyle remained unsure due to his short time spent in the city.</p><p>Either way, he needed to ensure a clear combat advantage if he wanted to be able to control the flow of the fight. <em>Time to look for new advantages I can get.</em></p><p>Kyle had Damian bring him to the nearest arctech dealer he could find. The shop was situated in the corner of the food market, with multiple types of armor and household appliances on display, all of which were powered by various forms of arcia; this was where Keith bought the arcite stoves. </p><p>The dealer wore a simple cloak, the glint of steel armor shining underneath. His demeanor and countenance hinted at a military background; the man might have been a former shock trooper for the Count of Raktor. They briefly locked eyes, their intentions exchanged without words. </p><p><em>Let’s not pick a fight first.</em> Kyle focused on gathering information through the holographic interface. He picked up a few items, reading their descriptions intently.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Glacial Defensive Bracelet (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Slow those who would stop you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> +2 STR, +2 VIT. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Glacial Defense</strong> : Imparts a slow chilling effect onto enemies who hit any part of the engraving. Can be resisted based on vitality. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 2 MP. <strong>Duration</strong>: 2 seconds. <strong>Cooldown</strong> per target: 10 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Aero Shoes (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">For swift feet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> +4 AGI, +1 CHA. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Sprint</strong>: Allows the wielder to move faster.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 2 MP. <strong>Duration</strong>: 15 seconds. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 60 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Chest Plate of Strength (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A generic plate engraved with a strengthening mechanism.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> +5 STR, +5 VIT. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Strength</strong>: Allows the wielder to increase strength for as long as arcia is provided. Warning — arcite fuel is suggested. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 10 MP.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle inspected the chest plate, noticing it was fairly intricate. Engravings similar to the metal pipe he had ran all over the surface and interior, along with what seemed like two electrical terminals meant to be connected to something else that powered the piece.</p><p>“Ah, you’ll need an arcite fuel pack for that.” The dealer pointed to a basic waist belt filled with canisters of a mild, cobalt-blue liquid that pulsated slowly. Kyle recognized it to be of the same arcite glow that currently powered his potion stoves, albeit more powerful and efficient. <em>Seems like there are different grades of arcite fuel—in solid or in liquid.</em></p><p>“How much for it?”</p><p>“Well, normal civilians aren’t supposed to have their own combat fuel packs without a license, but we both know we’re well beyond <em>normal</em>, don’t we? Sixty thousand.”</p><p>Kyle’s face didn’t show any reaction, but he internally winced at the price. As much as the brothel was currently making, it didn’t seem feasible to buy the fuel pack. Furthermore, being exposed for having a fuel pack while on a shaky gang foundation might incite the enforcers to act against him. <em>I’ve already spent enough bribing them.</em></p><p>The dealer noted Kyle’s reluctance. “You can run the other two items without arcite fuel, but that’s all dependent on how much… <em>natural energy</em> your body has.” </p><p><em>It seems like he’s referring to the MP stat I’ve been seeing. I have zero right now. How do I increase it?</em> Kyle nodded in response to the dealer before leaving. The prices of the other two items were also in the tens of thousands, representing a significant investment that he wanted to mull over first. </p><p>Kyle continued to browse the other items until he spotted something that took him by surprise. <em>Huh. Did not expect to find this here.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Enchanted Flintlock Pistol (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>An arcia-gorging device that shoots pellets at high speeds. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Buckshot</strong>: Accelerate muzzle-loaded pellets at high speeds, causing damage on impact. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 25 MP.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The dealer scoffed at the gun as Kyle examined it. “Bah! I’ve been trying to get rid of that pistol for ages now. Nobody around can even use it, and it cost me far too much to acquire in the first place.”</p><p>“Nobody uses guns around here?”</p><p>“There aren’t any laws against wielding pistols, only laws against using military guns. The Count has much better guns being used. But seeing as you’re too poor to buy a fuel pack, you might as well forget about <em>this</em>.” The dealer shooed him off.</p><p>Kyle mulled as he walked back to the base. “Damian, how much is the gun and who else uses them?”</p><p>“Within the city, only the top of the enforcers, sir. But even <em>they </em>don’t have the energy to arm themselves with pistols and use them; it simply draws too much arcia energy and takes time to reload. The design and manufacture of such arctech is still far too complicated for factories to produce. I’ve heard the military has made some headway in improving the guns, but for now, we’re stuck with this.”</p><p>Kyle noted the information Damian had given him. <em>So it’s essentially a flintlock pistol that uses arcia instead of gunpowder. </em>Naturally, with his knowledge from the Galactic Era, it would be a cinch to dominate the market with high technology and his rudimentary understanding. But until he figured out what the current military technology was, he wouldn’t attempt to manufacture any guns. Too big of a jump would open up a whole other can of worms, and he already had his hands full dealing with the Red Lions. <em>None of the technology here is combustion based, so showing up with gunpowder will draw too many eyes. Best not go that route.</em></p><p>Returning to the base, Kyle laid out the three arctech items he had personally appropriated from Riker and Lionel: the Breastplate of Nullification, Enchanted Flaming Hammer, and Enchanted Metal Pipe.</p><p>Each item required MP to activate their skills. He had witnessed Lionel activating the hammer and Wrent wearing an armor suit that clearly had arctech capabilities. <em>Even with the Strength Potion, I’m at a disadvantage. When fighting, I can’t use the system interface to determine their effects beforehand without touching them. </em></p><p>“Statistics.”</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">* * *</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle frowned, but all hope was not yet lost. Based on his understanding of how titles worked, he had a rough guess at an alternative way to proceed. <em>Best ask the locals.</em></p><p>“Are there any items that boost the… natural energy of someone?” Kyle asked Damian and Keith. </p><p>Damian’s mouth dropped while an excited expression came over Keith’s face. “By Yual, Alvin! You’re back!” Damian reached forward to hug Kyle in what was to be a touching reunion but instead found himself facing the ceiling of the office, his arm locked.</p><p>“I already told you to call me Kyle or sir.”</p><p>Damian and Keith’s enthusiasm dimmed, and Damian slowly stood up. They were a bit shaken and glanced at each other with a knowing expression. “Sir, Slavin at the brothel has a few types of… erm… artifacts of a certain nature that might boost your lifestyle,” Damian replied with a hint of understanding.</p><p>“I understand if you want to let off some steam before the big fight.” Keith nodded in agreement as though the two brothers were wise men instructing Kyle about his destiny, stroking a non-existent beard.</p><p>“What the hell are you two on about? I’m talking about using arctech.”</p><p>“Oh. Right. Sorry. It might be worth a shot to try to find Ulon’s private stash then. It’s where your current necklace came from.”</p><p>“Haven’t we already auctioned or trashed most of it?” Kyle recalled disliking the useless trinkets and ornaments, and when he touched them, an interface didn’t pop up.</p><p>“No, those are just the public ones. I don’t know too much about it, but I do know it’s somewhere in the room. Though it is just a rumor I heard from other gang members. It may not be true.”</p><p>The three of them scoured the private room where Kyle was sleeping, eventually finding a wooden box in a bookcase embedded into the wall.</p><p>Keith had stars in his eyes, no doubt waiting to see what valuable items there were. “This is exciting! Maybe we can pawn some of it.” He rubbed his hands together feverishly.</p><p>Damian noticed the box was neither secured nor locked. “He probably thought no one would steal anything.”</p><p>They opened it to reveal a massive pile of junk, all useless trinkets. Kyle methodically went through them one by one, irked at the moldy condition of many of the statues. Soon he held a statue of a penis with stains on it, slightly used. He quickly handed it over to Keith, who had long lost the stars in his eyes and nearly gagged when he held it.</p><p>After sorting through more than a hundred objects, Kyle soon found a sapphire ring with a golden band. It appeared to be engraved, but it had somehow worn away over time. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Magus Ring of Theorin (Intermediate)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A ring from a former wielder of arcia.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> +5 MAX MP, +25% MP recovery rate.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>That’s a tiny amount…</em> Kyle immediately put the ring on his right hand, and felt a surge of what the denizens of this world called arcia energy rush through his veins like a hit of an exotic stimulant. It was minuscule in effect, but he could already tell his body had improved. He his fingers, noticing the existence of something else coursing through his muscles, though he could not pinpoint exactly what it was, where it was, and how fast it was moving. <em>Interesting… I don’t recall any base humans having such a feature.</em> Kyle sorted through the rest of the stash, only finding one book of interest. It was an intricately bound tome, complete with a metal binder and leather covers filled with engravings. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>A Treatise on Arcia by Theorin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>An incomplete guide on wielding internal arcia</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The theories are outdated but still provide a good baseline understanding.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>“My God! I didn’t know this still existed!” Damian exclaimed as he wiped the dust off the old tome. “Theorin was the first gang leader of the Seven Snakes more than twenty years ago. He was a natural-born wielder of arcia, a mage if you will. This allowed him to dominate the districts before arcite fuel became popularized. Didn’t expect Ulon to have held on to it.”</p><p>Kyle opened the tome, noting the complexity of the words and some of the more complicated terminology and formulas that would take time for him to understand. He would need Keith’s assistance to translate it. </p><p>With this book and the new ring, he could potentially begin to utilize more arctech in the future. Even <em>he </em>understood the limitation of his fighting skills against items that could impart special effects. <em>With this, it’ll be an easy win. </em><h1><a id="_vc3rrmwfj7t3"></a>
