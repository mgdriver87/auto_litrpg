<p>Chapter  9: Red Lion</h1></p><p>“SEVEN SNAKES! COME OUT!” a man clad in reddish armor bellowed outside the Seven Snakes’ base, attracting the attention of many passersby. He was flanked by a dozen lightly armored individuals, all bearing the insignia of the Red Lions.</p><p>Many of the onlookers watched intently from a safe distance. It had been barely a day since the battle in the alleyway, but the word of Kyle’s prowess had already spread through the district. It was no surprise that the Red Lions would come to harass the Seven Snakes after such a harrowing defeat.</p><p>The man continued yelling. “COME OUT NOW! OR ARE YOU TOO SCARED TO DEFEND YOUR OWN TURF?”</p><p>Suddenly, the entrance to the base swung open, revealing a disgruntled Kyle who had just woken up, his eyes slightly closed. “Who are you?” he asked.</p><p>The man was stumped for only a brief moment before cackling loudly. Every movement of his seemed to be geared toward showmanship, showing off his equipment and his dominance over the ordinarily dressed Kyle.</p><p>Kyle squinted. <em>He’s putting on a performance for reputation and rumors. Typical.</em></p><p>“Don’t you know? I am the great Wrent, Left Paw of the Red Lions! It seems you’ve been taking good care of my boys.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And?” Wrent’s eyebrows twitched at the defiant tone, but he resumed his haughty attitude. “I believe <em>you </em>are keeping them prisoner, and <em>we </em>would like them back. I’m sure you wouldn’t want to cause an incident on this fine day, would you?”</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How much would it cost in rakels to buy your members?”</p><p>Wrent’s expression darkened. “Are you implying that we, the honorable Red Lions, would ever be willing to sell our—” A dark-yellow potion sailed through the air, with Wrent stumbling to catch it.</p><p>Just as he was about to berate Kyle for tossing random objects at him, he took another look at the item in question, staring intently. “This is… a Stamina Potion!” Wrent was no fool—he had already heard rumors of the Seven Snakes selling them through the brothel.</p><p>“There’s more where that came from. How many would suffice?”</p><p>Wrent coughed, his eyes darting around. “Perhaps it would be best if we discussed this inside, away from prying eyes.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The two of them entered the office, with Damian standing guard outside.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Ulon to fall so soon,” Wrent remarked. He glanced around the room and saw most of the usual ornaments that Ulon had loved to flaunt were missing. “Did you come from another gang? I don’t recall seeing anyone like you around.”</p><p>“No, I have been in the gang for a while now. I just felt I could do better,” Kyle replied, his back exposed to Wrent, who was eyeing him like a predator.</p><p>“Are you not afraid I would kill you right here?” Wrent sneered, his right hand slightly rubbing the pommel of an engraved, ruby-encrusted sword with a wide grin. </p><p>“You can try, if you want. I’m sure it’ll do wonders for your reputation,” Kyle replied apathetically, not the least afraid. </p><p>The sheer confidence exuded by Kyle frightened Wrent, causing him to be markedly more cautious. <em>This man isn’t the same as Ulon. The slow method may not work for him. I’ll have to fleece him as much as I can. There’s no way the debt Ulon racked up is gone within less than two weeks. I know they still owe a million to the Crimson Swords.</em></p><p>Wrent ran his hands over the arm of the guest chair before removing his sword belt and sitting down. “Perhaps your death does not affect my reputation as much as you think. No one knows you’re the new leader yet.”</p><p>“Enough posturing. We’re both businessmen here. Let’s get to the point. How many?” Kyle began.</p><p><em>He has an intelligent head on his shoulder, and he immediately knew from the start that I didn’t care about the prisoners. A dumber gang leader would have refused based on pride. If we weren’t enemies, I would have recruited him right away.</em> Wrent was never worried about the prisoners. Kyle could kill them for all he cared, as long as he got “compensation.” The Red Lions were a business, not a group based on friendship.</p><p>Wrent still had interest in how Kyle was getting so many potions. He had heard the reports of the brothel giving potions to their loyal customers, which prompted him to send a dozen members in the first place. Of course, he planned to use his weight to pressure Kyle into giving him more potions than was reasonable. The Red Lions could then easily sell them off in a heartbeat or use it in their own training. </p><p>Wrent tried to pry deeper. “You’re not getting these potions from Haui, are you?”</p><p>“That’s a trade secret. How many?”</p><p>Wrent remained silent for a moment, calculating in his head. <em>A ridiculous amount should suffice. If he rejects, it’ll tank his reputation, and I’ll increase the rate of harassment whether or not he releases the prisoners. If he accepts, the gang will be financially ruined, and it’ll be an easy win.</em></p><p>“Five hundred Stamina Potions,” Wrent declared. Based on Haui’s pricing scheme, it was close to three hundred thousand rakels’ worth of potions. With Seven Snakes in debt, it was nearly impossible for them to even have that much in stock.</p><p>“Done. You’ll have your full stock in ten days. Let me draft a contract.” Kyle retrieved a placeholder contract, filling in the details before handing it over to Wrent for inspection. </p><p><em>He caved that easily? The potions are worth three hundred thousand! Is he stealing them from an alchemist I’ve never heard of?</em></p><p>Wrent was still stunned when he read the contract. He checked over the clauses carefully, noting that everything was in order. “A non-aggression pact over the course of the contract…” This meant the Red Lions could not attack the Seven Snakes as long as they adhered to the contract terms. <em>Are my members really that valuable to him? What is he using them for?</em></p><p>As much as they were criminal gangs profiteering from illegal goods, contracts between gangs had to be adhered to—it was an issue of reputation. Any gang that thoughtlessly broke a truce or ceasefire would immediately lose the trust of both the people and other gangs, throwing them into isolation. Even merchants wouldn't dare trade with them unless coerced by force. Going against a contract signed willingly was a surefire way to have enemies gang up against the one who broke the contract. </p><p>Three hundred thousand rakels’ worth of potions was an eye-watering sum to Wrent, and he was basically getting it for free. “I accept.” Wrent readily signed the agreement. <em>The non-aggression pact is but a façade. The real war is fought on the open market with our businesses. If he’s as smart as I think he is, I’ll need to expedite my plan.</em></p><p>“Good. Each day at dusk, send five people to collect fifty potions at this meeting point. Pleasure doing business with you.” Kyle led Wrent out. </p><p>When Wrent left, he let out a hearty laugh, attracting onlookers who were curious about the resolution. “Seems like you got a good head on your shoulders, Seven Snakes. Smart of you to appease us so readily. Let’s move out!” He ordered his men to march back to their district. </p><p><em>A showman through and through. </em>Kyle returned to the common room, noticing a worried Damian on the side. “Sir, what was the agreement? Did we go into more debt?”</p><p>“A ten-day truce, along with fifty potions delivered a day.”</p><p>Damian was equally shocked, but not for the same reasons as Wrent was. “What? That’s it? We churn out two hundred a day, even while training!”</p><p>“It’s their loss. This gives us time to prepare, though we must shore up our finances. We’ll begin combat training immediately—we’re on a timer now. For the potions, make sure the first three deliveries are not Euria-infused. We will only infuse them randomly from the fourth day onward. Don’t want their alchemist to spot too much.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Kyle acted as an instructor for the rest of the morning, teaching the associates fighting skills. He used the prisoners as dummies, sending the associates in one by one to beat them up while continuously healing them. The rest were divided into sparring pairs. Kyle focused on sparring with Damian, drilling fighting basics into him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Healer (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>After lunch, Damian led the training, allowing Kyle to focus on preparing for the end of the truce. There was no doubt in his mind that the Red Lions would begin to pressure them now that they were well aware of their ability to produce this many potions. <em>As long as we can hold on for three days after the end of the truce, it’s a win for us.</em></p><p>Keith was in Kyle’s office, racking his brains over the gang’s finances and equipment, his head resting in his hands. “Is it doable?” Kyle asked.</p><p>“To get a similar armor set like the Red Lions? I don’t think so. It’s far too expensive.”</p><p>“Hmm…” Kyle pondered. He needed to boost the combat capability of his men before the fight broke out. If they couldn’t procure enchanted armor, what other methods did he have? </p><p>“Keith, one more task for you. Set up an induction program for new members and procure a few armbands with the logo of the Seven Snakes on them. Have it done by tomorrow.”</p><p>“New members?! We’re so tiny. Who would even want to join us?”</p><p>Kyle glared at his underling, who immediately zipped his mouth and nodded.</p><p><em>More members can help bulk up our numbers, but we need a qualitative improvement across the board. </em>Combat training could only last for ten days—not long enough to drill proper fighting skills into the associates. Sure, the physical training regimen had been running for two weeks, but that didn’t directly translate into fighting potential. Kyle needed instantaneous improvements.</p><p>His mind thought about the game-like interface that he now had. Killing people would earn him free stat points and even titles occasionally. However, the points only gave him a slight marginal benefit. It wasn’t worth the potential consequence of enforcers breathing down his neck for random murders happening across the sector—even <em>he </em>didn’t think he could cover up every kill.</p><p>The number of people he would have to kill in ten days would be cataclysmic to reach a level where he could take on the entirety of the Red Lions. He needed something different. </p><p>The main way to solve this would be to get more potions, but as it stood, there was no chance in hell that Haui had not heard about the deal with the Red Lions or the Lusty Arcian selling cheap stamina potions for repeat customers. With the absurd number of potions being supplied for “free,” the local market for potions must have been in peril by now. </p><p>Kyle decided to tackle this problem head-on, bringing a few associates to visit Haui’s shop. He stood just beyond the defensive line of arcia traps that surrounded the alchemist’s house, while the private guards immediately came out, brandishing their swords and maces, ready to fight.</p><p>The locals around the food market scampered away, afraid of getting caught in the ensuing fight, while a few brave souls remained to watch the outcome. Even the local enforcers didn’t dare get in between, keeping a clear distance as they carefully observed, reporting the meeting to their superiors.</p><p>Haui stepped out of the store in his alchemist robes. “I was expecting you to come soon. Are you planning to raze or to negotiate?” <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">* * *</p>
