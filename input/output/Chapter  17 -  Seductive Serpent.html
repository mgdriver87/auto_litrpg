<p>Chapter  17: Seductive Serpent</h1></p><p><em>A few days after…</em></p><p>Damian settled himself into the chair gingerly, reveling in the soft, smooth texture of the velvet. “Look at me, Keith! I’m the king now. King of the District!”</p><p>“You’d better get out of that chair before Kyle comes back.” Keith sighed as he continued pouring over financial reports and inventory lists. </p><p>“What? Can’t the underboss relax a little? I’ve been in this gang for so many years—I think my back deserves a bit of velvet.”</p><p>“We’re not out of the woods yet. We still owe a debt to the Crimson Swords—they are coming to collect the interest soon. If you really were the underboss, you’d get off your ass and check for opportunities!” Keith shot back, obviously stressed. </p><p>“Relax. As long as Kyle is at the helm, we’ll be fine.” Damian’s faith in Kyle was obviously at an all-time high due to the success against the Red Lions. At the start, he was simply watching and not fully committed as of yet. Being the underboss of a small gang was significant to him, but not as much as one would expect when the gang was only thirty members strong. But being the underboss of a gang that had taken down the Left Paw of the Red Lion? That was different. </p><p>“I’m flattered by the belief placed in me. Nonetheless, I believe that is my chair.”</p><p>Damian shot right out of the chair, quickly stepping out of the way as Kyle walked in. Keith also stood up, but Kyle waved at them to stand down. “No time for decorum. We have issues to discuss. We have yet to nail down exactly how to expand our operations. Let’s focus on that.”</p><p>Each of them took a seat, with Damian and Keith sitting opposite Kyle around the office table. </p><p>“As of now, we only have two businesses under our wing—a pub and a brothel. Which—”</p><p>“You mean the Lusty Arcian?” Keith interjected.</p><p>“Yes.” Kyle could have sworn they had an obsession with saying the name but chose to ignore it. “Which is far from enough to generate the profits necessary to pay off the Crimson Swords. We have less than three months to clear the debts, and due to the Alchemists’ Guild’s restrictions, our potion contracts are severely limited.”</p><p>Kyle didn’t really see a way around the restrictions. Sure, he could ignore the ban, but only if he had enough power and connections himself. Defeating a subset of the Red Lions was far from becoming dominant enough to ignore such rules, so until then, he would have to play ball with Haui. </p><p>“We can look for other avenues,” Damian pointed out. “Now that we have a reputation, we can begin to spread our influence throughout the district. Perhaps even begin some additional protection rackets as well.”</p><p>“No protection rackets for now. Such an extortive method would only serve to turn the current populace against us. We must position the Seven Snakes as a force for good overall, something integral to the survival of the district. The moment the locals perceive that there are more cons to having us around than benefits, that is the moment we fall.” Kyle elaborated. <em>Perhaps that is why I fell as well in my last life. </em></p><p>Damian scratched his head, not sure of what else to suggest. Protection rackets had been his main job under Ulon and their primary source of income, so he was lost on what to do next.</p><p>“What we need to do is a bit of market research,” Kyle continued. “The potions are one good example of us being able to enter the market, but it is limited and hampered by a strong guild. That very limitation allows the price to be far higher than its cost, so products like that are desirable.” </p><p>Keith caught on quickly. “So basically anything that is prohibited under the Sanctum of Yual, correct?”</p><p>“Exactly. Any leads?” Kyle deferred to Damian and Keith, who were obviously more knowledgeable about the local area. </p><p>Keith offered another suggestion. “How about guns? We could try to break into the weapons market.”</p><p>“I recently heard about two inquisitors arriving in the sector. Rumor is they’re here about guns, though I don’t have any details.” Damian said, rejecting Keith’s suggestion. He always had his ear close to the ground, having many connections with the locals due to his long years in the gang, so he was always being told all sorts of rumors. </p><p>“Then it’s best not to enter the gun market until we know exactly what is happening.” Kyle didn’t want to poke the hornet’s nest, not right after the visit from Sebastian. “We need something far more lowkey, something that everyone is doing, so that no one will bat an eye at the Seven Snakes joining in.”</p><p>“Smuggling is an option. Human trafficking pays fairly well with the slave trade being ubiquitous in Raktor. Even small gangs here do it.”</p><p>“Out of the question—that would also piss off the locals, and we don’t have the manpower to operate in other districts either,” Kyle said. “Operating there would also piss off the gangs in charge. Far too dangerous. However, you mentioned the small thug groups here. How many of them are there?”</p><p>“Well, it can be assumed that every block has about one to two. Our district has about fifty-four blocks populated, with another twenty abandoned, now occupied by squatters and others. Many small groups flock here because of the lack of enforcement, primarily from us rather than the enforcers,” Keith replied.</p><p>Such a high ratio of gangs would be unheard of in the other districts. Kyle sighed at their abysmal lack of influence, contemplating his next step. He had initially improved the performance of the brothel thanks to the addictive stamina potions, so the logical next step would be to improve the performance of the pub. </p><p>“Keith, any financial report on the pub?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, but the report doesn’t really make much sense. Some months, the pub reports a one-to-one ratio of revenue and operating cost.”</p><p>“Down to the last rakel?”</p><p>Keith nodded, his response setting off alarm bells in Kyle’s head. <em>Someone has falsified the accounts. Even such a business should experience seasonal changes due to events and holidays.</em> Kyle assumed it was Ulon, but he couldn’t rule out the possibility that the pub’s manager was also involved. </p><p>“Let’s check the pub that we own before making our next move.”</p><p>“You mean the Seductive Serpent?”</p><p>“Who the hell is coming up with these names?”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Unlike the brothel, which was run by the competent Slavin, the pub was an absolute disgrace, a place fitting of the name “watering hole.” The décor was shabby, the lighting dim and flickering, and the entire place stank to high Sanctum of Yual. Empty cups were barely cleaned, with some being left on tables for weeks. Dried residue of piss and vomit lined the crevices between shoddy wooden planks, and Kyle found it hard to find a piece of wooden furniture that did not have some sort of large crack along its length. </p><p>Near the rear of the pub were three thick, long ropes hung from corner to corner in a drooping curve, upon which a few Seven Snakes members were sleeping. </p><p>“Do our members not have beds?” Kyle asked Damian as he noticed Niko dangling on the coarse rope and snoring away peacefully while a dribble of vomit seeped from his mouth, piling up in the belly button of another blackout drunk below him. </p><p>“They do, but many prefer this idea of hanging over a rope.” Damian shrugged before walking up to what could be barely described as a bartender and slapping him awake.</p><p>“I… uh… Who… What?” The bartender groaned as he rubbed his cheek gently… and fell off the rope onto the floor in shambles. Seeing the man struggling to get up, Kyle’s impression of him dropped significantly. <em>I can’t have my bartenders getting drunk themselves.</em></p><p>“Keith, check the finances. Where’s the manager?”</p><p>“Uhh, sir? This is the manager.” Damian pointed to the obviously drunk bartender, who was now staggering all over the place, banging his head on the wall and collapsing. </p><p>“That’s not good.” Kyle’s gaze slowly turned dark, a simmering rage building within him at the sheer incompetence. Compared to the Lusty Arcian, this pub was a hellhole.</p><p>“Sir. There’s no financial record kept here. Everything seems to be written in this notebook.” Keith handed over a stained notebook filled to the brim with the tabs of each customer. Kyle flipped through the book quickly, noticing almost nine-tenths of the customers were Seven Snakes members, causing his heart to sink.</p><p>Furthermore, none of the Seven Snakes members had actually paid their tabs. The operational cost seemed to have been entirely fueled by the loan taken out from the Crimson Swords. <em>This isn’t even skimming off the top in some self-interested scam—it’s a complete self-scam!</em> </p><p>Kyle wanted to tear the entire place apart. “There’s nothing seductive about this place at all! Why is it called the Seductive Serpent?!”</p><p>“It used to be quite the spot, back in its heyday,” Damian replied. “Sir.” He added quickly as Kyle threw him a furious glare. </p><p>“Then for our members to continue drinking here, the alcohol must be somewhat passable.” Kyle took a seat on one of the creaky barstools, motioning to Damian to serve a mug. Damian immediately knew what to do, heading back into the storehouse to crack open a keg. “You seem to know your way around the bar.”</p><p>“I used to bartend here before joining the Seven Snakes.” </p><p>As the beer sloshed out of the keg and into the mug, a rancid smell filled the room, causing even the usually stoic Kyle to cringe in disgust.</p><p>“I think the beer is fine; been drinking it for three years, you know? Better than the swill we get at the squatters area,” Damian remarked, handing the mug over to Kyle. “Don’t judge a beer by its, err… smell. Or taste. And color.”</p><p><em>Then what do I judge it by? The bubbles?! </em>Kyle grimaced, slowly sipping a mouthful and drinking it, his eyes closed. “Any other types?”</p><p>“We got ale as well.” Damian repeated the process, with Kyle taking yet another swig. The gang leader sat in silence, his eyes still closed in what seemed to be deep contemplation. Damian watched expectantly as Kyle didn’t show any further disgusted reactions, buoying his hopes of validation.</p><p>Instead, the leader opened his eyes and stared at Damian before letting out a deep sigh, his anger seemingly lost. “Remind me not to trust your tastebuds ever again.” He didn’t really blame Damian for it, seeing as Damian would have never tasted better alcohol in the first place. Kyle was simply far too used to hypercontrolled alcohol, brewed in microgravity to maximize yeast fermentation, and its replicable taste. </p><p>“Hey, come on! You might be the boss, but I won’t have my taste insulted. Plenty of other folks in the district love this!” Damian took a stance. As strong as his belief in Kyle was, there were just some things he wouldn’t budge on. </p><p>“Then why are these ‘plenty of other folks’ not filling this pub?”</p><p>“Well, we pretty much serve the same thing as other pubs.”</p><p>“Really? Show me.”</p><p>Without warning, an impromptu pub crawl began, with Kyle sampling various nearby pubs run by locals. The other customers gave them a wide berth, recognizing their recent victory against the Red Lions. Even though Damian was in the midst of trying to prove a point to Kyle, he relished in the influence and reputation that he had garnered for himself. </p><p>Keith, too, was amazed at the attention and respect that they were receiving. He was never one to stand in the spotlight, but for the young man craving validation, the attention soothed his ego in just the right way, his demeanor far more upright than it had been before.</p><p>On the fifth pub, Kyle knew he had lost the argument with Damian. Every pub indeed had a similar-tasting beer and ale to what the Seductive Serpent served. However, it was a good thing. <em>This means I have caught a potential market.</em></p><p>Just as Kyle was about to conclude the pub crawl, the bartender of the fifth pub stopped him for a moment, offering a new drink on the house. “Got a new supply coming in recently. It’s leagues better than the beer. Here, give it a try.”</p><p>Kyle glanced at the drink, noticing it was a distilled hard liquor. “Moonshine? You made this yourself?”</p><p>“No, I’ve been getting it from someone else. Bunch of ragtags in the abandoned blocks.”</p><p>“What’s their name?”</p><p>“Oh, I wouldn’t know much about it…” The bartender shrugged, his palm faced upwards in an obvious gesture, prompting Kyle to retrieve a few dozen rakels, placing them on the counter. With a swift motion, the bartender grabbed the coins and slid them into his pocket before leaning over and whispering, “From what I know, they ain’t a part of any gang, you know? They do their own thing. I mean everything—brewing, supply, and even scouting. Apparently, the leader is an expert in alcohol brewing. Heard he even had done proper university research on it!”</p><p>“Any ideas where they are?”</p><p>“I didn’t ask, but I’m sure you’ll find them around the area. Considering you haven’t encountered them yet, I’ll say the crew is top-notch too. Their scout is really good at observing and planning routes. I’ve never heard of them being accosted by an enforcer either.”</p><p>Intrigued, Kyle tipped the bartender again to learn more information. As soon as he got everything he needed, he patted Damian and Keith on the back, prompting them to take their leave.</p><p>“Time to go. We got some moonshiners to catch.”<h1><a id="_jdovrz8mdhy4"></a>
