<p>Chapter  80 - Roots</strong></p><p>In a sharp reversal of treatment, the Seven Snakes began to clamp down on angry residents and public dissent brutally, beating the protestors into submission with everything on hand. Homes and slums were raided, those who protested being arrested and thrown into poorly maintained cells where they were subjected to continuous torture and experiments, the addiction research still on-going.</p><p>&quot;The districts will now be under a new law. Anyone caught flouting the rules or opposing society at large will be beaten and imprisoned indefinitely. Choose your actions wisely. Security and stability will be restored.&quot; Kyle announced through the various media platforms, painting the protestors as the minority.</p><p>Some accepted the excuses, wishing for more security, while others felt constrained. Kyle did not care. The time for playing nice was now over, especially at such a critical juncture just before the demonstration of the knight armor suits to the military. <em>Almost as if it was on purpose.</em></p><p>Many of the prisoners were still defiant, planning their escape and trying to earn empathy from the jailors. Yet thanks to the improvement in the training regime for Seven Snakes recruits three weeks ago, they had no qualms about the horrible treatment that the protestors were receiving. In fact, their experience over the course of the month had hardened their views of the rest of the district, treating anyone who was not Seven Snakes lesser than themselves.</p><p>On-top of that, a clarification by Damian on who committed the murder helped to steel and assure the loyal recruits that they were in the right. Many of them who had worked in the job distribution center and elsewhere had first-hand experience of the sheer entitlement of applicants and small, petty criminals who refused to join the Seven Snakes.</p><p>&quot;Damn straight - finally some action! I'm sick and tired of bending over to these dumb peasants!&quot; The more bloodthirsty among the recruits echoed sentiments of violence and suppression, relishing in the gang's return to its roots.</p><p>However, as always, there were recruits who had second thoughts about the entire process and overarching goal that Kyle had in mind, wondering if they were going too far. &quot;We're practically performing illegal experimentation on prisoners!&quot;</p><p>Kyle had a simple solution for such individuals: he had them transferred to the Culdao Peaks, rotating the first batch of re-education members around.</p><p>The stint in the training caves worked like a charm, with the returning batch now hardened and seasoned soldiers, ready to act or kill at the drop of the hat. It took a bit of time for them to assimilate back into city life, but Kyle saw the entire program as a rousing success at breaking their spirits and immunizing them to the concept of death, albeit with a bit of trauma that was easily solved with alcohol and vices.</p><p>While the suppression of the protestors initially worked for the first few days, discontentment was starting to spread among the populace, creating strife between those who supported the Seven Snakes and those who opposed them. The ones caught in the middle were starting to lean against the rule of Kyle, mostly due to the oppressive continuous presence of Seven Snakes members watching their every move on the streets.</p><p>Yet despite the ability to simply send off dissidents into prison and training caves alike, handling the vipers was a whole another issue to solve. It became painfully obvious to Kyle that not all of the higher-ups were in agreement with the nature of his orders.</p><p>&quot;Sir, this is unsustainable in the long run. Eventually, a large portion of the population will try to break our control. If anything, this added resentment could be manipulated by our enemies.&quot; Keith protested the orders for violent suppression, with Reese and Eric supporting him.</p><p>Damian nodded in agreement. &quot;Keith is right, any further antagonism of the populace at large would erode the goodwill that we have worked so hard to build over time. Instead, we should focus on explaining the truth and appeasing them. Perhaps we can reach a compromise with-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I appreciate your opinions, but it is already far too late.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But we're being portrayed as the evil ones now. The landowners' association is already protesting to the Sanctum of Yual and Baron Cain for an armed intervention.&quot; Keith pressed his case, firmly believing Kyle was heading down the wrong path.</p><p>&quot;And are the enforcers responding to their request?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No, sir. No movement at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. Spread the word that those who are aligned with us will retain their wealth. Those who resist, have them arrested and their property seized.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you will need the Baron's approval first and foremost. All land deeds are issued under his name.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will handle the Baron myself, thank you very much.&quot; Kyle waved his hand dismissively, clearly frustrated by the doubt being levelled at him by the vipers.</p><p>&quot;Still-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Keith.&quot; Kyle interrupted Keith with a stern look, finally snapping. &quot;We are first and foremost an organization that prides itself on being the best, and I will do everything in my power to ensure we remain at the top. There will be no pandering to the weak, no concessions given to the vocal minority. I will not allow anything to disrupt the upcoming mock demonstration nor the sale of weapons. And I did not put you in charge of the businesses to question my orders repeatedly - once is more than enough. Do not think that just because I have shown favor to you in the past, that I will accept any and all opinions. If you do not want to execute the orders, there are plenty of others eager to take your position. Is that clear?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I... yes, understood, boss.&quot; Keith accepted it with a resigned look, returning to his work. It's been far too long since Kyle had exerted his authority like this, making the vipers half-forget that Kyle still had the final say in everything that the Seven Snakes did.</p><p>&quot;Damian, into my office, now. The rest of you, back to work.&quot; Kyle ordered, leaving the vipers outside as the door slammed shut.</p><p>&quot;Kyle must have gone power crazy. What happened to doing right by the people? He was always talking about balancing legal and illegal activities, yet now he's fully toppled over into violence.&quot; Keith grumbled as he returned to his desk. To him, Kyle's actions were erratic and uncharacteristic - rash orders and immediate bouts of violence were not how they had solved issues in the past. </p><p>Inside Kyle's private office, Damian too was conflicted internally. &quot;Sir, I apologize for my brother's actions-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I assume you are aligned with him as well?&quot; Kyle interrupted, pulling out two stained Seven Snakes recruit armbands, the same ones they had found at the site of Mr Stanley's execution.</p><p>&quot;There is merit to their concern; after all, the current orders run counter to our entire business philosophy that we have established in the months since the building of the shopping arcade. Perhaps if you would explain your actions and overarching plans a little, it would help to assuage the concerns of the vipers and others.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These armbands... do you know who issued them?&quot; Kyle seemingly ignored the comment, pointing towards the stained armbands.</p><p>&quot;I can have that checked against our logs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And who is in charge of our logs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That would be Niko, sir.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not him. He's the one doing the distribution to the recruits. These... these armbands were clearly not issued through an official ceremony by him nor you.&quot;</p><p>Damian's eyes widened at the implications that Kyle was insinuating. &quot;You're saying my brother is involved in this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps, perhaps not. There is a mole, but I don’t know how high or how deep it is. This is the real reason why I cannot divulge my overarching plans. Do you understand?&quot; Kyle clasped his hands together as he walked closer to Damian. &quot;I tell you this because I have placed my trust in you as the appointed underboss. But do not think for one second that I am tolerant of traitorous activities, no matter how benign the traitor thinks his actions are. Not even the underboss's brother.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I assure you, sir, Keith has no intention of betraying the Seven Snakes. As his older brother, I can vouch for his-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your words, not his.&quot; Kyle pointed out. &quot;Sometimes even brothers have their differences.&quot;</p><p>Damian wanted to retort, but he knew better than to push the matter even more. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now, the mole might be anyone else, but it is certainly one high up in the ranks with close ties to the logistics and deployment of manpower across our men. Either that or your brother is being framed. Regardless of who it is, until we discover the mole, you and I will keep it between us. Under no circumstances are you to explain the situation except with my prior approval. Understood? We don’t want to spook the mole before we find out who’s behind it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. Now, keep the other vipers in line, and keep an eye out for any suspicious activities.&quot; Kyle had Damian dismissed, and as soon as the underboss left the private office, Kyle was already going through the motions, checking his drawers and equipment and his possible escape routes. He scanned the rooftops beyond the glass wall of his office, searching for any observers or possible spies that might be watching in on them.</p><p>He methodically searched every nook and cranny of the office, looking for any recording devices or unknown arctech devices. While he had just explained to Damian that he trusted him as the underboss, deep down in his heart, Kyle still did not trust anyone within the Seven Snakes with his life. <em>Always have an escape route. Even at the cost of your followers.</em> There was no chance in hell he would subject himself to the same betrayal he experienced at the end of his former life.</p><p>With the office now scrubbed clean, and no obvious devices found, Kyle took stock of the scenario. He had a rough idea of what was being achieved, but it would still require more time and observation to truly understand the end goal and composition of his enemies. <em>Let's check the observation engravings of the execution site.</em></p><p>Unfortunately, the observation engravings did not reveal anything of worth, with none of the perpetrators visible in the recording. With no clues and no leads to go on, Kyle had no choice but to order Adrian to install as many light-capturers as they could afford in discreet locations, forming a surveillance network, waiting to catch the next event before it even happened.</p><p>An arctech radio call came in from Baron Cain, his voice clearly panicking. [Kyle, what the hell is happening over there? I'm getting flooded with complaints and petitions for your eradication from the South Sector! Did you really kill a landowner's entire family in cold blood? This is crossing the line.]</p><p>Kyle pondered for a second, before finally replying. &quot;The landowners are seeking to rile up the public. They've killed one of their own to blame the Seven Snakes, in an effort to discredit the weapons factory and our growing dominance of the district.&quot;</p><p>[What are you implying?]</p><p>&quot;If we do not control the landowners now, they will attempt to take over our businesses, at which point I will no longer be able to assist with the Aspis Weapons Factory. You will have to manage it yourself.&quot;</p><p>A poignant silence reigned on the other end of the line, Baron Cain clearly weighing the pros and cons of having Kyle out of the venture entirely, though there was not much to weigh. Without Kyle's input, Baron Cain would never be able to trump the other weaponsmiths as a standalone designing and manufacturing hub for weapons, only to be relegated to contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future.</p><p>[No, it's critical that you remain with the venture.]</p><p>A small grin erupted on Kyle's face, knowing he had steered the Baron to where he exactly wanted him. &quot;Then I will need a temporary approval to execute confiscation of assets should the landowner continue to stir political unrest and dissent among the populace.&quot;</p><p>[ONLY if they stir political unrest against the current order. Under no circumstances will the approval allow you to simply detain anyone.]</p><p>&quot;But of course. Please do add that clause into the approval as well. An announcement should be made as well to clear our name and inform the populace at large of such an agreement.&quot;</p><p>[.... Indeed, we should. But if I ever find out that you were the ones who truly executed the family, I will see to it that I personally eradicate the Seven Snakes with my own hands. Don’t think that there will always be goodwill between us. There is a line.] Baron Cain threatened before he hung up.</p><p>Kyle leaned back in his chair with a satisfied expression, having gotten what he needed. <em>The Baron is only worried about his public image. The Seven Snakes leaving the weapons factory joint venture and the newly announced housing project would result in a large humiliation city-wide.</em> While other criminal gangs might have disdained any official deals or compromises with the enforcers or the nobles, it was these very compromises that were now keeping the Seven Snakes in play and in control of its districts.</p><p><em>With every problem comes an opportunity in disguise.</em> As the other vipers were tearing their hair out at the seemingly desperate situation, Kyle knew that he had been given the greatest opportunity to solidify his control of the districts. With the landowners all now falling into his hands as soon as they made any attempts at resistance, he could claim and purchase any land deed at market price with Baron Cain's approval once it was confiscated.</p><p><em>Now that that is under control, it's time to focus on the weapons contract. With due time, the enemy will reveal themselves through their actions.</em></p><p>Yet, just as he was about to leave the shopping arcade, he suddenly heard something unexpected on the arctech radios playing in the office, some of the clerks listening attentively.</p><p>[In a shocking turn of events, former Versian President Johan has gone missing. The current suspect is Minister Dekar, who is now on the run and has been revealed to be taking bribes from Raktor as a compromise for the previous incident. Vice-President Monero is now temporarily in power, seeking to have elections running as soon as possible.]</p><p>[&quot;The news of this sudden betrayal by our very own Minister has brought great shame upon our country. It is my duty and honor as the temporary President to ensure that Versia will be able to navigate the uncertain future to come. Our borders and society shall be secured against foreign corruption and aggression, and together, we will build a better, more progressive society on the hard work of our forefathers before us.&quot;] Monero's voice crackled in the static, and while the clerks were ambivalent about the event, Kyle's face darkened tremendously. He knew that with Minister Dekar on the run, whatever prior agreement or connection he had with the ruling party of Versia was now cut off. He had half-hoped that the choice would remain open, but he soon snapped out of it, reminding himself that there were always other opportunities to hunt for. <em>Versia can wait – I have districts to control.</em></p><p>He made his way to the factory, convening with the designers on the final prototype of the knight armor suit. There were twelve copies, sufficient for the demonstration. For the purposes of testing, a few experienced associates and cobras were already there, donning the prototypes.</p><p>The armor was far lighter than the original steel armor set that the Raktor knights were using, though it was thicker by about a third while boasting an improved penetration resistance. The honeycomb-like structure was neatly hidden away, the metallic surface of the plates yet to be painted in the Baron's noble colors.</p><p>Kyle originally had the concept of engraving the interior of each of the honeycombs, only to realize that was far beyond the capabilities of the factory to mass produce. If the demonstration is a success, the amount of orders will be in the tens of thousands. <em>Better to keep it simple for now.</em></p><p>Interestingly, the System recognized the entire armor suit as a single item, with the stat bonuses and skills combined.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Equipment</strong>: Aspis Mk1 Knight Armor (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A mass-produced armor set by the Aspis Weapons Factory in Raktor</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 15 MP, <strong>Duration</strong>: 2 minutes, <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 minutes.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle was surprised to see the skills being able to be combined like this into a single skill, and it seemed to perform more efficiently than if they were separated. He wondered if he could eventually combine all the engravings that he had learned over the last year into a compound engraving. <em>Maybe next time.</em></p><p>For now, he watched as the testers perform basic mobility tests, running up and down in a makeshift obstacle course, as well as testing the flexibility of the limbs. Team B had focused heavily on the freedom of movement, leaving a few gaps between the armor that could be exploited, but the point defense engraving helped to mitigate the number of potential threats, save for a close-range attack.</p><p>A few mock battles ensued over the day, before Kyle was finally convinced that they had a working product, ready for the demonstration. &quot;Have all the suits cleaned up and prepare them for shipment to Baron Cain. Each team's designer will follow me to the demonstration event. Keep an eye out for our competitors - I want a list of potential improvements to be compiled on our return.&quot;</p><p>@@@</p><p>The center of the private proving grounds was filled to the brim with weapons and armor manufacturers from all over the town, the bulk of them in the pocket of Count Leon. Esteemed arctech designers and weapons masters mingled and discussed their latest innovations with each other, though keeping their inner workings close their chest, exchanging frivolous pleasantries.</p><p>At the foyer of the private arena was a battalion of Raktor Knights under Count Leon, mobilized to ensure no Versian was able to sneak in. The scar of the Ilysian Punks stealing military secrets still weighed heavily over the city, and only served as a mocking point for other foreign Barons from Kregol and Perlis who came to visit, chaffing at the strict security.</p><p>While the craftsman socialized in the center, on a higher floor of the arena, Baron Cain reclined on a viewing couch, munching on a vine of fresh ripe grapes served by two servants who stood at his beck and call. He was not alone in the VIP viewing gallery, with the other lesser lords of the city and priests of the Sanctum of Yual speaking in soft tones with each other, hashing out deals.</p><p>&quot;Baron Cain.&quot; A white-robed lady with the insignia of the Sanctum bowed in respect upon approaching his couch, escorted by an inquisitor.</p><p>&quot;Bishop Vernette. Inquisitor Mason.&quot; Baron Cain nodded, motioning for them to have a seat next to him. &quot;I hear that your finances have been suffering.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed it has. The violence has been spilling out over from the West Sector in waves, with almost all of our resources dedicated to stemming the tide of crime.&quot; Despite the seemingly large control of the South Sector by the Ardent Cretins, there were still nine districts that were firmly in the Bishop's hand, with no one gang claiming control over them, not even Sebastian.</p><p>&quot;Is that so...? From my perspective, it seems that you are hiding something else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you are referring to the pull back of enforcers from the Seven Snakes district, need I remind you that we have also pulled our enforcers from the Red Lions and the Wretches's zones of control as well. We only have so many men at our beck and call, and their lives are of the utmost importance to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;More than enforcing the Sanctum's law? I fund half of your current budget.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the other half is funded by me.&quot; A stranger interrupted the conversation, prompting the Baron to turn around.</p><p>&quot;Bishop Flectus. How nice of you to join in my private conversation. Perhaps you could provide a more reasonable explanation as to why the enforcers are not doing their jobs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are doing exactly what they should be doing - not cooperating with the vile gangs, unlike a few individuals here.&quot; Bishop Flectus sneered in response, his white-robed arms crossed in an elegant manner. &quot;The Sanctum of Yual should not tolerate those who run afoul of the holy commandments. Those who listen are inherently worth more than others.&quot;</p><p>Baron Cain did not reply, merely nodding nonchalantly, knowing that it was just an excuse. Bishop Flectus smiled and began to approach him, intending to sit on the same viewing couch only for the Baron's servants to block his path. &quot;Who are you two to stop me? I am a Bishop of the Central Sector!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I am a Baron and they are my loyal servants, not some bragging dog who doesn't know where to sit. Know your place and leave us.&quot; Baron Cain waved his hand dismissively, no longer paying attention to the simmering Bishop.</p><p>&quot;Now, now, now, that is no way to treat each other! We are all working for the same common goal here!&quot; A boisterous voice echoed from afar, Baron Cain knowing exactly who the owner of the voice was.</p><p>Immediately the entirety of the viewing gallery paused what they were doing, bowing towards Count Leon who were now entering with his appointed generals, five of whom flanked him from behind in an entourage. Count Leon bore a wide grin, unnervingly ecstatic as he reached out to Bishop Flectus, slinging his arms around his shoulder and patting playfully. &quot;Two arms of the same driven purpose - to make Raktor the city of dreams! No need for such abrupt confrontation! Let us all be a better man and put aside our disputes for today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As you wish, Count Leon.&quot; Bishop Flectus bowed again, shooting a scathing glare at Baron Cain as he was heralded by Count Leon away to another section of the viewing gallery, far from prying eyes and ears. Baron Cain scoffed at the arrogant display, turning to warn Bishop Vernette: &quot;I know what you're doing - you're trying to play both sides. Neither Kyle nor I will forget this betrayal.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you really call it a betrayal when I have not intervened at all? As a Bishop, I do what I must to protect my people.&quot; Bishop Vernette hardly wavered from the accusation. &quot;The inner politics are not the concern of the Sanctum of Yual.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So be it. Those who sit on the fence will eventually be ruptured from within, or brought to heel.&quot; Baron Cain did not press the issue any longer, his attention now drawn to the center of the private arena below him that was now clearing out, preparing for the demonstration of arms. A few servants issued pamphlets containing the agenda for the day's proceedings, the Baron noting that the requisite testing of arms was much more stringent and rigorous than ever before.</p><p>A lord who owned a weapon crafting workshop seemed to share the same sentiment, exclaiming out loud with shock to his peers. &quot;The criteria is too harsh - no armor suit nor weapon can survive such a beating!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps it is only yours that is unable to survive. Your armor is not known for its tenacity, after all. It is right to be worried.&quot; A taunt came from elsewhere, causing the surrounding lords to chuckle at the expense of the enraged lord.</p><p>&quot;Who slanders me in broad daylight? Show yourself if you dare!&quot; The furious lord stormed towards the source of the voice, only to instantly backpedal and hurriedly bow in return the moment he recognized the source.</p><p>&quot;Here I am. I am the one who slandered you. Now what would you have me do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My apologies, Baron Namor! I did not know it was you!&quot; The lord apologized frantically, half-expecting a punishment for acting so outwardly towards a Baron of all people.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Baron Namor shrugged it off, treating the slight as a non-issue. &quot;If you would like to not receive such taunts in the future, consider improving the quality of your products. Look how unbothered the others are, full of confidence in themselves to clear the bar set by the Count. War and technology are ever-developing, and one must strive to stay ahead of the curve and not rest on one's titles. I myself have the utmost assurance in the durability of my East Sector's offerings, and so do the other Barons. Isn't that right, Baron Cain?&quot;</p><p>Baron Cain could feel the underlying tones. &quot;Of course, Baron Namor. We do our best to strive for the betterment of our armed forces.&quot; Despite his outward confidence, the list of tests detailed in the pamphlet shocked him. He had only seen a few simple tests at the Aspis Weapons Factory and was unsure if Kyle's armor set and rifle would be up to the task. The clear confidence from the East Sector's Baron Namor alarmed him slightly.</p><p><em>Endurance, Durability and Penetration will be tested to the brink.</em> Baron Cain glanced around at the murmuring lords as well as the other Barons, flipping the pamphlet pages over. Only a total of twelve corporations had registered to vie for the demonstration - three coming from the Barons of Raktor, one from the county of Kregol and Perlis each, and seven owned by other lords and businessmen who had close ties with the Count.</p><p>On the other side of the viewing gallery, the members of the registered corporations were gathered, splitting the 'common folk' away from the nobility. Despite the overtly friendly atmosphere shared by the craftsman, each of them clearly recognized the other as rivals. It was especially apparent in the distinction between Sectors, Kyle being the only corporation from the South Sector applying for the demonstration.</p><p>Kyle flipped the pamphlet over, his brows furrowing at the various tests placed. It was far different from what Baron Cain had informed him, but thanks to his prior preparations, he was more than confident that the tests would pose no issue at all. The only factor that he could not control was the competency of Baron Cain's knights, who would be the ones donning the Aspis MK1 armor for the mock battle, assuming his armor survived the tests.</p><p><em>With Baron Cain in full sight of the tests, I doubt that anyone would try to cheat openly.</em> Kyle was certain that instead of cheating on the tests, the corporations affiliated with Count Leon had already known about these tests beforehand, allowing them to tailor the perfect armor to meet the criteria. It was certainly an effective way to filter out those who were underprepared.</p><p>Next to him on the viewing couch, Gordon and Buron sat down, both of them clearly excited about the upcoming tests. If it were not for the presence of Kyle, they may have spilled the beans about their innovations and progress with the armor to anyone who might ask, constituting an information leak of sorts.</p><p>Buron almost left his seat, unable to control the urge to speak to one of the other craftsman that he had been eavesdropping on, only for a firm hand to hold him down. He looked up to see a stern Sasha, as silent as ever, her glare treating Buron like a rebellious kid that could be killed at the drop of the hat. Whatever thoughts he had of running off and interacting with other designers faded away in an instant.</p><p>Kyle had Sasha return from the Culdao Peaks to bolster security in the district. After all, the unrest was occurring in the city, not in the goblin kingdom, where Merissa, Feldon, Gulak and King Sahusa had everything under control. Sasha herself drew a few quick glances from others around the viewing gallery, most of them never having seen her before in the Seven Snakes.</p><p>&quot;Ah, Mr. Kyle. I am surprised to see you here of all places. Don't you have a riot to control?&quot; A taunt wafted in from the side.</p><p>Kyle glanced sideways, only to break out into a smile. &quot;Why, if it isn't Master Foolish, Dull and Witless together as a trio. If I hadn't seen one of you lurking outside the erotic shops of Thresher Street, I would have thought all of you were conjoined at the waist from birth.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My name is -&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hardly care what your name is. Perhaps you should keep such unwanted information to yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You fucking brat, you don't know who you're messing with! Sooner or later, the riot will grow beyond your control.&quot;</p><p>Kyle raised his eyebrows. &quot;Careful, Master Witless. Such predictions would lead some to believe that you might be the culprits behind the unrest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths firmly rejects and denounces the brutal execution of the family by unknown men. That is, if the Baron's announcement is to be believed in the first place.&quot; Master Witless smirked.</p><p>&quot;I will be sure to let the Baron of the South Sector know that there are men who do not believe a noble's words.&quot; Kyle waved his hand dismissively, leaving the three masters stunned and furious. Master Witless tried to step forward but was summarily blocked by a fearsome Sasha, who glared at them.</p><p>&quot;Those scrooges are persistent, they might be behind the rioting and execution,&quot; Gordon whispered to Kyle. &quot;We should have them investigated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. But for now, worry about what's in front of us than about theories. I'll handle them.&quot;</p><p>From the corner of Kyle's eyes, he could spot the East Sector's corporations congregating together in a corner of the gallery. In the midst of them was a heavily tattooed man wearing nothing but a sleeveless shirt and shorts. It was a Tul'e Da'li ranking officer, a member of the East Sector’s major gang, who sneered back at Kyle. &quot;A minor gang from the South Sector trying to swim in the big leagues. How ridiculous! Sebastian must be losing his touch.&quot;</p><p>Kyle ignored the obvious taunt, his focus on the arena that was now setting up for the first test, though the officer was not about to let up.</p><p>&quot;Look at him, thinking he's the cock of the town with his shiny fake gold cloak. That suit looks like it came off a slum dweller, hah!&quot; The Tul'e Da'li ranking officer continued from afar, drawing the laughter of the associates that gathered around him. &quot;Acting like some bigshot, tough guy. He’s just a bag of hot air. Probably sucked some dicks to get here in the first place!&quot;</p><p>Sasha nearly started, her hands about to draw a blade strapped to her body when Kyle held up his hand, ordering her to stop. &quot;Actions speak louder than words. We do not need more enemies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yea, that's right. Keep your bitch reigned in like a good little dog. You're lucky we ain't in the South, because we would have decimated you! HAHAHA!&quot;</p><p>Kyle brushed off the never-ending series of taunts, unwilling to fight. There was no reason to start a ruckus, especially when he had a military contract to win. Beating up the Tul'e Da'li officer was simple enough, it was the consequences that made it untenable. It was already painful enough to deal with the Ardent Cretins - getting onto another major gang's hit list was not something Kyle wanted now.</p><p>[We shall now begin the demonstration test! Participants will now undergo tests under various scenarios - failing the tests at any stage means you shall not be moving on! Only a complete knight armor set with a rifle will be accepted as the product to be tested!] An announcer called out through the arctech speakers, his voice booming through the small enclosed private arena. Apart from the two viewing galleries, the normal seats were filled up with other journeymen and masters from the Weapon's Guild of Raktor, each of them looking for inspiration or the latest technology development in Raktor.</p><p>&quot;Bet the runt won't even make it past the first stage, hah!&quot; The Tul'e Da'li continued mocking Kyle incessantly, causing a vein to pulse on Kyle's temples.</p><p>Not wanting a fight did not mean Kyle was about to let him go off scot-free. He twirled a small vial of Absolute Euria into Sasha's hand discreetly, his Designate Follower skill activating. [Make sure you're not seen.]</p><p>[Understood. Full dose?]</p><p>[Half dose. I'm a generous man - he can repent for the rest of his life. If he survives.]</p><p><strong>
