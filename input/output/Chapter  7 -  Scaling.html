<p>Chapter  7: Scaling</h1></p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>Slavin was gushing over how much money had been made since the introduction of the Stamina Potions. “It’s working like a charm. How are you getting all of these potions?”</p><p>“A new trade secret of the Seven Snakes,” Kyle replied nonchalantly as he tallied the earnings.</p><p>A tidy sum of eight thousand rakels over seven days was a significant boost to their revenue stream. Assuming nothing wrong happened, they were set to make more than forty thousand rakels from this brothel alone every month.</p><p>With the potions, the number of repeat customers had increased, along with word of the brothel spreading. Rumors of the vigorous intensity of the sex workers went viral through the district, prompting even more people to visit them.</p><p>Kyle still had plans to scale this further. “Read this.” He passed a rolled-up parchment over to Slavin, who glanced through it, shock becoming more and more evident on his face as he read.</p><p>“Impressive. Loyalty programs and points will surely make even more customers come in multiple times, especially when you lock the Stamina Potion behind the program,” Slavin remarked with a surprised look, wondering how the young man had so many ideas. The idea was not -unique, but Slavin had never thought of applying it to a brothel, of all things.</p><p>Kyle nodded in response, moving on to the next subject. “With the stamina potions available for your workers, you could have more of them coming in.”</p><p>“Yes, the size of the brothel isn’t enough to accommodate all of them. Even if they were willing to work today, I wouldn’t have a room for them…” Slavin sighed.</p><p>“How much to expand to the next floor?”</p><p>“It won’t cost much—about two thousand rakels a month in rent for the next floor. We’d still have to do a fair amount of work, though—the place was a complete trash pile the last time I saw it. We’ll need movers to clear the floor before I get the construction crew in.”</p><p>“If I get you your movers, how long will it take to construct?”</p><p>“Hmm… a week at most. The cost will be about six thousand rakels if I remember correctly. I’ll have to check with Reyas again.”</p><p>“Approved. Get it done as soon as possible.”</p><p>Returning to the Seven Snakes’ base, Kyle rallied all of the associates, pausing the production of potions as well as the training that had been ongoing for two weeks now. Kyle could already see slight improvements in the physiques of nearly all of his men. Though this was only the beginning of the training, Damian was also shaping up to be much fitter than he was before.</p><p>Kyle glanced at Keith, who was standing at attention. “Have you been training as well?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, though not to such an extent due to my additional duties.”</p><p>Kyle inspected Keith’s body, noticing there was almost no difference between two weeks ago and now. He said nothing, but Keith could already read volumes from his disappointed gaze. Keith had always been one of the weakest in the gang, only kept around because of his prior scholar education as well as being Damian’s younger brother.</p><p>Kyle expected every member to be strong—even his accountants. However, if this was the result of two weeks, Kyle was not expecting any significant improvements on Keith’s part anytime soon.</p><p>“Training will be put on temporary hold. Instead, we will clean out the floor above the brothel to make space for expansion,” Kyle explained.</p><p>“You mean the Lusty Arcian?” Damian’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>“Yes.” Kyle still barely remembered the name of the brothel. It mattered little to him, how much money he could make was the only relevant piece of information. Everything was about economies of scale.</p><p>The associates got ready, moving over to the new floor above the brothel with Damian in the lead. Thanks to Slavin’s connection to the building owner, they immediately got access.</p><p>Damian entered the floor, almost recoiling at the stench. It was clear that a few squatters used to live here, with their refuse and junk all over the place.</p><p>“Be quick! The faster we move, the more money we’ll make! Don’t you want to be rich?!” Damian ordered, issuing tasks and focusing on what to clear first. The doorway was narrow, so some of the more significant trash that had somehow fused together in a burnt slag pile had to be broken apart.</p><p>Over the loud clanging of metal, Damian was overseeing the cleanup diligently, helping out wherever an extra hand was needed. Suddenly, he felt a cold shiver run down his spine as a soothing voice spoke close to his ear, its breath tickling his skin. “Damian, dear, you’ve grown up so fast.”</p><p>Damian immediately launched his elbow at whoever was behind him, only to be stopped by Slavin, who grinned widely. “You used to be such a cute, naïve boy. Now, look at you—underboss of the Seven Snakes.”</p><p>A bright red blush began to appear on Damian’s ears. “That was five years ago. Stop teasing me!”</p><p>“Do you remember when you first came to the brothel a pure soul? Oh, the screams of joy I heard from your room that night…”</p><p>Damian’s face flushed, with a wave of snickering breaking out amongst the others who were clearly listening in. “That was only the first time, all right?”</p><p>“Sure, darling. Oh, look here. What a cutie you are!” Slavin walked up to another associate, grabbing his chin and viewing him from all angles. The associate desperately tried to break free, pulling his head away. However, the grip was rock solid, and his struggles only elicited a smirk from Slavin.</p><p>“You seem to be a new face, and you have great looks. I think you could be the flagship worker for the Lusty Arcian! How about you come work for me? Kyle doesn’t seem to appreciate your talents. You’ll be treated much better here. Customers would love you! And don’t worry; I won’t take all the profits. You’ll get a nice cut.”</p><p><em>Fucking hell, am I getting scouted? </em>While the associate was slightly happy at being praised for his looks, the thought of being a sex worker did not appeal to him. “I-I-I think I’m good,” the associate said with squished cheeks as Slavin let him go.</p><p>The brothel owner frowned slightly. “A pity. Oh? How about you?” His eyes lit up again, locking onto another target to add to his employees.</p><p>The associates worked as fast as they could, spurred on by the harassment of Slavin’s employment advances. Within a single day, the floor was cleared and spotless, allowing the construction crew to begin work on the expansion.</p><p>Kyle remained in his office, calculating the total profit. The bulk purchase of ingredients and flasks made the potions exceedingly cheap. It only cost about twenty-seven rakels per potion at current market rates, which meant that even if he sold them for half the price of what Haui had charged, his profit margin would be tenfold.</p><p>He could sell them for way lower at a profit margin of twofold, but that would draw unwarranted attention and bring him into direct conflict with Haui and perhaps the Alchemists’ Guild. <em>I’m still laying the foundations for my own cartel. We’ll have to play it slow for a while; moving too fast can backfire and deteriorate my standing rapidly.</em></p><p>Instead of selling the potions outright, they were only provided to brothel clientele. Repeat customers could purchase them through the loyalty program, with quantity limited by the number of times they visited.  This ensured that the number of possible leaks will be controlled at the start, allowing him to carefully build up his supply chain with minimal interruptions.</p><p>Kyle glanced at the office table, noting the district map with the gangs’ territories marked out. <em>The Red Lions are our closest neighbor. Hmm…</em></p><p>Kyle called Damian into his office. “It’s been more than two weeks since I took over. I think it is about time.”</p><p>“Time for what?”</p><p>“Expect a few small skirmishes with the Red Lions soon. With the roaring success and rumors of our brothel, it would be surprising to see them take no action at all. Post two associates on rotation to watch for any movements or advances. Should any issues arise, report back to me immediately. Do <em>not </em>fight without me.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Night soon came around again, and this time, the brothel’s queue of customers extended all the way into the alley, with dozens of regulars willing to wait half an hour to get their fix. No one in the queue talked with one another; they were far too focused on getting to the counter.</p><p>Niko was present, having waited about fifteen minutes. His leg continuously shifted as he rubbed his hands, a slight jitter visible in his eyes, which darted around. He scratched his neck feverishly, feeling that constant numb feeling that permeated his jawline and gums as he continuously slackened his jaw.</p><p> He soon made it to the front, meeting Slavin for the second time. “Oh, Niko! Back so soon?”</p><p>Niko scratched the back of his neck and laughed nervously. “Yeah. Haha… Is Ellie around? I would like to have her again—if possible.”</p><p>“Sorry, dear. She’s currently occupied. If you don’t mind waiting a little longer, she’ll be available in… maybe an hour?”</p><p>“That’s fine. I can wait…” Niko’s eyes darted to the Stamina Potions on display behind the counter.</p><p>Slavin caught on, a grin appearing on his face. “The first two were on the house since you were a newcomer. You’ll have to buy the potions through the loyalty program now.” He proceeded to explain the loyalty program.</p><p>Niko instinctively got it—the more one visited, the more they could buy. “This is my second visit, right? So, I can only buy one, right?”</p><p>“Yes, you can. It’s three hundred rakels. Want one?”</p><p>The price was high, but less extravagant than some of the other alchemist shops in other districts. Niko had done his research, and he knew that buying the potion right now would tank his savings tremendously. However, his first time in the brothel was nothing short of a life-changing experience. Slavin could even visibly see Niko begin to radiate more confidence.</p><p>Niko was about to hand over the money when a large commotion broke out at the brothel entrance. An expression of annoyance and anger replaced Slavin’s grin. “Sorry, Niko. I have some ruffians to deal with.” He cracked his knuckles, grabbed a bat from behind the counter, and headed outside.</p><p>Curious about what was unfolding, Niko returned to the stairwell, only noticing that the alleyway had been blocked by more than a dozen men wearing red armbands with the crest of a roaring lion on them. They were split into two groups, covering both ends of the alley.</p><p>“Been hearing all about your good business, pimp!” The captain of the Red Lion’s crew spat on the ground, fiddling with a hammer that had neon red arctech engraving along the head and handle. He was the only one wearing some kind of arctech-infused armor; the rest had basic metal pipes and sticks.</p><p>“It’d be a real shame if some hooligans were to break down and scare away your loyal customers. Perhaps you need protection from someone strong, like me. Name’s Lionel.” A sinister smirk erupted on his face while he performed a mocking bow.</p><p>Niko noticed the queue had thinned. Most of the customers had fled in fear of getting beaten up. Though that was a kink for some, they still preferred to be conscious when it happened. Those who remained were hoping to be compensated with free potions for the inconvenience brought about by the hooligans parading through the alley.</p><p>He contemplated leaving, but it was already too late—he and a few other customers were trapped inside, with Slavin protecting them. Niko felt useless, weak, and incompetent in the face of the Red Lions. <em>What the fuck have I been doing with my life? Working in a dumb factory all day, only to get caught in a fight with no real skills to defend myself with.</em></p><p>“Indeed, a real shame. However, we’re already protected and covered under the Seven Snakes. My apologies, <em>Lionel,</em>” Slavin said eloquently with a tinge of sarcasm, crossing his arms. He was at least a head taller than most of the gang members, but he didn’t intimidate them in the slightest.</p><p>“Seven Snakes? That old, fat pig, Ulon? Bah, he hasn’t left his den in years! Looks like you need a lesson on who calls the shots ‘round here,” Lionel scoffed.</p><p>Slavin remained stoic as their staredown continued. However, deep down, he knew he could not fend off this many fighters from raiding the brothel. <em>The customers will need to escape through one of the other side entrances, but it’ll be far too cramped. </em>His eyes glanced at Niko, who was already trembling as he cowered in the stairwell.</p><p>Before Lionel could order a raid on the establishment, a cry of pain erupted from the Red Lions opposite him. A chaos erupted among the six members, who were seemingly fighting something.</p><p>“Haha! Which idiot decided to interfere?!” Lionel smirked, knowing that his Red Lions members wouldn’t lose to a street thug. Most likely, it was a drunk customer trying to defend the club.</p><p>Any moment now, he would expect to see the beaten-up body of a no-name. Instead, he saw a dismembered limb with the Red Lions armband sail through the air toward him, landing at his feet with a bloody thud. Shock rippled through the Red Lions, but Slavin remained unphased—he knew who was on the other side of the attack.</p><p>“It seems you’re about to receive a lesson yourself.” Slavin grinned, rolling up his sleeves.<h1><a id="_gyjl4ldjnn1l"></a>
