<p>Chapter  14: Horizontal Merger</h1></p><p>“Sir, how did you know they weren’t going to call in reinforcements? It seems stupid not to do so, seeing as they lost half a squad.” Damian was confused as he oversaw the associates dragging captured Red Lions members to their holding cells.</p><p>“Wrent is a showman through and through. Any action that could potentially damage his reputation wouldn’t be taken. Even then, us providing Strength Potions to many of the other smaller gangs around them has increased the number of issues their main base has to deal with, which means they can spare even fewer men to counter us,” Kyle explained. </p><p>“Then why didn’t we chase them down and defeat them in one single blow? Now they’ll have time to recover and retaliate in a few days.”</p><p>“A cornered star fleet is just as dangerous as a wounded one.”</p><p>“Fleet? As in naval battles?”</p><p>“Never mind. Either way, pushing them too hard would attract more attention from the major bases. The victory over them must be complete but not too flashy.” </p><p>Damian finally understood Kyle’s line of thinking. It wasn’t right to go all out and stomp the opposition in a domineering fashion, especially when the foundations of the gang weren’t solid enough. There were too many big fish in the district watching right now. Having the Seven Snakes come to a draw or a very minor victory was less alarming. </p><p>The two of them began checking on the injured members, with Kyle healing them with his Necklace of Healing. The Red Lions were still dominant when it came to weaponry, causing some of the Seven Snakes members to fall unconscious after fighting enemy squad leaders fitted with arctech equipment. A few even had mangled or severely bruised limbs. <em>I should reverse-engineer a Health Potion after this.</em></p><p>He soon returned to his office, tired from the intense running he had had to do. The plan had been executed perfectly, though he might have been slightly forced to buy the Aero Shoes from the dealer to move faster. With this, the chances of the Red Lions attacking them would be much lower than expected; they were now even in numbers.</p><p>Kyle was well aware that the Red Lions still had the edge in terms of equipment, as evidenced by the damage inflicted on his gang members. Nevertheless, he wasn’t worried at all. <em>In a few days, they will crumble, and it‘ll be an easy negotiation…</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>Five days after the assault…</em></p><p>Wrent woke up groggy, his forehead sweating buckets as he struggled to get up from his bed. <em>Fuck. Have I been infected with a plague or something?</em> He could feel his heart rate increasing, and there was a general sinking feeling in his stomach. </p><p>The nerves on his jaw and spine were especially tender, as though he could feel every millimeter of his gums going numb, causing him to try to dislodge the feeling constantly. </p><p>The other Red Lions members were not faring any better either; some were puking or reporting intense nausea. “What in the world is going on?” Wrent muttered as he watched the members stumble about, lacking strength. “Hey, you. Weren’t you supposed to be on patrol? What if the Seven Snakes attack?”</p><p>“H-Huh?” The Red Lions member could barely register what Wrent was saying, obviously hallucinating.</p><p><em>Fucking shit. What is happening?!</em> Wrent tried to recall what had happened. <em>Did Kyle somehow infect the base’s utilities? How is this happening to us?</em></p><p>Wrent had been taking antidotes for the last two days, which had barely managed to stave off the symptoms. He had even tried a precious Health Potion, but it didn’t work at all. <em>It isn’t poison… So what is it?</em></p><p>His eyes landed on the broken crates of Stamina Potions, a sense of understanding finally hitting him. <em>Did they drug the potions? How in the world is it so addictive?! But I tested it!</em></p><p>Addiction was not a particularly new symptom, but he had not seen anything on the black market that came even remotely close to the level of addiction and mass production as this.</p><p>The strategy employed by the Seven Snakes was finally as clear as day. Before Wrent could think about doing anything, a loud bang at the base entrance was heard.</p><p>It was the Seven Snakes.</p><p>Kyle walked in, dressed in a clean, formal suit, unlike the arctech equipment he had worn previously. Damian and Keith flanked him, along with a dozen other members.</p><p>“You dare come to your own death? Red Lions, attack him!” Wrent grunted weakly. Instead of complying, the members merely staggered about, and some others suffered from mild seizures.</p><p>Kyle snapped his fingers, with the Seven Snakes moving forward to restrain the barely  resisting Red Lions. The most they could muster was an infantile resistance.</p><p>“Useless!” Wrent grunted as he grabbed his sword with his right hand, about to unleash another red arc with a swing. But in a single instant, Kyle sprinted toward him with the Aero Shoes, closing the distance in merely four strides before gripping the right hand of Wrent and forcing it down. </p><p>“ARGHH!” Wrent yelled in pain as Kyle crushed his right hand with the hilt of the sword. He tried to muster the strength to fight back, but the withdrawal symptoms made it impossible. Wrent could feel that his muscles were severely weakened.</p><p>“This is no way to treat your esteemed suppliers, is it?” Kyle flashed a sinister grin.</p><p>At this point, Wrent heavily regretted not asking for help from the main base, realizing he had fully underestimated Kyle. He had become too used to the image of the Seven Snakes being useless under Ulon.</p><p>“Do it then. Kill me,” Wrent said through gritted teeth as he was brought to one knee, forced to look up at Kyle. “The leader of the Red Lions will never let you off.”</p><p>“Ah. Why would I ever kill my precious customers? Please, no need for such courtesy. You can stop kneeling.” Kyle let go of his hand, and Damian moved forward to lift Wrent up. </p><p>They dragged him into the office, sitting him down at a table facing. Kyle retrieved a parchment from a message tube and slid it in front of Wrent for him to read. “I believe the samples we provided in the previous contract were much to your liking. In fact, it seems your members love it so much they’re even dying for it.”</p><p>“Y-You!” Wrent cursed as sweat dripped down his forehead. He could barely move his body now, and the bones in his right hand had been fractured by Kyle’s grip. </p><p>“Now for our next contract, we would like to enter a mutually beneficial supply contract. If you sign this, we will immediately provide a few crates in advance for your perusal.  How does that sound?” Kyle motioned outside the office window, where Wrent could see two additional Seven Snakes members carrying crates.</p><p>He could already see the hunger in his members’ eyes as they watched the crates come in. They weren’t dumb, knowing they were addicted to the potions now, but they didn’t have the willpower to fight their bodies. </p><p>Wrent took another look at Kyle, who was patiently sitting with Damian and Keith standing behind him. While Kyle’s expression was calm and serene, Wrent knew there was a cruelness hiding within. <em>What’s more important—my loyalty to the boss or my life?</em> </p><p>He glanced at his members suffering outside. Wrent grimaced and finally decided to look at the contract, rationalizing to himself that he was doing it for his subordinates. He began reading through it, noticing the clauses were roughly the same except for the fact that he now had to pay for the potions.</p><p>He read the changes to the non-aggression clause, noticing the contract had extended it to a year minimum. This was expected, but the next clause was what threw him off.</p><p>It stated that the Seven Snakes would <em>publicly</em><strong><em> </em></strong>admit that the conflict had been their fault and their loss. They would then pay reparations in the form of potion discounts and the release of prisoners.</p><p>Wrent was utterly confused, but as he looked up into Kyle’s eyes, a realization rose within him. <em>He’s leaving me a way out—a way not to be replaced by my boss. And if I or our side in general renege on the reparation contract, our reputation will go straight into the gutter. </em></p><p>With this additional clause, the Red Lions would not suffer any reputation loss, and the Seven Snakes would also have their non-aggression pact. Wrent would have a much higher chance of retaining his position and control over the district, which was precisely what Kyle wanted. In his mind, Wrent vowed to kill Kyle in any way possible. <em>This man is far too dangerous. At this rate, he’ll take over the entire sector within two years.</em></p><p>Wrent eventually relented and signed the contract with his personal stamp. “Good. I’m glad we’ve come to an agreement. Enjoy the potions. We look forward to your future cooperation.” Kyle smirked and left immediately. While the contract was between equals, Wrent knew he had become the underling in the unspoken hierarchy, gripping his fist tightly.</p><p>As the Seven Snakes released the restrained members and left the new crates behind, the members were confused about what had just happened. Some of the members were certain they were going to be killed.</p><p>Wrent didn’t know what to tell them. All they could do now was consume the potions. <em>I swear I’ll find a way to remove this addiction and take revenge!</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>Always leave a way out for a cornered corvette, lest they choose to self-destruct. It is better to milk your enemies. </em>Kyle was happy with the result. While he would be losing the prisoners, he had run sufficient tests on the addiction properties by now. With the gang members being trained for over a month, there was no need for addiction-ridden prisoners to fight against. They could simply spar against one another.</p><p><em>This will also prevent the more significant gangs from clamping down on us. Anyone else that tries to attack us will risk angering the Red Lions, seeing as we are supplying them in a reparation contract…</em></p><p>None of the Seven Snakes were unhappy with the outcome, even though it was to be publicly declared; they all knew they had emerged as victors of the conflict. It boosted their pride and sense of accomplishment, but most of all, it caused their respect for Kyle to soar far into the clouds. All the members were comparing him to Ulon, though it was a low bar to clear. Even the new recruits who hadn’t fought as much were starstruck by how easily they defeated the Red Lions.</p><p>“Holy shit! It was only a few hours of skirmishes, four days of patrols, and that’s it? Is our leader some sort of monster?”</p><p>“He managed to sneak into their base alone and escape even with Wrent defending! How awesome is that? Fuck the guy who told me Wrent was a beast!” Niko excitedly whispered as they watched Kyle return to the base with the rest.</p><p>Kyle began giving out orders. “Keith, prepare the public announcement. Spread it through our businesses. Get Slavin in on it as well.” The brothel expansion was going well despite the conflict, with the customers reasonably assured of the protection provided by the Seven Snakes. </p><p>“Damian, arrange for the prisoner transfer process. Return everyone, addicted or not.”</p><p>“Everyone else, gather in the common area in three hours for dinner. It’s time to celebrate.” A loud cheer erupted among the associates. They were excited to celebrate their first victory in over five years.</p><p>Kyle returned to his office, looking at the map that showed the districts again. </p><p><em>The base is now secured against most smaller threats. The locals are now well aware of the resurgence of the Seven Snakes.</em> Kyle nodded to himself, but he knew he was far from being a significant power in the city of Raktor. If he truly wanted to achieve his first original objective of building a solid power base, only when he had dominated an entire city would he consider it as some measure of success. </p><p>His eyes fell on the list of gangs in the South Sector, noting the prominent individuals and the top dominator—the Ardent Cretins. Despite the daunting challenges ahead, Kyle already had a step-by-step plan for what to do.</p><p><em>I used to rule nebulas, spice routes, and star systems with populations numbering in the trillions. What’s a small city like this to me?</em><h1><a id="_z5a0ukowb6wa"></a>
