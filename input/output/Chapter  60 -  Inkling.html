<p>Chapter  60: Inkling</p><p><em>Deep underground in an unknown location of Versia…</em></p><p>The sound of panting and grunting filled the wide cavern, with the flashes of metal striking metal glinting through the darkness, illuminating the shadows thrown by the arctech lamps situated all over the ceiling.</p><p>A dozen rock spiders circled and scaled the walls, their red, beady gem-like eyes glinting at the man who was currently being assaulted by three of their brethren. The man heaved as he brandished a sword in each hand, duel-wielding and spinning while he parried each of their strikes.</p><p>The man did not have enough hands to parry, with one spider breaking through and launching a stabbing attack with two of its pointed legs.</p><p>His eyes glowed lightning-blue, with a surge of lightning arcing like a power line down his skin, accelerating his motions to levels impossible. Within a split second, he had accurately stabbed his sword into the red, beady eyes of each of the three spiders.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Rock Spider”</p><p></p><p>The rock spiders collapsed with a shriek, their bodies going limp as the man kicked them to the side, his legs bloodied and stained with slimy, dried dirt hardened between his joints. He wiped the sweat off his grimy forehead, grinning to himself as he watched three of the other dozen spiders begin to saunter down toward him, taking the place of their fallen brethren.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Failed</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">You did not manage to kill a dozen spiders within the aforementioned time limit of three minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The trial has been reset.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The man did not pay any attention to the holographic message in front of him, simply swiping it away as he prepared himself for the new round of enemies. The level of skill that he displayed was more than enough to clear the trial with ease, yet for some reason, the man was still stuck here, slowing himself down on purpose.</p><p>A voice called out from the edge of the cavern, showing a servant dressed like an explorer. “Sir Soren, your breakfast is ready.” In front of him were two metal tins filled with what looked like baked beans and a slab of kaya butter on white bread.</p><p>“Almost finished!” the man said through his gritted teeth as he blocked a stab from the spider, parrying it with his lightning-infused sword. Although he had cut the spider’s leg off, he did not finish it. “I forfeit the trial!”</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Forfeited</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Failure is the mother of success. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You may enter the trial again after three hours.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He let out a sigh as the spiders began to back off, retreating back into their holes in the cavern walls. One of them even scampered past the servant, completely avoiding him as it burrowed deep into the wall. “That was a good exercise. If I stay here for three months, I’ll catch up to my siblings in no time!”</p><p>“Sir Soren, need I remind you that the amount of EXP that you are receiving from these spiders will exponentially decay over time? This is not an efficient long-term leveling method. You need to—”</p><p>“Yes, yes, I know. Why are you nagging exactly in the same way as Mother? I’ve been changing dungeons, haven’t I?” Soren scratched his chin as he strutted over, plopping down onto the ground in a crude manner and grabbing the metal tin off the floor along with the kaya bread. “Mmm… Tastes like home. I’m sure glad you came along with me.”</p><p>“I did not have a choice, sir. You used your points to—”</p><p>“—to request your assistance instead of asking for a weapon or a specific posting. Yes, Rayner. I’ve heard the story before; I was there, remember?”</p><p>“And you will do well to remember that I will not help you with the next phase too.”</p><p>“But that can change as well, can it not?” Soren grinned, causing Rayner to sigh in exasperation.</p><p>They soon finished their breakfast, with Soren licking the leftover kaya off his thumb as he picked up his dual swords again. “Well then, round three it is! Statistics!” he declared, checking his stats once more. “Only a bit more to go to the next level.”</p><p>“Sir, the trial will not reset for another two hours. We should find another place first.”</p><p>“You’re right; we can easily clear up some of the mobs nearby.”</p><p>Soren and Rayner packed up their equipment, with Rayner hefting the backpack over while Soren whistled as they trekked down through a derelict hallway.</p><p>The walls were made of brick, covered in moss and algae, which thrived in the damp, moist areas illuminated by the arctech lanterns eternally turned on along the hallways. Countless skeletons lay along the floor, which they gingerly stepped over. A good majority of them were monster skeletons, but a few were distinctively human.</p><p>“Remnants from the Heavenly War, it seems.”</p><p>“Pah, useless old farts. If it weren’t for their incompetence, we would be masters of this world already,” Soren scoffed. “If I had been alive back then, I would have easily turned the tide with just a single blade.”</p><p>“It is good to have such confidence, but perhaps you should work on your foundation first?” Rayner insinuated.</p><p>Soren scowled at Rayner, ignoring him and continuing to walk down the hallway toward a location they had previously marked. The number of skeletons left behind began to decrease sharply as they approached the hallway, causing Rayner to stop Soren for a moment.</p><p>“Be careful. Even the elders of the clan are wary of entering such a place.”</p><p>“Then all the more for the great Soren to show them who’s better! I did not choose you to act like Mother, you know!” Soren berated Rayner, shrugging off the woman’s hand and storming off farther into the hallway.</p><p>They soon reached a large, throne-like room, except it was filled to the brim with rubble, except for the center pathway that was adorned with a stained red carpet, nearly blackened from the soot and dust accumulating over who knows how long.</p><p>On the throne sat a rock golem nearly the size of a small hill. It had four arms along with three crystal eyes embedded into each of its three heads.</p><p>The room shuddered as the rock golem began to shift slightly, the crystal eyes filling up with life as they shone emerald. The rubble around Soren began to form into humanoid shapes, albeit some with additional limbs and many featuring a tail. All of them were made of rocks, consolidating around a single core well protected by various layers of metal.</p><p>“Well then. Good luck, sir. I will see you for lunch.”</p><p>“Thanks, Rayner.” Soren grinned as he brandished his two swords. “All right, bring it on then!” </p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial of the Emperor</p>
