<p>Chapter  11: Addiction Symptoms</h1></p><p>The training routine went as planned. The main reason why Kyle wanted so many prisoners was due to the mental trauma inflicted on each prisoner after combat training. No prisoner could remain sane after being beaten up by twenty gang members in a row while continuously being healed. </p><p>“JUST LET ME DIE!” One of the Red Lions prisoners shook the coarse shoddyiron bars of his temporary jail violently. They were segregated into separate cages, ensuring they couldn’t help each other break out. </p><p>“Shut up, idiot. They can’t even hear you from inside this room,” Lionel grumbled. It had only been a day since they had been imprisoned, but a few of the members’ mental states were at an all-time low. </p><p>There was someone else in the room who clearly had it much worse, judging by the continuous groaning, the scratching of nails against rusted metal, and clattering of teeth. Lionel glanced over at Riker’s cage to see him lying on the floor in a cold sweat, shivering. </p><p>He wasn’t particularly surprised to see Riker here after they were captured. Kyle was that strong, after all, so he didn’t expect Riker to escape either.</p><p>“Fucking hell. What did they do to you? Potion overdose?” Lionel asked, but Riker barely registered the question, only turning and tossing about on the cold metal surface. </p><p>At this moment, the main door to the room opened, revealing Kyle flanked by Damian.</p><p>Immediately, the other Red Lions members started cursing and swearing at Kyle, blasting them with everything they had ever learned in their short lives within Raktor. Kyle simply raised an eyebrow at some of the more colorful expressions they had for him while Damian was lugging a sack of Stamina Potions, giving them one each. </p><p>Lionel grabbed a potion, still astonished at how many the Seven Snakes had. This was the third one they’d received since their imprisonment. Going by Haui’s price, it meant Kyle had spent more than 1,800 rakels on each prisoner. <em>Is this guy loaded or what?</em></p><p>He noticed Damian didn’t give Riker any Stamina Potions, but the moment Riker saw the potion in his hand, he turned into some sort of feral beast, lunging for it. The bars barely restrained him as Riker forced his arm through, trying to reach Lionel. </p><p>“How many days has it been?” Kyle asked Damian.</p><p>“About four full days since we stopped, sir.”</p><p>“Hmm… He still seems a bit too feisty. Open the cage.”</p><p>Damian carried out the order. Riker pounced on Kyle, but the gang leader immediately parried his attacks and flipped him onto the ground, slamming him down hard. </p><p>Riker gagged, a slight froth coming from his mouth, but he was far too weak to sit up. Lionel could tell Riker had not eaten for a day or so; the food platter was still filled in the cage. Riker had barely touched it.</p><p>Kyle dragged Riker away from the room, Damian shutting the door behind them. A cold shiver ran down Lionel’s spine. <em>What in the world are they attempting?</em></p><p>Riker was tossed into an empty room and tied down to a wooden chair, Kyle being the only other person inside. </p><p>“How are you feeling?”</p><p>“F… Fuck you…” Riker was still in a cold sweat, his eyes bloodshot as he tried to keep his head up. </p><p>Kyle placed his hands on Riker’s shoulder, who began to struggle but was unable to break free of the ropes and Kyle’s iron grip.</p><p>“Inspect. Analyze. Identify.”</p><p>Nothing appeared. </p><p>“Interesting.” Kyle thought he might have been able to see a statistical table of Riker or at least a status effect of some sort, but they did not exist. He tried a few more words, but nothing happened. <em>Hmm…</em></p><p>He began to examine Riker carefully, checking his eye reactions, heartbeat, pulse, and so on. <em>If only I had a full medical wing here. A side project for the future.</em></p><p><em>Noted symptoms: Increased heart rate, sweating, hot and cold flashes, hallucinations, and perhaps loss of vision, not unlike dehydration.</em></p><p>“Riker.” Kyle stood in front of him, snapping his fingers to catch the prisoner’s attention. </p><p>“If you defeat me now, I’ll let you go and give you this potion.” Kyle pulled a Stamina Potion from his suit’s inner pocket.</p><p>Riker’s eyes were suddenly rejuvenated with life, and his head nodded vigorously. As soon as Kyle removed the ropes, Riker attacked without hesitation. </p><p>Kyle did not counter-attack this time, merely dodging left and right as he observed Riker’s muscle movements and reaction timing. <em>Too slow, too weak, lack of awareness. A shadow of his former self. Perfect.</em></p><p>“I’ve seen enough.” </p><p>“N-No, wait. P-Please!” His hands tried to grab onto Kyle, missing completely as he collapsed onto the floor. Kyle tied him up again with ease and returned him to his cage.</p><p>Damian and Keith waited for him in the office.</p><p>“Continue to feed Riker, but do not give him any more Euria-infused potions.” Kyle plopped down into his chair. “Moving forward, we will split the remainder of the prisoners into three groups: not infused potions, Euria-infused potions administered non-stop, and Euria-infused potions only administered on the first day.</p><p>Each gang member will rotate and defeat one of each group every day in combat. At the end of the day, I’ll heal all of them. Got it?”</p><p>Damian nodded, leaving the room to pass down the modified training regimen. </p><p>“Sir, a few people have shown up at the entrance, wanting to join the Seven Snakes,” Keith informed.</p><p><em>Faster than I expected. </em>“Have them gather in my office as soon as possible.”</p><p>Ten young men rushed in soon after. They lined up, their eyes eager as they stared at Kyle. Niko was among them, having quit his factory job after witnessing Kyle’s performance first-hand, completely enamored by the prospect of gang life and strength. How could he accept languishing in mediocrity when greatness was right in front of him?</p><p>Kyle recognized most of them as onlookers from his fight with the Red Lions. He got up from his chair and inspected them for any irregularities. As he returned to the first of them, he suddenly launched a high kick towards the man’s face, only stopping mere millimeters away from it. The man barely had time to react, only stumbling a step backward a few moments later.</p><p>“If you’re here, you know what you’re signing up for. Death is a real possibility.” Kyle returned to his standing position. “I am not looking for men who simply want to take it easy or boss others around. Mutual loyalty is an integral part of how I run our group. Do right by me, and I’ll do the same for you, no matter what happens.”</p><p><em>I was right to come here! </em>Niko’s heart swelled with happiness, his fist clenching as he praised himself for making the right choice. His prior factory job was soulless, with the manager barely caring if anyone died or went missing. They were just numbers to be replaced. Kyle’s words had struck a chord with Niko, causing him and a few others to nod their heads vigorously.</p><p>Kyle’s modus operandi for the Seven Snakes was vastly different from the Red Lions’. His former life as a galactic crime lord had taught him an important lesson in fostering loyalty among even the lowest of members. </p><p>He did not do it because he was nice. Conversely, he had identified this method as the most secure in preventing betrayals. Something he did not do very well in his former life. </p><p><em>Performing a small beneficial action that is ultimately meaningless to me will mean a great deal to the recipient and will build loyalty over time. A minute cost for a great benefit.</em> Kyle gently smiled as he noticed the expressions on their faces. </p><p>“There is a war with the Red Lions coming in about ten to thirteen days. If anyone wants to back out now, this is your last chance,” Kyle said, his eyes cold and serious. </p><p>None of them backed out, standing firmly. All of them knew of the conflict. For some, it was why they had signed up in the first place. It meant a chance to get into a good position with the winning side, and everyone here knew exactly who was about to win.</p><p>“Good. Keith will now induct you. At the end, I will present each of you with an armband as associates.” Kyle showed them the Seven Snakes armband bearing an elaborate crest. </p><p>A clear wave of excitement rippled through the ten men. <em>Formal ceremonies to make them feel important are also critical to retaining loyalty. </em></p><p>The men left the office with Keith in the lead to give them a tour of the base. Kyle headed to the kitchen again, this time staring at the strength potion that now had its full description.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Strength Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Boost muscle strength for a short duration. Good for quick battles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Recommended Usage</strong>: Drink the entire flask in one go. Active for five minutes. Consuming another within a day will result in diminishing effects. May experience side effects after the main effect wears off. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Greis Powder, Olio Roots, Yul’s Tears, Water. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He sent two members to collect the required materials—Olio Roots and Yul’s Tears—which came separately in a sack and pot. </p><p>Kyle’s face scrunched at the reported price of the Yul’s Tears. A five kilogram pot was more than ten thousand rakels. <em>I only hope the recipe isn’t too intensive on the percentage of Yul’s Tears used…</em></p><p>He internally cursed the Alchemists’ Guild and Haui for not providing the recipe. However, Kyle was cognizant that he would have done the same. Recipes and methods of production were far too precious to be freely distributed in this kind of city.</p><p>The same brute-force method was employed as the last time, but with more than four ingredients in the mix, the number of potential combinations was a lot higher. Kyle brought in a few helpers to speed up the process, utilizing the numerous arcite stoves to iterate continually.</p><p>At one point, he had more than ten flasks going. He wrote down combinations on parchment, and crossed them out when he had failed.</p><p>Keith soon peeked his head in. “Sir, they’re ready for the ceremony.”</p><p>Instead of being irritated at being interrupted during the process, he put everything down and moved to the common area, where the men were already lined up.</p><p>They had already seen Kyle hard at work, so the action of him immediately stopping just for them made them feel even more valued.</p><p>The ceremony was a simple oath to the gang, and Kyle personally fastened their armbands onto their sleeves. “You are now official members of the Seven Snakes and under my protection. I will fight through Hell and back to ensure your safety, and I only ask you to do the same for your comrades—and me.”</p><p>The men bowed with true respect. “Yes, sir!”</p><p><em>The loyalty will take a few days to truly instill</em>,<em> but it’s a start.</em></p><p>Keith showed them to their bunks while Kyle continued trying to figure out the recipe.</p><p>The process proved to be difficult. There were a huge number of potential combinations, and Kyle didn’t know when he would complete it—too many variables were present in the recipe. He now understood why Damian said reverse-engineering alchemy was nearly impossible without a hint or a guiding book. </p><p>As he completed his sixtieth failed potion, a new title appeared for him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Potion Crafter (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>This title was supposed to be given on successful potions, but the failures are pretty hard to watch. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> +10 INT, increased accuracy of examined potions’ descriptions, +10% chance to craft an intermediate potion when using basic materials. +5% chance of discovering basic potion recipes per attempt. This effect can be stacked and is reset on discovery.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it was as though three pieces of information appeared in his head, partially informing him of what the recipe consisted of. <em>It seems that for every twenty attempts I make, one of the variables of the recipe is revealed. Hence, with sixty crafted, I now have three variables revealed.</em> </p><p>Kyle quickly drew a new combination table, narrowing it down to two variables, making it simpler. With time and more failed attempts, he locked down yet another variable. Kyle could already imagine Haui’s face if he knew exactly how Kyle was able to reverse-engineer recipes so quickly. </p><p>A few hours passed through dinnertime before he finally got the recipe down. “So, 15% Greis Powder, 15% Olio Roots, 35% Yul’s Tears, rest water. Boiled for five minutes.” Kyle nearly raged at the sheer amount of Yul’s Tears he had wasted, having finished the entire pot with only one Strength Potion to show for it. <em>At least another product has been completed. Infusing it with Euria should be possible too.</em></p><p>He didn’t try to reverse-engineer the health potion just yet. It was far too costly to waste Yul’s Tears on it. If the percentage were even higher, he might go bankrupt.</p><p>He sat back in his office, eating a late dinner, while Keith reported the daily finances to him. </p><p>“Sir, you can’t keep burning through money like this. We don’t have a lot of cash reserves left. Assuming you want to make another set of Strength Potions, it’s going to wipe us out for the rest of the month unless we get steady revenue.”</p><p>“It’s no problem. The expansion of the brothel will be finished in a few days. We’ll easily make it back, then. Who are the other rival gangs that are at odds with the Red Lions?”</p><p>“The Ilysian Punks and the Wretches are the main ones that come to mind, but they’ve been ignoring us for a long time.”</p><p>“I want the smaller gangs in adjacent districts, anyone the same size as us and lower, to get this message.” Kyle packed a few parchments into message tubes, handing them over to Keith.</p><p>“Ah, you want to ask for their help! I’ll send it right away.”</p><p>“No, Keith. We’re going to find some customers.”<h1><a id="_n8sr2o86pitc"></a>
