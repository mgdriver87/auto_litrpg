<p>Chapter  21: Forest Ambush</h1></p><p>“We’re camping here for the night; one more day to the Culdao Peaks.” The gruff man, who doubled as the driver, motioned to a rest area that other travelers had used countless times. It was a clearing in a forest a bit further away from the main road but still big enough to have ten people sleeping in comfort. </p><p>Kyle did not set up any equipment like the rest of them, simply sitting on the ground and leaning slightly against his backpack, observing the surroundings. </p><p>The stars were clearly visible, though the constellations were all far different from what Kyle could recognize. <em>Is the orientation different, or am I truly in a different world?</em> Kyle still couldn’t believe he had reincarnated in a different world, having grown up in the Galactic Era, where science dominated. </p><p>In any case, he could not read the stars—space travel in his former life was all done by A.I. star trackers that automatically did the calculations. He was not trained as a navigator either. However, he could see that the Milky Way Galaxy was not visible at all, a slightly faint pinkish hue enveloping the background instead. </p><p><em>I’ll figure it out when I gain more resources and power.</em> Kyle turned his attention back to the passengers. The three merchants were still bickering over the arrival of the inquisitors, making Kyle slightly regret not having bought the headband that supposedly silenced the environment. </p><p>“They are a feisty bunch, aren’t they?” one of the other passengers remarked as he sat down next to Kyle. He flicked his hood off, revealing glossy black hair slicked back and a small scar across his nose bridge. He held out a hand, offering a handshake. “Name’s Orthon, mercenary heading back to Culdao Peak. You?”</p><p>“Kris. I’m an herbalist, looking for new potential medicine there.” Kyle shook his hand briefly, noticing the calluses on his palm and the unmistakable mark of a sword wielder. </p><p>“Oh, without an escort? Could get pretty dangerous.” Orthon sized up Kyle, looking at his cloak and equipment, his eyes landing on the Aero Shoes for a while.</p><p>“Those three merchants seemed to be doing fine without any help.” Kyle noticed Orthon’s gaze but did not react. He eyed a repeating crossbow slung across Orthon’s back, loaded with bolts. It was extremely luxurious and ornamental—almost as if it were meant for nobility. An interesting violet mark was painted across its body, shaped like a demon.</p><p>“Of course, they got escorts! Me and my buddy, Troy.” Orthon motioned back toward the last passenger, who simply nodded as he re-tied his bow, checking the tension of the string. “It looked like an easy job; both of us were already heading that way, so we just grabbed some easy money along the way.”</p><p>“How much was it?”</p><p>“Oh, not much. Just three hundred rakels per person. Barely enough in total to buy a Strength Potion, but enough to survive if you know where to buy your food in Raktor. Why? Interested in hiring us?”</p><p>“Perhaps. I’m looking for native Euria Seeds.”</p><p>“Hmmm.” Orthon scratched his chin. “I know they are in the Culdao Peaks, but I don’t know where the largest concentration is. You might want to ask around in town.”</p><p> “Thanks. I’ll give it a shot.”</p><p>“No worries, mate. If you ever need help, just head down to the tavern and ask for me or Troy. We’ll be around for a month or two. Gonna go for a quick wee.” Orthon patted Kyle’s shoulder before leaving into the bushes, causing Kyle’s eyebrow to twitch slightly at being touched.</p><p>Kyle watched Orthon leave, shifted his backpack a bit further away from the campfire that was just set up and laid down to try and get some rest.</p><p>“Mr. Grayborn? Want any soup before resting?” the gruff man called out, but Kyle acted like he was sleeping soundly.</p><p>“Hey, I’ll gladly take his portion if he doesn't want it.” One of the merchants scooped a bowl quickly and gulped it down, burping with satisfaction. The gruff man also drank the soup, with Troy watching them intently.</p><p>Soon, they fell fast asleep, the rumbling of snores echoing through the rest area. Troy pretended to sleep as well, waiting for the merchants to be in a deep slumber. As soon as they did, his eyes slowly opened. <em>Time to make a move. </em></p><p>He slowly got up and turned his head, looking into the forest, before signaling with a soft whistle three times. Slowly realizing something was wrong, he glanced around the area. <em>Where is Kris Grayborn? His backpack is still here. Did Orthon make a move first?</em></p><p>Wary, he retrieved his bow and was about to walk out into the treeline when someone suddenly dropped onto him from above, slamming him onto the ground with both knees pinning his shoulder blades. </p><p>“ARGH—” Troy screamed, but a ragged piece of cloth was stuffed into his mouth, muffling the sound. Unable to turn around, he felt five hammer strikes hit his body at different positions of his limbs, causing him to yelp in pain. </p><p>Kyle walked off to grab a rope from his backpack, while Troy immediately spat out the cloth and tried to stand up, pulling out a knife sheathed in his belt and aiming it at Kyle. Kyle did not react, simply walking toward Troy with the rope. </p><p>Before Troy could move a single inch, the delayed pain from the neon red arctech hammer kicked in, causing him to scream again. Kyle immediately lunged forward and grabbed his cheeks, toppling Troy’s head into the ground with a loud thud and knocking him out. </p><p>Despite the screams, the merchants and driver did not wake up, barely budging. <em>Drugged by the soup…</em> Kyle tied Troy up and dragged him into the treeline, hiding his body in the bushes. Kyle waited at another position, planning to ambush anyone coming. </p><p>After a few minutes, two men and Orthon walked out of the treeline toward the campfire with large grins on their faces. “We’re getting rich today, boys! Check the merchants for any emergency response devices. Can’t have them calling them on us.”</p><p>The two men complied, moving forward, when suddenly Orthon grabbed them by the shoulder. “Wait! Something isn’t right! Troy and the new guy are missing!” </p><p>Just as the two men began to glance around, a shadow lunged out from the sides, accelerated by his shoes. The shadow swung a neon red hammer, delivering a direct uppercut to the first man, immediately knocking him out cold. </p><p>“Shit!” Orthon cursed, pulling out his own sword. The other man began to panic as Kris leapt and weaved around him before delivering a sweeping kick and swinging the hammer in a downward strike as the man fell. </p><p>The hammer strike cracked the man’s ribs, causing bone splinters to jut out from under the skin from the sheer force. Another swift kick to the head knocked out the man for good as well. </p><p>A sudden swing of the sword forced Kyle to back off, the sound of air rippling as Orthon grunted. “Who the fuck are you? An enforcer? Or the Veiled Angels? I doubt you’re a Cretin—Sebastian would have you flogged for this.” Orthon didn’t chase after Kyle, instead retrieving the ornate repeating crossbow with his free hand, the cocking mechanism engraved with arcia. </p><p>Kyle assumed the force of each shot would be light due to the size, but the arcia enchantments along the length improved the force, accelerating the bolts faster than he expected. Two bolts whizzed past his head, while a third hit him in the left shoulder, causing him to stumble back. Blood trickled out as Kyle staggered, pain jolting through his nerves like a sharp lightning bolt.</p><p>“Never expected this, huh?” Orthon grinned, gripping the sword with the other hand and approaching carefully, assuming the stance of a well-trained sword duelist. With a powerful step forward, Orthon unleashed a three-move combo, swinging with all his might. </p><p>He nearly nailed Kyle with the second swing, but on the third swing, Kyle suddenly parried with the handle of his hammer before closing in the gap in a daring forward step, catching Orthon off guard. Capitalizing on the surprise, Kyle threw a strong left hook right into Orthon’s jaw, knocking him back into a daze. </p><p>Orthon was no slouch, quickly using his sword to force Kyle to back off, though the latter was already well prepared, dancing around Orthon despite the bolt in his left shoulder. With another exchange, another knee to the stomach from Kyle caused Orthon to collapse to the floor. Kyle swung the hammer down on the back of his opponent’s head three times, knocking him out cold as blood trickled through the man’s hair.</p><p>Kyle panted, moved to a tree stump, and slumped against it. Luckily for him, the crossbow bolt was fairly shallow and not fully embedded in the bone. Kyle used his fingers with grit, digging into the exposed flesh himself as he winced. He located the arrowhead and slowly eased it out, bearing the pain. </p><p>Soon, he managed to pull out the entire shaft and arrowhead and used the Necklace of Healing to heal himself lightly as a temporary measure. The wound sealed up as a green aura surged around it, boosted by his Healer title. </p><p><em>Nifty for post-battles, but that’s assuming I win the battle in the first place. </em>Kyle stood up, testing his shoulder’s articulation. The healing had yet to be complete—Kyle would have to channel it a few times later. Picking up Orthon’s crossbow, he examined it. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Ornate Repeater Crossbow (Intermediate)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle had yet to acquire a ranged weapon, so he held on to it, slinging it behind him. He walked up to one of the unconscious attackers, wondering what to do with him. </p><p>Kyle noticed he had not gained any EXP so far. The last time he had gotten any EXP was only when he killed Ulon Baktar, the former Seven Snakes gang leader. Even beating up a dozen Red Lions did not net him anything. <em>Is the System forcing me to kill? That’s fine, but surely I can get more benefits out of it?</em></p><p>He retrieved Troy’s dropped knife, using it to quickly slit the throat of one of the unconscious men, killing him on the spot. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Forest Bandit, +50 EXP.</p><p></p><p>Kyle waited for a while, noticing there were no new titles. <em>Perhaps I have to do it differently.</em> He walked up to the second unconscious man, slitting his wrists and allowing the blood to seep out slowly. He then stabbed the man a few times, causing him to wake up from the sheer pain and scream out. It ended with a quick jab to the nose, knocking the man back out. </p><p>Soon, the blood formed a sizeable puddle, prompting another System Message to appear in front of him.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Forest Bandit, +50 EXP.</p><p></p><p><em>Huh, let’s focus on getting information, then. </em>Kyle moved on to the next. This time, he grabbed Troy’s body and slapped him awake. </p><p>“Burh…” Troy groaned as he was abruptly woken up before his eyes narrowed in shock. He tried to break free of the rope that tied his arms and legs.</p><p>“Who are you affiliated with? Why did you guys assume I was the Veiled Angels?”</p><p>“W-What? I—” Troy was still lightheaded from the previous concussion but soon shrieked in pain as Kyle used the knife to dig into the ribs.</p><p>“Answer.”</p><p>“I… We’re affiliated with the Violet Demons! We hijack caravans for them! Please let me go!” Troy struggled against the knife while he began bleeding profusely.</p><p>“How many of you are there?”</p><p>“Twenty, no… forty! Sixty! Let me go now, or they’ll hunt you down! Orthon is a big shot among us. If you kill him or me, you’re dead meat!” Troy tried to intimidate Kyle, but the galactic crime lord was not having any of it.</p><p>“So I’m questioning the wrong person then,” Kyle summarized before pulling out the knife and stabbing Troy in the heart. Troy’s body convulsed violently for a few seconds, his limbs twitching until he finally slumped over and died.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Forest Bandit Troy, +100 EXP</p><p></p><p><em>Last try, then. </em>Kyle walked up to the unconscious Orthon, tying him up with a rope and slapping him awake.</p><p>“Uhh… wha… WHAT?!” Orthon stared in shock, unable to come to terms with the sheer amount of blood and gore around him. His comrades’ bodies were stacked next to him, dripping slowly in a dark-red snaking river that oozed toward him. “You… Who the fuck are you!? What kind of enforcer does this?”</p><p>“Who says I’m an enforcer?” Kyle suddenly stabbed a knife deep into Orthon’s thigh, gouging the bone. “I’m the one asking the questions here. Answer correctly, or else you’ll end up like them.”</p><p>“I’m not going to give you any—GRRRNNH!” Orthon winced as the knife was buried deeper with a twist, the pain nearly causing him to scream.</p><p>Kyle didn’t stop, continuing to twist. “STOP! STOP, OKAY?! PLEASE!” Orthon relented after three more twists, his thigh already a bloodied mess through his pants. </p><p>“Where is the forest bandit’s base?”</p><p>“South of here, seven kilometers. Wooden fortress, you can’t miss it.”</p><p>“How many of them are there?”</p><p>“There’s… about twenty-five of us.”</p><p><em>So Troy really was useless. Or Orthon is lying. </em>“All as equipped as you?”</p><p>“No… ARGGGHHH! YES, YES! WE HAVE BOWS AND CROSSBOWS!”</p><p>Kyle stopped twisting the knife for a moment, thinking deeply. Orthon noticed the hesitation in Kyle’s eyes. “T-That’s right! If you kill me off as well, my comrades are going to be hunting you down! No one escapes us in this forest. This is our home ground!”</p><p>“That sounds bad.”</p><p>“Yes, it is. So if you wanna live, you’ll—” Orthon couldn’t speak any more, his eyes bulging as he choked on his blood, his windpipe sliced open cleanly by the knife. He stared at Kyle, who did not even continue to look at him, walking off. Kyle couldn’t care less about the gurgling forest bandits—he was more occupied with the new system messages in front of his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
