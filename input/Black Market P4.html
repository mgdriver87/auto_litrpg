<p></p><p>Chapter 41: First Volley</p><p>“So, you’re the Seven Snakes’ dedicated brewer?”</p><p>“And you’re the new arctech designer. How did Kyle enslave you?” </p><p>Gordon had a confused expression on his face. “Enslave? He helped install me as the factory manager.” Gordon was now working on a large arctech radio, a modification ordered by Kyle. </p><p>He wondered as to why he would need a radio that large. <em>Is he planning to run his own radio station or something? With this throughput, the radio can reach the entire city. Or is he trying to make sure he can reach something?</em></p><p>Eric Dicar scoffed, “Idiot, you know that you’re not truly free. If you ran right now, Kyle would chase you to hell himself. Mark my words.”</p><p>“But why would I run? I already feel like I'm at the top of the world here! I don’t see you running either.”</p><p>“I… I have recipes to learn.”</p><p>“And I have engravings to learn too!”</p><p>Gordon and Eric exchanged a knowing look, having met for the first time. They were now in Gordon’s factory office, waiting for a supposed meeting with Kyle. </p><p>“So… you too?” Eric queried.</p><p>“It seems we both have our suspicions. Why don’t you start first?” Gordon motioned with his hand.</p><p>“I postulate that Kyle is a time traveler.”</p><p>“Impossible, I’ve asked around. He used to be known as Alvin before his current personality took over.”</p><p>“Fine. Time traveled and took over a body. Soul possession or something.”</p><p>“Wait, you believe in souls?”</p><p>“I sometimes feel my soul leaving my body after a bad drink.”</p><p>Gordon groaned. “Look, that’s a bit too farfetched. I have a better theory—Alvin was the original amnesiac, and Kyle was his original personality! He is probably from a foreign land, perhaps beyond the Great Waves, that has much better technology than us.”</p><p>“Okay, now that’s ridiculous. Everyone knows there’s nothing beyond the Great Waves.”</p><p>“You don’t know that for sure! Just because no one made it back does not mean that there is nothing out there.”</p><p>“Pssh, and you dare diss my soul theory?!”</p><p>The doors to the office swung open to reveal Kyle striding in. Without skipping a beat, he headed over to the only remaining military crate in the Seven Snakes’ district, pulling out a mortar and a cannonball. Kyle got straight to the point. “We need to create an improved version of this.”</p><p>Eric and Gordon immediately snapped out of their previous conversation, paying Kyle their undivided attention. “Improve?! Using this is basically waging a full-scale war!”</p><p>“Exactly, which is why I called the two of you.”</p><p>Gordon nodded but soon glanced at Eric. “Wait, I understand why you would need me, but why Eric?”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>Two weeks later…</em></p><p>Makoa stood on a balcony, overlooking a large square where 150 Ilysian Punks were gathered to assault the Seven Snakes’ district. He watched as they loaded up their pistols and armor, some even stocking up on potions. </p><p>This was the staging area, not far from the Seven Snakes district. <em>Never before did I have to use this many punks to crush a single district… </em>It had been a month since the loss of his base, with Makoa preparing everything in advance for this assault.</p><p>“Sir, your gauntlets and recharged shield are ready. General Javel reminds you that the shield is extremely precious. In the event that you lose, you must destroy the shield to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.” One of the Ilysian Punks’ messengers reported to him. </p><p>“I understand. Send my thanks to Javel.” <em>This is my last chance at redemption, so I’m not going to let it slip away. It’s all or nothing!</em> “Get all the squad leaders into this room. It is time for the briefing.”</p><p>With the squad leaders gathered in front of the map of the Seven Snakes’ district, Makoa began his explanation. The entire operation was designed in a military fashion, as many of the squad leaders were former Versia military soldiers. </p><p>“We will strike from three points—north, northwest, and south. The main bulk force will be through the north, with a hundred allocated to them. Each squad will have ten members and focus on rooting out the Seven Snakes and forcing them to surrender.”</p><p>“What about civilians? We won’t know who’s supporting them or not.”</p><p>“No indiscriminate killing—we don’t want to turn the local populace against us. We’re targeting the Seven Snakes themselves. Collateral damage is fine, but under no circumstances—”</p><p>Before Makoa could continue, a sudden whizzing sound could be heard in the air, sparking an instinct long drilled into him from past Versian wars. “MORTAR ATTACK!” </p><p>The Ilysian Punks immediately vacated the open areas, heading into the buildings around the staging area as Makoa spotted a projectile hurtling through the air toward them from the balcony. The projectile slammed into the cobblestone floor of the staging area, completely missing everybody. </p><p>“Hah! They misse—” </p><p>A billowing sphere of fire and flames burst out from the projectile, exploding in a dazzling explosion that rocked the entire area. The glass rumbled with ferocity as the shockwave rippled through the area. </p><p>Thousands of small fragments were flung in all directions from each projectile, slamming into the walls and windows, shattering them. A few unfortunate Ilysian Punks who were looking through the windows were immediately impaled by the ensuing onslaught of glass shards, crying out in pain. </p><p>The characteristic tubing sound of the mortars could be heard as they slowly sailed over the buildings, raining even more fragments down onto the area. A few of the projectiles even exploded in mid-air, coating the ground with fragments. </p><p><em>What kind of mortar explosive is that?! What the hell is going on?</em></p><p>“SQUAD LEADERS, GET YOUR MEN OUT OF HERE AND LAUNCH A FULL ASSAULT! STICK TO THE PLAN!“ Makoa roared under the booming explosions. The squad leaders were all trained, immediately following the orders and bellowing commands on their respective arctech radios. </p><p>The conflict had begun. </p><p>The sounds of explosions and gunfire frightened the local residents caught in an all-out conflict between the Seven Snakes and the Ilysian Punks. </p><p>“Can the Seven Snakes win this? What is going to happen to us when the Ilysian Punks take over?”</p><p>“I don’t even think Kyle can beat the Ilysian Punks. Their entire attack force is here!”</p><p>The streets were rife with chaos as the Ilysian Punks pushed their way into the Seven Snakes district. The squads worked in a disciplined fashion, clearing the urban blocks, building by building. </p><p>In a residential building, a family of four was cowering in the room, barricading their door. The dull thuds of mortar fire and screams could be heard echoing down the rows of apartment buildings and bouncing off the cracked walls. The father quickly grabbed his two daughters, keeping their heads down while he flipped tables, using them as cover against any potential entry from the front door.</p><p>“Stay quiet!” the father warned the daughters. </p><p>“Daddy, what’s happening?”</p><p>Before the father could respond, the door was slammed violently, causing the two daughters to shriek. The father and mother desperately tried to cover their mouths, but the youngest was already on the verge of tears. </p><p>Muffled voices from beyond the barricaded doors could be heard, the foreign accent of Versia clear as day. “Sir, there seem to be people in this room. Should we breach?”</p><p>“Smash down the door or set it on fire. Our job is to clear each marked building of Seven Snakes and those in them. We don’t have time to vet the residents. Clear the safehouse, then burn everything else!”</p><p>“Yes, sir.” </p><p>The Ilysian Punks were not out to wantonly kill residents but to flush out the hideouts or safehouses of the Seven Snakes. Unfortunately for the family of four, there was a regular safehouse of the Seven Snakes located in this building, forcing the Ilysian Punks to clear it out.</p><p>The father’s eyes darted around the family’s house, the living room now a mess from the chaos. <em>I need a weapon, fast!</em> He grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter, holding it closely as he kept his ears peeled, listening for any additional footsteps. </p><p>Instead of hearing an attempt to break down the door, a matchstick striking sound could be heard before the distinctive roar of fire crackling from beyond could be heard. The father’s heart plummeted, but he kept his face stern. <em>I have to stay strong, at least for my daughters.</em></p><p>Before long, a thick cloud of smoke began to waft through the seams of the barricaded door. “Daddy, the door is on fire!” the youngest cried out in a shrill voice, finally beginning to panic.</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s okay. Just stay calm.” The father calmed them down, handing them wet cloth as a temporary stopgap measure. It wouldn’t be of much use, but right now it was better than nothing as he tried to look for a way out. </p><p>The mother was also beginning to panic, worried about the impending asphyxiation. “We need to open the windows to let the smoke out, quickly!”</p><p>“No! Don’t open the windows, they’ll—” The father tried to stop his wife, but as soon as the mother swung the windows open, a single rifle shot nailed her right in the chest, piercing her heart instantly. Her body felt back on the floor, convulsing from the pain. </p><p>“FUCK!” the father yelled, quickly scrambling over to the wife. “I told you not to open the windows; they’ll think you’re trying to shoot at them!”</p><p>The wife tried to reply but could not utter a word as the bullet was lodged deep in her heart, the blood filling her innards and lungs. “Don’t worry; I’ll save you. Damian will be here in no time with a health potion. Just stay awake, stay awake. Stay with me.” The father desperately gripped the hand of his wife as he tried to find something to stem the bleeding.</p><p>Time seemed to drag on as the continued crying of his daughters and the pained breaths of his wife lasted for an eternity. The echoes of gunfire, explosions, and mortars whizzing through the air were the only music he heard.</p><p>Soon, the wife’s hand lost its grip, her eyes gazing into the far beyond. The father could not say anything, only doubling over in shock.</p><p>Just as he began to sob, the sounds of the Ilysian Punks reentering the building could be heard. “Where’s did they shoot at?! Which room? Blow it up!”</p><p>The father immediately racked his brains, trying to figure out an escape plan, but was at a complete loss. Even if he tried to escape via the now-open windows with his daughters, he would simply be shot down in a similar fashion. Rappelling down to the lower floor was tantamount to suicide.</p><p>He could try to extinguish the fire, but it would be a clear sign to the Ilysian Punks that someone was still alive in the room. <em>Where the fuck are the Seven Snakes?! Aren’t they supposed to protect the district?! </em>The father put his ears to the room's wall, trying to hear beyond the fire.</p><p>However, sounds of fighting suddenly could be heard beyond the crackling of flames. “It’s the Seven Snakes! Kill them all!”</p><p>Gunfire and metal clashes echoed through the walls of the buildings, the cries of men falling. “Why aren’t my bullets hurting hi- ARGHHH”</p><p>A squelching sound could be heard, along with the snapping of bones. Soon, loud footsteps could be heard over the fire approaching the room. The father quickly moved from the wall, grabbing a knife from the kitchen and preparing to defend himself. “Get behind me, quickly!” he urged the daughters. </p><p>The barricaded door was suddenly wrenched apart, the fire hardly affecting the man who began to clear the barricade. “Anyone alive!?” the man roared in.</p><p>“Damian, I’m here! I’m here!”</p><p>“Alex, fuck! I’m coming in!” Damian shoved away the burnt wooden debris, running in. His eyes landed on the wife’s body, stunned. Damian tried to find the words to console him, but Alex just shook his head, tears streaming down his face. </p><p>“You need to move. We have shelters nearby. We’ll give Martha a proper burial. Think of your daughters!” Damian urged, the sounds of fighting still echoing down the streets. </p><p>Alex finally nodded in agreement, quickly hoisting up his wife’s body while Damian carried the two daughters. As Damian passed the other Seven Snakes associates in his crew who were also in the building, he ordered them to check every other room and save whoever they could. </p><p>“Grab whatever equipment you can from the dead bodies! We need everything we can to fight them off!”</p><p>The two of them ran down the open street, hugging close to the building walls. With the local enforcers keeping a wide berth of the conflict as per their agreement, nothing was preventing both sides from devolving into a brutal conflict. </p><p>They soon reached a barricaded street, with countless sandbags and makeshift wooden palisades serving as cover. It protected a chunk of the street, where many of the local residents were already evacuated. </p><p>Alex’s scenario was not unique, with many losing their loved ones or being forced to abandon them in the heat of the conflict. Damian grimaced as he watched the forlorn faces of those he personally knew. He had grown up in the district with Keith, after all, and many of those here were like kin to him. </p><p>“Alex, stay here with your daughters. Take shelter in the basement over there.” Damian pointed out a stairwell at the side of a building that led deeper. “We have food and water to last a few days if needed.”</p><p>However, Alex did not move, instead grabbing Damian by the shoulder, his eyes burning with revenge. “No, Damian, I don’t need food and water. I need a weapon.”</p><p>Chapter 42: Close Quarters</p><p>Eric Dicar winced as he plugged his ears with his finger, the screeching sound of the mortar tubes and the deafening thuds nearly blasting his eardrums apart. “I didn’t sign up to be an artillery crew!”</p><p>Gordon wiped the sweat off his brow as he and two other associates lugged a custom-made metal spherical ball and loaded it into the base of the mortar before closing the hatch. “CLEAR!” Gordon yelled and pressed the trigger.</p><p>The ten arcite fuel packs, stacked haphazardly next to the mortar, chugged furiously. They powered the acceleration engravings along the side of the tubes that were currently glowing red hot. With a bang, the metal ball was lobbed up high and far away, sailing toward a building far away.</p><p>Adrian’s voice crackled over the arctech radio. [You’re off target. You need to hit it fifty meters to the right!] </p><p>“Fuck!” Gordon cursed, motioning to Eric to prepare the next batch of explosive. It’d already been three hours since the battle had begun, with their mortar performing the first strike. </p><p>There was not enough time to mass-produce the explosives, requiring Eric to mix them on the spot. The formula was far too dangerous for others to handle—a simple rounding error in the percentages may very well cause the projectile to blow up in the associates’ hands. </p><p>The fighting with the Ilysian Punks had yet to spread through the whole district, with only the northern blocks embroiled in conflict. Damian, Monica, and Niko were in charge of the defense, helping save the local residents as well as stem the incoming assault of the Ilysian Punks.</p><p>However, they were clearly far outnumbered—it was a nearly three-to-one disadvantage. What helped the Seven Snakes hold their ground was the armor and handguns provided to them, allowing them to survive for longer than expected.</p><p>Damian gritted his teeth as he activated the “Harden” engraving on his body, protecting himself from a gunshot as he fought in the ruined Golden Snake casino. The engraving had boosted his internal arcia energy, along with the nonstop training in the arcite chamber. </p><p>Grabbing a half-broken metal chair, he swung it around as a weapon, knocking out two punks onto the ground as the rest of his crew clashed in an all-out melee brawl. Countless casino chips and cards were scattered on the ground as the Ilysian Punks continued their objective of wrecking every Seven Snakes hideout and business. </p><p>Damian continued undeterred, focusing on making sure none of the associates under him died by blocking for them. The enemy squad leader cursed as he checked his arcite fuel pack’s level, being the only one with an arctech pistol.</p><p>With a loud roar, Damian immediately targeted him and charged, slamming into his waist and tackling him onto the ground. The arctech pistol was knocked out of his hand, disconnecting from the arcite fuel pack and clattering against the floor amid the sounds of yelling and punches. The two enemy gang members grappled each other in a desperate life-or-death match, trying to suffocate each other.</p><p>Damian’s eyes landed on the arctech pistol lying on the corner, reaching out with one hand to try and grab it. They tussled and tumbled on the ground, throwing punches at each other while both of them scrambled for the arctech pistol.</p><p>The enemy squad leader managed to grab the pistol again, desperately trying to reconnect it with his fuel pack, when he realized his fuel pack had already been crushed by Damian. The momentary shock left him open, allowing Damian to deliver a rapid combo of three punches and knock him down again. “Stay down, cunt.”</p><p>The enemy squad leader tried to get up but was suddenly hit on the head by a metal pipe that nearly caved his skull in and caused blood to spurt through his hair. “THIS IS FOR MARTHA, YOU FUCK!” Alex slammed the pipe down repeatedly, bellowing out his rage.</p><p>Damian did not stop him. He himself was also angered at the Ilysian Punks for what they had done to Keith. He checked in with the rest of his crew, of which five were seriously injured. “Head back to the shelter and get more health potions.” </p><p>While the rest of the associates complied and carried the wounded, Alex did not listen, continuing to hit the Ilysian Punks squad leader in the face, mashing it into a mess of meat. “Alex. Alex. HEY, ALEX, STOP!” Damian shouted and grabbed Alex. “You’re injured too! Think of your daughters; they still want you alive back at the shelter!”</p><p>Alex was about to shrug him off until he yelled out in pain as Damian poked a finger in Alex’s gaping wound on his waist. “There’s plenty more of these fuckers to take revenge on. You need to stay alive!”</p><p>“Huff… Huff… You’re right. Sorry.” Alex took a deep breath and staggered toward the exit of the casino, nearly fumbling onto the floor before Damian quickly supported him. </p><p>The crew headed back to the shelter, rotating with another squad, which headed out to defend them. Already, the exhaustion was visible on the Seven Snakes associates, barely propped up by the Stamina Potions. However, the potions did not alleviate the mental fatigue from the close-quarters combat in the city. </p><p>At the Lusty Arcian, Niko and Slavin were involved in a desperate, protracted battle, both sides firing at each other in the large, expansive lobby of the beauty school, with broken pots and mirrors strewn on the floor. Makeshift barricades and tables were used as cover that Niko crouched behind. In his right hand was a handgun crafted by Kyle. </p><p>“How long more till the Red Lions attack the Ilysian Punks?! They must know we’re in shit by now!” Niko roared into his arctech radio as yet another shot whizzed past his cover.</p><p>[I don’t know, but the Red Lions don’t seem to be making a single move!]</p><p>“WHAT?! Then what the hell are we buying time for?!” Niko cursed. “We’re going to lose the Lusty Arcian and maybe even the Seductive Serpent at this rate!”</p><p>[There are even bigger issues—there’s a fifty-man-strong squad from the Ilysian Punks moving to the south of us!]</p><p>Niko’s face baulked. He was under the impression that the force attacking them right now was the main force. <em>There’s more?!</em></p><p>[Sasha and I will handle it.] Kyle suddenly spoke on the communication channel. </p><p>On the roof of a building, Kyle laid down flat and mounted his arctech railgun, aiming down an open street. He peered through the scope, zooming in on the approaching Ilysian Punks.</p><p>Five squads marched down the open streets, all far more armored and equipped than the punks attacking in the north. Kyle noticed a wagon being escorted in the middle of their formation filled with arcite fuel packs, supposedly serving as their mobile supply station. </p><p>Kyle marked the five squad leaders but focused on one, who he fired the first bullet at. With a significant recoil, the metal ball nearly broke the speed of sound, hurtling toward the Ilysian Punks formation. </p><p>In an instant, the metal ball tore a hole through the squad leader’s head, killing him before he could even react. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Ilysian Punks Squad Leader”</p><p></p><p>“Fuck, the long-range cannon is here! Get to cover!” </p><p>Kyle fired two more times, killing yet another squad leader while missing another as the Ilysian Punks broke formation, sprinting all over the place. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Ilysian Punks Squad Leader”</p><p></p><p>The Ilysian Punks began to break into the nearby buildings and shops, using them as cover as they moved from door to door or through the alleyways to stay out of Kyle’s line of sight. </p><p>Kyle immediately unmounted the arctech railgun and began to head down to the ground floor himself. “Sasha, hunt them one by one before they spread too far into the district!”</p><p>[Yes, sir.] Sasha was already on the way there. This time, she wore a full coat, with the interior layered with arctech armor. The armor barely slowed her down as she sprinted down the streets toward the closest squad, who were disorganized as their leader had just collapsed. </p><p>The shop owners cowered in fear behind the cashier as half of an Ilysian Punks squad barged into the bakery. They quickly closed the door behind them, barricading themselves in as they hauled the shelves. “Shit, what do we do now? Our leader is dead. The arctech radio is on his body!”</p><p>Before anyone could offer their opinion or suggestion, Sasha kicked her way through the store glass, shattering the window. With a handgun in her hand, she fired three rounds in rapid succession at the closest Ilysian Punk—two in the body, one in the head. </p><p>She then ducked as another punk swung his crowbar at her head. Taking advantage of her position, she smashed her leg into his groin and deflected a punch coming from the side. In a flurry of jabs, punches, and kicks, she quickly knocked out four members. </p><p>The last surviving member ran out into the streets, yelling at the other Ilysian Punks. “The assassin is here! The assassin is here!”</p><p>Instead of chasing him down the streets, Sasha instead chose to exit the bakery through the back alleyways, trying to flank around and target another squad. However, the moment she turned the corner, a familiar metal gauntlet knocked right into her left shoulder, sending her soaring into the air as she twisted her body into recovery, the armor mitigating some of the damage. </p><p>“So we meet again, <em>assassin</em>. How much did the Seven Snakes pay you? Was it worth your life?” Makoa grinned, nine punks standing behind him in the alleyway with their arctech pistols at the ready. “Shoot her.”</p><p>Sasha gritted her teeth and activated her breastplate’s ability, sending out three dark-green projectiles that countered the volley of shots. However, six shots made it through, with three missing her and the remaining three nailing her in the thighs and waist, causing her to stagger onto the ground on one knee. </p><p>Makoa motioned with a single hand, the Ilysian Punks moving forward to finish her off. Sasha’s eyes burn with determination, unwilling to go down without a fight. </p><p>As the first knife was thrust at her, she deftly dodged and twisted the wrist holding the knife, forcing the attacking punk to drop it. She moved fluidly as she avoided and weaved through the attacks, parrying and slamming them into the walls. The healing engraving on her back worked overtime, but with the bullets lodged deep in her body, the wounds couldn’t be fully healed, causing her movement to slow down over time. </p><p>The pain surging from the embedded bullets caused her to falter slightly, a hit from a metal crowbar landing right on her back and slamming against the armor with a dull thud. Before she could recover her posture and counterattack, Makoa suddenly lunged toward her, delivering a flurry of punches that caved in her armor, shredding her full coat apart to reveal the dents underneath. </p><p>However, before Makoa could follow up, a loud, familiar bang slammed into his energy shield from behind, staggering him. <em>The long-range cannon—what?! </em>He turned around and saw who it was. “The Seven Snakes leader? GET HIM!” </p><p>The squad members turned and rushed the shooter, but the handgun in his left shot with precision, firing three times in quick succession. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Ilysian Punks Thug”</p><p></p><p>The remaining squad members were undeterred and rushed at him, swinging wildly from all angles. Kyle dropped his handgun onto the floor and wielded his arctech railgun with both hands, using it like a blunt staff. </p><p><em>Penchant for Violence.</em></p><p>His body surged with strength as his muscles slightly enlarged, and his perception was also mildly improved. With the additional free points added to the stats, the  boost was becoming more apparent to Kyle. Even his brain seemed to run at a faster speed, allowing him to react faster. <em>This is like a Galactic Era combat stimulant.</em></p><p>The first attacker gritted his teeth and swung a crowbar from the right, but the reach failed to hit Kyle as he took a step back.</p><p>He jabbed the barrel of the railgun into the stomach of the first attacker like a spear before swinging it down on another attacker, coming at him from another side in a downward hit. He immediately swiveled to use his railgun’s body to block a bullet fired by a punk who had managed to reload during the fight. </p><p>Kyle charged forward with the railgun, slamming its body into the nearest attackers and crushing their bones with a single hit. A solid jab was enough to cause a punk to be knocked out of the fight, whimpering on the ground from the pain. </p><p>Makoa was astonished by the sheer strength Kyle possessed despite his lean stature. <em>Where is he getting this power from? He doesn’t even have an arcite fuel pack! Is he a mage?</em></p><p>Kyle slammed the butt of his railgun down on an incapacitated punk’s neck, killing him instantly. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Ilysian Punks Thug”</p><p></p><p>“So, is this all you’ve got?”</p><p>Chapter 43: Demise</p><p>Makoa gasped for air as he crawled on the floor, the broken pieces of his metal gauntlet stabbing into his arms. A hand grabbed his head and lifted him up, causing him to grunt in pain. </p><p>Kyle bent over and touched Makoa's belt. </p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Ancient Personal Defense Shield</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Lost technology created in the Galactic Era. Limited to humans less than three meters tall. Usage depends on battery level. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Modified by Harrison. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Harrison? That’s the Versian man at the auction house. Interesting. </em>“Where did you get the energy shield from?” Kyle asked, lifting Makoa up by the neck with one hand alone and hoisting him over the bodies of twenty other Ilysian Punks thugs. </p><p>At the side, Sasha spat out a mouthful of blood while she moved her own hands within her bullet wounds, prying out the embedded metal pieces that fragmented within her flesh. Without a sound, she ripped the last metal piece from her thigh, finally activating the healing engraving on her back and sealing up the wound. </p><p>“Like I’m fucking going to tell you any—” Makoa yelled out in pain as Kyle twisted a knife into his waist. “Just kill me and get it over with.”</p><p>“You’re a precious hostage, and I have someone here who would love to have a chat with you.”</p><p>Makoa grinned with his bloodied teeth, half of them missing from the fight. “Are you sure this is over? I’m not the only one in the Ilysian Punks, you know.”</p><p>Kyle squinted his eyes while his arctech radio coincidentally crackled into life, with Adrian’s voice frantically shouting on the other side. [Kyle, they got another force coming to attack us!]</p><p>“Haven’t the Red Lions begun their assault on the Ilysian Punks?” Kyle dropped Makoa to the floor. </p><p>[I don’t know what Wrent is planning, but the Red Lions are not making a move at all!]</p><p>“Hah, fools!” Makoa laughed with a hoarse throat. “You thought the Red Lions were your allies and that you could use them to outplay us? They, too, want to see you in ruins! They won’t make a move until you’ve been wiped clean—only then will they enter this district and steal your potion production methods. General Javel will clean you up and then use this district as a trap for the Red Lions!”</p><p>In the northern district, Damian and Niko fought desperately against the new wave of Ilysian Punks who were now attacking the shelter. “Weren’t they supposed to have less than two hundred members? Where did these fuckers come from?!” Damian roared as he swung wildly with a makeshift club, his former weapon already broken in half. </p><p>Niko couldn’t reply; he was already slumped against the ground, breathing heavily as he tried to put pressure on his waist, which was bleeding profusely. “I… I think we’re fucked…”</p><p>“NO! Don’t give up on me, Niko! Stay awake!” Damian roared as he grabbed the arm of an Ilysian Punks thug and twisted it, using his body as a pivot. “Kyle will come to save us! I believe in him!”</p><p>What Damian did not know was that for all the enhancements Kyle had from the system, it was not possible for Kyle to reach them in an instant. It would take more than five minutes for Kyle to even make it over if he sprinted. </p><p>All around him, fellow Seven Snakes associates were falling down, the exhaustion from the hours of combat having finally taken its toll on them. Compared to the fresh Ilysian Punks, they were no match. </p><p>Even Damian was beginning to lose hope, wondering if this was how the Seven Snakes gang would come to its end. He grunted as he forced himself to keep fighting, trying to stem the tide of Punks. Behind him were thousands of local residents hiding in the basements. It was down to him to defend!</p><p>“ARGHHHH!” Damian bellowed as he fought with all his might, throwing punches and kicks. Soon, however, he was grappled to the ground by three punks, restraining him while he thrashed. </p><p>“Shut him up!” the enemy squad leader ordered, with Damian glancing at the blue sky as a metal pipe swung down onto him. Just as he flinched instinctively, he heard a cry of pain as the punks holding him down were knocked aside like bowling pins. </p><p>Damian opened his eyes to see a fluttering pearlish white coat stained with grime and blood as the wearer swung a warhammer around, smashing the skulls of the punks apart with the glowing yellow tip infused with engravings. <em>What?! An inquisitor?</em></p><p>The inquisitor rampaged through the street, swinging the warhammer with a single hand while her other hand wielded an arctech pistol, firing blatantly at the Ilysian Punks. “COME ON!” the inquisitor yelled, a wide grin on her face as she began to clobber everyone who got close to her. </p><p>“Shit, stop her! It’s the Mad Dog!” </p><p>Kitana laughed as she kicked a fallen punk’s chin and slammed the head of her warhammer on his head, crushing it into a paste. Her eyes glinted like a predator, marking each of the Ilysian Punks as she moved on like a one-man army, slaughtering her way through the new Ilysian Punks force. </p><p><em>Look at all this EXP bundled up together for me!</em> </p><p>The Ilysian Punks were no match for her strength, some of them horrified and trying to flee. Even shooting her was of no use, as the inquisitor coat was layered with projectile defense engravings as well. </p><p>Kitana sneered at the fleeing Ilysian Punks members, slamming her feet into the ground. A rush of yellow arcia trails snaked out across the ground with her foot as the source, causing the cobblestone to surge forward and wrap around the legs of twenty Ilysian Punks, making them unable to move. </p><p>“Wha… What the fuck is this!” one of the Ilysian Punks managed to exclaim before the warhammer’s head smashed his jaw into smithereens, along with a follow-up strike hitting his knees and snapping them off. </p><p>The restrained Ilysian Punks were horrified while their allies fled back to their district, carrying the wounded. Kitana smiled as she slowly walked up to the remaining nineteen Ilysian Punks. “By order of the Sanctum, you shall now be purged.”</p><p> * * *</p><p>General Javel’s face was grim as he watched the smoke plumes spiraling out toward the sky from the Seven Snakes district while Alejandro desperately tried to make sense of what was happening on the ground. “Sir, it seems our forces have been routed by the Seven Snakes. Half are either dead or captured, with the rest fleeing back into our districts.”</p><p>“And I assume the Red Lions are gearing up for an all-out attack at this very moment.”</p><p>“Yes… sir. The Wretches are also preparing for war, while the enforcers are aiming to raid us. It seems like the gamble has failed.”</p><p>“Not yet. There’s still one more card we can play.” General Javel picked up his arctech radio, tuning the frequency to a separate channel. “Sebastian, I know you’re listening on this channel.”</p><p>[Always astute as ever, Javel, but it seems that you have been exposed.] Sebastian chuckled.</p><p>“Are you willing to help us?”</p><p>[And why would I do that?]</p><p>“Don’t play dumb with me. I know that while you’ve been helping us fight against the Red Lions and Wretches, you’ve also been supplying them at the same time. You want this protracted war. With the Seven Snakes tipping the battlefield, your three-way war may be gone.”</p><p>[Hmm… An interesting proposition. I will send you an elite squad, one of our very best. They will arrive at the headquarters within an hour.]</p><p>“Thank you.” General Javel ended the conversation, smirking to himself. “Alejandro, relay defensive orders to all units. Distribute all remaining military equipment to whoever is left. We’ll plunge this area into chaos and make them regret attacking us. With the support of the Ardent Cretins, we may be able to negotiate a ceasefire after a week of fighting.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>The Ilysian Punks quickly reformed their defenses, preparing for the inevitable counterattack from all sides. The repeater carbines, military armor, and mortars were given out like candy, arming the entire force. </p><p>Soon, the elite squad of the Ardent Cretins arrived, decked from head to toe in engraved knight armor and wielding heavy polearms. Each of them had three arcite fuel packs embedded within the armor, fueling its exorbitant energy consumption. While their overall speed was extremely slow, they could take an enormous amount of punishment and still come out on top. </p><p>“Good! Very good!” General Javel nodded happily. “We will have you fight against the Red Lions directly, as they pose the largest threat now. Alejandro, you will—” </p><p>Before General Javel could complete the sentence, the closest Ardent Cretins thug reached out and grabbed Javel by the neck while the rest surrounded him and quickly restrained him. “WHAT? What is the meaning of this? Alejandro, stop them!”</p><p>Javel’s eyes landed on Alejandro, who did not react at all and stood quietly at the side. Realization dawned on him, a scowling expression forming on his face. “ALEJANDRO, HOW DARE YOU!”</p><p>“Under the authority of Baron Cain, I hereby arrest you for treason and espionage against the Yual Dominion; illegal smuggling of guns to foreign powers and the formation of secret societies; and consistent flouting of the prohibition bans. How do you plead?”</p><p>“FUCK YOU, ALEJANDRO!”</p><p>“General Javel, you’re too fixated on your Versian heritage. Why help a homeland that has no gratitude for you? I will not die for a home I have not stepped foot in for twenty years.”</p><p>“TRAITOR! Mark my words, once I get out, you and your descendants will suffer! Not even the Grand Waves will save you!” General Javel yelled as he thrashed on the floor before one of the Ardent Cretins delivered a strong punch to his face, knocking him out cold. </p><p>“That’s if they even let you go. Take him away and hand him over to the Magda. Bishop Vernette will be pleased.” Alejandro smirked as two Ardent Cretins hauled him away. </p><p>[Good work, Alejandro.] Sebastian’s voice wafted over the arctech radio. </p><p>“Don’t forget your promise,” Alejandro warned. </p><p>[Of course, you will get your position among the Ardent Cretins. However, there is still one more part to the deal.]</p><p>Alejandro nodded, walking across the room toward an inconspicuous bookshelf. He ran his hands over the bookshelf, feeling the grooves between the books and ultimately stopping at a yellow-painted leather cover. </p><p>With a single twist, the bookshelf rumbled as it swung open to reveal a hidden elevator leading to a basement deep beneath the ground. Alejandro and two Ardent Cretins members entered the elevator, which rumbled as it descended more than five floors underground. </p><p>The elevator door swung open to reveal a large storage cavern with countless crates stacked up along its walls. “This is everything the Ilysian Punks have hoarded over the last three years. Guns, potions, gold. This is the main stash. The main entrance is in the West Sector, while the exit is beyond the city walls. “</p><p>The two knights inspected the crates, noticing there was far more military technology here than just the shipment that had gone missing. It seemed that the Ilysian Punks had actually been doing this for years rather than just recently.</p><p>[Ah, so that’s why the shipment of guns went past the Seven Snakes district.]</p><p>“It is easier to throw the enforcers off our trails by planting the entrance far away from our area.”</p><p>[And the exit?]</p><p>Alejandro led the two Ardent Cretins thugs to the far end of the cavern, where the rushing sound of water could be heard.</p><p>“An underground river that leads to a cave in a nearby forest, from which couriers can easily pick it up and smuggle them into Versia. The transport route works both ways.”</p><p>[Brilliant, Alejandro. You will be rewarded.]</p><p>As soon as Sebastian said that, the two Ardent Cretins members grabbed Alejandro, restraining him from behind. Shocked, Alejandro struggled against the metallic armored arms that locked his limbs. “I followed your orders to the letter and even gave you the stash! What the fuck more do you want?”</p><p>[The Ardent Cretins have no place for traitors like you, Alejandro. Cut him up and dump the body in the river. I'll be there shortly]</p><p>Chapter 44: Aftermath</p><p>Kyle grabbed the head of yet another Ilysian Punks and punched it hard, his fist cratering the punk’s face in. While he had managed to clear out the Ilysian Punks from the Seven Snakes district, he was slightly surprised as to how easy the counterattack was the following day after the initial assault. </p><p>Damian, too, was slightly wary, afraid of an imminent counterattack. However, the Ilysian Punks’ entire top hierarchy seemed to have crumbled in an instant. “Do you think it was the inquisitors that helped us?”</p><p>Kyle did not see Kitana in action but had already heard from Damian about how she killed the second wave of Ilysian Punks, effectively saving the Seven Snakes. The description of how Kitana restrained the punks threw alarm bells into Kyle’s mind. <em>Unique arctech equipment? Or another system user?</em></p><p>He was not that arrogant to believe he was the only system user in the world—there was a good chance that Kitana was one too, but he did not have evidence, especially since he had yet to meet another system user. </p><p>Whatever the reason for the inquisitors’ help was, he was now able to preserve most of his forces and get them back into fighting condition the very next day, enabling them to fight for control over the adjacent districts owned by the Ilysian Punks. </p><p>The Ilysian Punks tried to reorganize and fight back, but with their command hierarchy in shambles, they fell like dominoes. </p><p>It was now a mad race against time, with the Seven Snakes, Red Lions, and the Wretches trying to cut up the districts owned by the Ilysian Punks. </p><p>“Clear out this pub and move onto the next block. We need to reach the other district before the Red Lions get there.”</p><p>Kyle had the Seven Snakes split up into different squads, conquering and staking their claim on each urban block in sequence. The residents were slightly alarmed by the fighting, but the rival gangs only targeted each other as long as they stayed out of the way. </p><p>The enforcers were also going in at full force, raiding the main base of the Ilysian Punks. By the time night fell for a second time, the conflict was over as abruptly as it had begun. <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Kyle walked through the new district the next day, with the place springing back into life. No longer did the residents cower in fear, heading back to work as though nothing had changed. For those who had lived in Raktor long enough, such gang conflicts were as common as the change in seasons. It did not matter to them who was in charge of them, as long as they could carry on with their ordinary lives. </p><p>“Keith, set up the same events we did for our previous district. We have to build some goodwill in the new district to properly assimilate it into us,” Kyle ordered Keith, who was walking behind him and taking notes of the damage to some of the businesses. </p><p>They inspected one of the Ilysian Punks’ former pubs. The bar and tables had been smashed to smithereens by the brawl. A few Seven Snakes associates were already inside, cleaning up and hauling the dead bodies outside. Keith noted that a few of the employees were dead, sighing as he saw two associates haul a dead bartender out. “It’s going to take two hundred thousand rakels to fix up this mess, and then we need to hire more people to replace them.”</p><p>“How much cash do we have left?”</p><p>“After repaying the Crimson Swords, producing the arctech equipment, funding your pet railgun, and building custom explosive liquid for a mortar? About four hundred thousand left. Do you have another exotic handgun to auction, by any chance?” Keith sighed.</p><p>“You know the value will be deprecated.”</p><p>“Then you’d better hope the Violet Demons don’t try to attack the goblin den anytime soon. With both you and Sasha gone, our defenses there are sorely lacking.”</p><p>“We’ll gather more recruits to defend that area,” Kyle replied, stepping out of the damaged pub and back onto the street. </p><p>In the distance, he could see plenty of freshly recruited Seven Snakes associates cleaning up the streets of debris and broken weapons. Wagons of dead Ilysian Punks members were carted off, to be dumped unceremoniously in the mass graves far beyond the city’s walls. </p><p>Alex was one of the newly recruited Seven Snakes associates, staring at some of the tied-up punks who had surrendered. If it were him from two days ago, he would have personally taken a knife and cut all of their heads off one by one. However, he had long lost the burning desire for revenge, now only torn with despair at what had happened to his wife. </p><p>While he was lost in his depression, staring blankly at the ground, a hand tapped his shoulder frantically. “Alex, Alex. ALEX! Stand up straight. The boss is here!”</p><p>Alex jolted back to reality, straightening his back as the new recruits lined up straight. Kyle walked past them, inspecting each of them from head to toe.</p><p>Many of them were residents of the Seven Snakes district, caught up in the war. Some joined for fame and money, others joined for protection, but the vast majority were driven by hatred and a desire for revenge. Alex was one of them. </p><p>“Under the laws imposed by the Sanctum of Yual, murder is unacceptable. In normal circumstances, you would have immediately been arrested by the enforcers and hauled away to prison, potentially enslaved to mine arcite ore in Tryas. However, as long as you listen to me and follow my orders, this fate shall never befall you,” Kyle said as he walked slowly, his voice as clear as day.</p><p>“Know this: once you join the Seven Snakes, there is no turning back. If you wish to retract your membership, do so now. Walk away and live a normal life.”</p><p>However, no one budged, all standing straight and firm. Alex, too, did not budge, despite having lost the original reason why he had fought back against the Ilysian Punks in the first place. His two daughters were counting on him to survive, and with his house in ruins, he needed all the extra money he could get. </p><p>Many of the other fresh recruits were of the same mindset. With their homes and lifestyles now in ruins, it was unimaginable how long they would have to toil away as a construction worker, a chef, or a factory worker to make back what they originally had. Being under the Seven Snakes was a different story altogether—fame and fortune came easily as long as you were a part of it. </p><p>None of them were frightened by pain any longer, having fought side by side against the Ilysian Punks to defend their families. </p><p>“Good, then you are now all associates of the Seven Snakes. Work hard, and you will receive your due reward in equal amounts. Carry on.” Kyle dismissed them, letting them resume their work. </p><p>Kyle continued through the two districts that they captured, repeating the same speech to different groups of fresh recruits. What the recruits did not know was that he had deliberately delayed the response time of the Seven Snakes to the attacks of the Ilysian Punks in order to create more chaos and drive up the desperation of the people. He needed more tragedies to happen to break the normal lifestyle of the citizens, making them flock toward him for security. <em>Just like a protection racket.</em></p><p>And unsurprisingly, it worked like a charm. The Seven Snakes now had more than fifty fresh recruits, doubling their numbers in just a short three days. More work would have to be done over the next few days to integrate them into the gang properly, but for now, Kyle was happy with how the gang was growing. <em>We will need to make the gang more hierarchical to prevent leaks and betrayals. I must add another intermediate rank, perhaps “cobra”?</em></p><p>He soon came across Damian, who was helping give out food to those affected by the conflict and setting up a soup kitchen similar to the one they had established before. </p><p>More than a hundred residents were gathered, covered in a haphazard mess of clothing to protect them from the environment, as their hands shakily accepted the bowls of soup. Damian smiled as he gave out each bowl, trying to make small talk with the residents. </p><p>From behind Damian, a young man eyed him and the Seven Snakes emblem on his shoulder angrily, retrieving a knife from his pocket and slowly closing the gap from behind, planning to stab him in the back. </p><p>As the young man lunged without a word, the knife stabbed into the flesh and caused Damian to scream. However, the blade did not push as far as the young man would have hoped. Immediately, two of the Seven Snakes associates grabbed the young man, pinning him down on the ground. </p><p>“FUCK YOU SEVEN SNAKES! YOU KILLED MY FATHER!” the young man roared in anger as he thrashed on the ground, fighting against the associates. He used his mouth to bite deep into the arm of an associate, forcing the arm to let go of him as he tried to scamper away.</p><p>Instead, he ran headfirst into Kyle, knocking into his leg and bouncing backward. “YOU! I’LL KILL YOU!” The young man recognized Kyle as the leader of the Seven Snakes, throwing a punch. Kyle dodged the attack, causing the young man to stumble forward and trip onto the floor. </p><p>“This weak, and you want to avenge your father? Pathetic.” Kyle motioned for the two associates to grab him. “Drag him out.”</p><p>The young man was dragged out to the front of the soup kitchen stall, kicking and screaming while Damian pulled the knife out of his back. “Fellow residents. We are working hard to clean up and provide you with new housing as well as food,” Kyle said to the crowd of residents as he walked behind the young man.</p><p>“But you all seem to not be too cooperative, so let me make this clear.” </p><p>Kyle grabbed the arctech handgun out of his suit’s inner holster and aimed it at the back of the young man’s head, pulling the trigger. The brains and flesh were splattered in a spray onto the floor, coating the ground with blood and gore. A few of the residents shrieked in panic, but many were simply frightened and rooted to the ground. </p><p>“Anyone—ANYONE!—who tries to go against me and hurt my people, you now know what’s coming. THE SEVEN SNAKES RULES THIS PLACE NOW!” </p><p>The young man’s body was dropped onto the ground, limp, as his head lolled to the side. “Clean this up,” Kyle ordered the two associates as he adjusted his suit, putting the handgun back in its holster. </p><p>Damian nodded, unfazed by how Kyle had reacted. He had long known that Kyle would fully retaliate against anyone who tried to go against him or hurt the Seven Snakes. He felt a bit of sympathy for the young man, but he also felt an increase in loyalty, knowing that Kyle was willing to go that far to get revenge for him. </p><p>Kyle continued walking down the street, meeting up with Keith again. “Did you see the enforcers?” Kyle asked.</p><p>“No, why? Are we not in a temporary alliance?”</p><p>As soon as he asked, three arctech wagons turned the corner and drove toward them, bearing the insignia of the enforcers and the Sanctum of Yual. The wagons came to a halt right in front of Kyle, with fifteen armored enforcers jumping out and surrounding him, aiming their rifles at him. </p><p>Mason stepped out of the first wagon, smoking a pipe as he grinned at Kyle. “Alvin Tersa. Under the powers vested in me by the Inquisition of the Sanctum of Yual, you’re under arrest.”</p><p>Chapter 45: Trump Card</p><p>Bishop Vernette frowned as she read through the reports over the last few days. </p><p>While the raid on the Ilysian Punks had been going on, someone had been disseminating cheap repeater handguns much like the one sold in the auction, prompting countless small-time criminals to buy them. </p><p>Baron Cain could not control the flow of handguns, leading to an increased crime rate across the South Sector, with thugs now using the handguns to threaten and raid shops and businesses. The gun situation was completely getting out of hand. More and more enforcers were being injured in the line of duty. </p><p>At this rate, Bishop Vernette could tell that the baron was losing his patience. One wrong misstep, and the bishop could say goodbye to her current well-paid position. </p><p>The doors to her office burst open as Mason escorted Kyle in.</p><p>“Sorry for the rough handling,” Bishop Vernette apologized as Mason uncuffed Kyle in the bishop’s office. “We had to show we were doing something.”</p><p>Kyle didn’t seem fazed by the handcuffs, nor did his skin show any sign of pain or soreness. Kitana stood by the side, eyeing Kyle carefully. </p><p>“I assume you have something you need me to do.” Kyle did not beat around the bush, getting straight to the point. </p><p>“Where are the remaining guns?” Mason asked. </p><p>“Remaining guns? I handed over every single crate I’ve found in the Ilysian Punks territory.”</p><p>“Don’t fuck with us. We know exactly how many crates have gone missing. And all of a sudden, your members appear with handguns that look exactly like the one sold in the Central Sector’s auction house. The exact same ones are showing up all over the black market. Every fucking second-rate thug will have one by the next year.”</p><p>“And just like those second-hand thugs, I needed everything I could get my hands on to win. The black market sells a lot of things—I’m sure you know that better than I do.”</p><p>“I’m assuming it’s the same for the mortars, then.”</p><p>“How observant.”</p><p>“Alvin.” Mason straightened his coat. “I’m not going to ask again. Where. Are. The. Remaining. Guns?”</p><p>Kyle looked Mason in the eye, unflinching. “I don’t know. They are most certainly not in my territory.”</p><p>“And you expect me to believe that? It seems you got the biggest haul out of this entire fiasco. I’m even inclined to believe that you instigated the Ilysian Punks to steal from the factory in the first place!”</p><p>“An unfounded accusation.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that. Maybe a few weeks in prison will help you talk.”</p><p>Kyle did not reply, showing no expression on his face whatsoever, causing Mason to get even more visibly frustrated.</p><p>Mason ordered two enforcers to come in and drag him out to a holding cell. Kyle shrugged their hands off, walking by himself. </p><p>As the doors closed behind Kyle, Mason sighed, looking at Kitana and Bishop Vernette. “Well? What do the two of you think?”</p><p>Kitana shrugged her shoulders. Her skill, Eyes of Truth,<em> </em>could see through optical illusions and such but could not make out if someone was lying or not. <em>Maybe when I hit my next class upgrade, I’ll get Ears of Truth or something of the sort.</em></p><p>Bishop Vernette was equally hesitant. “I don’t think he is the one holding on to the remaining crates. We’re still missing ten crates, and even if he’s lying, he will only have one crate at most. Holding that many is a veritable death sentence for such a small gang as his.”</p><p>“I’ll wait for our enforcers to report back before making a final call.” Mason crossed his arms, plopping down onto the sofa. Two minutes passed in silence while the bishop continued to read reports of increasing gun violence.</p><p>Soon, an enforcer entered the office, bowing to the inquisitors and the bishop. “Sir, we’ve checked the entire Seven Snakes district and found no traces of any guns.”</p><p>Mason stood up in shock. “Not even a single crate? Gun barrels? Bullet tests? Firing ranges?”</p><p>“Nothing, sir. All we found was some evidence of a factory manufacturing a few arctech armor pieces, but nothing related to guns.”</p><p>“He’s hiding them; I know he is!” Mason slammed his fist on the holster of the sofa. </p><p>“Uhh, sir? There’s one more thing.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“There’s a protest going out now right outside the Magda. It seems to be comprised of the local residents, calling for Kyle’s release.”</p><p>“Who the fuck is riling them up?!” Mason gritted his teeth in anger, but he already knew the answer deep down. <em>Of course, it’s the Seven Snakes members!</em></p><p>The bishop walked up to the window of her office, overlooking the protesting crowd who held signs and arctech loudhailers shouting out. </p><p>“JUSTICE FOR KYLE!”</p><p>“RELEASE OUR PROTECTOR!”</p><p>“You!” Mason pointed at the enforcer. “Gather ten of your men and clear them out!”</p><p>“Belay that order,” Bishop Vernette interrupted. “Release Alvin now.”</p><p>“But if he’s hiding the guns…”</p><p>“Then we will catch him in the act there and then. It is not worth going against public opinion right now. They see the Seven Snakes as their protectors and defenders.”</p><p>“You know it’s the Seven Snakes members that are fueling the crowd. No doubt they bribed or hired a few civilians and squatters to form a protest. I don’t believe—”</p><p>Bishop Vernette rubbed the bridge of her nose, her face fatigued. “Understand this, Mason. You may have a job to do, but I have a position to protect. I will not let you jeopardize my authority over this South Sector.”</p><p>“You giving up Kyle to them shows a lack of authority instead!” Mason countered.</p><p>“It is only a matter of time before public opinion begins to swing against Kyle once again. Soon, they will see the Seven Snakes for what they are—what every gang is—an organization dedicated to fleecing as much cash from them as possible. It is at that time that we strike. Furthermore, the longer we hold Kyle, the more public opinion will turn against us. Would you like for reporters to publish our faces in newspapers in Tryas?”</p><p>Mason finally understood the angle the bishop was aiming for. “I understand. But I still think—”</p><p>The arctech phone line on the bishop’s desk rang, prompting the woman to pick it up. A moment of hesitation reigned in the air, the bishop listening intently as relief washed over her face. “Yes, sir. I understand. I will have him released right away.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Kyle was hauled out of the holding cell, uncuffed for the second time today, by Mason, who had a sour expression. “It looks like things are not turning out the way you expected them too,” Kyle said.</p><p>“Don’t think you’re scot-free. I’m always watching you. The moment you slip up, you can forget about life outside the arcite mines,” Mason threatened.</p><p>“A word of advice from me then—perhaps you should consider if the other gangs had a part to play? I heard rumors that the Ilysian Punks were uncharacteristically poor or lacking in wealth when their main base was cracked open. But what do I know? I never made it that far in—I’m sure you can verify that with your observers.” Kyle smirked. </p><p>Mason didn’t reply, merely cursing under his breath as he dragged Kyle out toward the entrance of the Magda Chapel. </p><p>As he stepped out into the daylight, the crowd cheered and roared as they saw him emerge. For some unknown reason, a red carpet was laid out right through the middle of the crowd at the base of the marble steps, along with a smiling noble standing right in front of him.</p><p>“Ah, the man of the hour! Savior of the South Sector! I am truly sorry for the mistake I made. How could we ever arrest a model citizen of the Yual Dominion?” Baron Cain grinned widely as he patted Kyle’s back, waving at the crowd and smiling at all the reporters who turned up to cover the protests. </p><p><em>Another showman. </em>Kyle decided to play along, bowing to Baron Cain. “Thank you for your kind words, Baron Cain.”</p><p>“Please allow me to reward you. I would like to invite you to my dwelling.”</p><p>“Of course, I am grateful for the invitation.”</p><p>They entered the baron’s personal arctech wagon with the luxury turned up to eleven. Kyle, however, was obviously not impressed, having experienced far more in the Galactic Era. His expression remained calm, not flustered nor tempted by the wealth on display around him. </p><p>Baron Cain smiled and gave a final wave to the crowd as the wagon departed, before sitting down opposite Kyle. Without a word, Cain slowly pulled out the “Oriental Bloom” handgun from his suit, resting it on his lap. </p><p>“You don’t seem surprised by this sequence of events.”</p><p>“I’ve been told that I need to work on my expressions.”</p><p>“And you don’t seem flustered at all by this handgun.”</p><p>“Should I be?”</p><p>“Who sold you the other prototype handguns?”</p><p>“The black market has everything, Baron. If you would like, I could recommend a dealer to you, though I’m sure you know every dealer there is in the South Sector already.”</p><p>“You’re the one who sold this handgun in the auction house, didn’t you?”</p><p>“What auction?”</p><p>“Don’t play dumb with me, Mr. Tersa. I have my own information network. Do not take me for a fool. If I wanted to, I could have you locked away in a slammer or slave-mining for the rest of your life.”</p><p>“If you’re willing to take a hit to your reputation, that is. Does the lord of the city, Count Leon, know that the guns are proliferating in the South Sector? I recently heard gun violence is on the rise. Not a very good look for a baron barely five years into the role.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?”</p><p>“I’m only laying out a scenario. I’m not a criminal, Baron Cain. I simply run an organization aimed at generating the most profit through various means.” Kyle leaned back into the chair. “Now you have a problem, and I offer a solution.”</p><p>Baron Cain didn’t reply, prompting Kyle to continue. “Guns of a certain nature have begun to proliferate on the black market, allowing normal thugs to purchase and use them. In fact, almost any normal human can use them, not requiring an arcite fuel pack. Sure, they can only get off a few shots, but that’s enough to perform a mass shooting if they wanted to.”</p><p>“Get to the point.”</p><p>Kyle smiled, knowing he had hooked the baron. “I have a way to disable all existing handguns on the black market. But in the event I am imprisoned or killed for any reason, existing orders with my subordinates both inside the city and outside will distribute even more guns into the city. And I’m sure that wouldn’t put you in a very good light with Count Leon.”</p><p>Baron Cain stiffened up, thinking about the repercussions. He was indeed planning to imprison Kyle, which was why he had performed the entire publicity stunt in the first place. </p><p>With that, he could make an excuse that Kyle was staying at his place as an honored guest, preventing his subordinates from throwing a fit. He stared at Kyle’s face, noticing that Kyle seemed to have been expecting this. </p><p>Baron Cain quickly thought through all the possible scenarios. Killing him would set off a chain of events he did not want to deal with. With handguns in full proliferation now, it would be impossible for him to mobilize the enforcers to crack down on every single thug who had one. He had no idea how many handguns Kyle had distributed onto the black market.</p><p>“If I accept your solution, you must cease all gun distribution immediately.”</p><p>“Of course. Peace in our time. However, the orders I gave my subordinate still stand.”</p><p>“How does your solution work?”</p><p>“You will see it in action tonight, but time is ticking. If I don’t return to the Seven Snakes district by the next three hours, I’m afraid that even <em>I </em>won’t be able to stop it.”</p><p>“So if you don’t stop it within a day…”</p><p>“Then feel free to imprison or kill me. It wouldn’t matter at that point after all.”</p><p>“Fine.” Baron Cain ordered the driver to turn around and drive the wagon back to the Seven Snakes’ district. </p><p>The wagon soon reached the district, and Kyle stepped off onto the street. “A final piece of advice. Keep your handgun in a thick metal safe if possible.”</p><p>Baron Cain was stunned by the sudden advice, but Kyle was already walking off, while a reporter nearby began to observe the baron. “Get us back to the mansion right now!” Baron Cain urged.</p><p>Kyle entered the former Seven Snakes base, where the vipers—Sasha, Damian, and Keith—were waiting for him. “Sasha, set up the large arctech radio with Gordon in the room.”</p><p>[Yes, sir, already on it.]</p><p>“Good. Whoever still has their handguns, place them here on the table.”</p><p>Niko was confused but still complied with the order. “Why? What’s going to happen? Is this a ceremony?”</p><p>“A show of force.”</p><p>As soon as the large arctech radio was set up, Kyle activated it and tweaked the interior engravings into a different position. Instead of speaking into it, Kyle took an engraved metal plate and slotted it in, modifying the arctech radio. </p><p>No one felt anything, but the handguns began to glow red hot from the inside, a sizzling cracking sound instead emitting from the interior. </p><p>Damian was the first one to comprehend what was happening immediately, his face breaking out into a wide grin. “Holy shit, you’re self-destructing all the handguns in the city! HAHA! Imagine the baron’s face right now!”</p><p>Niko nodded but was still a bit confused. “Wait, but does this mean we lose our handguns as well?” He pointed at the melting handguns.</p><p>Kyle chuckled slightly for the first time. “This is simply to show the baron and the enforcers that we destroyed our handguns as well. But this isn’t the only set of handguns we have, remember? Time to expand.”</p><p>Chapter 46: Innovation</p><p><em>A month after the fall of the Ilysian Punks…</em></p><p>“So I just have to stand here?” A little girl with pigtails glanced around the room, while a large arctech device was aimed right at her, four black lenses staring her down. </p><p>If she did not know any better, she would have assumed it was a monster of sorts, but she had complete faith in the man behind the machine, who was currently modifying its innards with a hot pointed iron serving as an etcher, changing some of the arctech engravings on the fly. </p><p>“Yes, dear, just stay right there. Papa’s going to show you a miraculous invention!”</p><p>“Like the dragonfly you showed me?”</p><p>The father stuck his head out and grinned at the girl. “Even better. Just give me a minute.” </p><p>He focused back on the interior again, mumbling to himself as he carefully rerouted some of the arctech engravings. “Just have to add a few more traces here to reduce the high-speed load of the incoming light… FUCK!” He yelped as the hot iron accidentally touched one of his fingertips, making him almost drop it and wreck the rest of the machine. The hot iron, however, scratched the surface of an engraving, rendering it completely useless.</p><p>“No, no, no!” The father groaned as he noticed the error, trying to take subsequent deep breaths to calm himself down. <em>Stay calm, Reese. This is your big breakout moment; stay calm. We still got a few days to sort this out. </em></p><p>“Daddy, how long do I have to stand? I’m tired…” The little girl whined as she shuffled uncomfortably, her eyes already locked onto the sofa nearby. </p><p>“Sorry, dear, it’s going to be a while more. Let’s take a break.” Reese smiled weakly, turning off the arctech etcher and stepping back. The room was a mess of metal and engravings, save for the sofa, where the little girl rolled around happily. </p><p>Reese shambled over to a workbench filled with broken engraving plates and tools scattered in an unruly fashion. “Need to find a replacement… It’s better if I did the modifications here…”</p><p>He pulled a wooden stool up to the table to sit, rubbing his deep black eyebags that had never gone away since he had begun this project. It had been nearly a month, and had been nothing short of a miraculous run. </p><p>His arm instinctively reached out to the right, attempting to grab something as he stared at the engraving in front of him. The observant little girl quickly jumped to her feet and ran out of the room, but soon returned with a shocked face. “Papa, we’re out of potions!”</p><p>“What?! We’re out of Stamina Potions?!” Reese’s face balked, but he took yet another deep breath. “It’s okay, darling. I don’t need the potions to get this done. Only one more final stretch to go.”</p><p>That final stretch turned into hours, with the little girl having gone to sleep in her own room while Reese toiled through the night. His body felt lethargic, his arms weak, and his thighs aching from the numerous nights he had spent trying to make this thing perfect. </p><p>Just as soon as he was about to give up and turn in for the night, the doorbell rang softly, ringing like a charm. Reese’s face immediately lit up, and he scampered to the door, frantically opening it to reveal a well-dressed gentleman in a black coat. </p><p>“Hello, Reese. I’ve come to check up on the progress of your project.”</p><p>“Sir Kyle, thank goodness you’re here! I’m currently trying to fix a few issues here, and I may require your help once again.”</p><p>“Of course.” Kyle smiled genially before motioning to an associate behind him carrying a crate of Stamina Potions. “You, put it in the kitchen and wait for me outside.”</p><p>The associate nodded, with Reese making way for the two of them to enter the house. The man quickly led Kyle into the workshop, explaining the issue with the engraving. “The main problem I’m facing right now is that there seems to be residual energy being emitted from the machine toward the lens. From my understanding, the entire device should be completely passive.”</p><p>“Let me have a look.” Kyle sat on another wooden stool and examined the engraving in question. “Bring over the schematic diagrams.”</p><p>Reese pulled out an entire stack of papers, each detailing a specific part of the machine and its connections. Kyle flipped through each page, tracing the error through its various supposed connections. “I found the error. You have the engraving connected to these wrong four ports, causing the engraving to be connected and form a radiative effect.”</p><p>“Radiative…?”</p><p>“Never mind. The point is, you’ll have to redo a few parts in the machine. Can you make it for the demonstration debut?”</p><p>“I….” Reese was about to say yes, but he checked the number of modifications he would have to make, which would be more than he could do in the next two days. He could barely keep himself awake, even in front of his biggest investor in the project yet. </p><p>“Okay. I’ll get the factory to manufacture the parts for you right away. I will be back in the morning. You should get good rest. Don’t want you messing up the demonstration.”</p><p>“Th-Thank you, sir!” Reese stood up and bowed deeply, his face filled with gratitude. He would never forget how hard and long he had fought at the University of Raktor to get this project done, only to find Kyle as an investor the moment he went out drinking and crying in a pub. He also owed him his life for saving him from a pub brawl in which he was nearly killed.</p><p>This project would truly be his big breakthrough. Kyle had already signed a contract to co-found a company that could commercialize the product if the demonstration was successful. He could already imagine his face and name plastered across the billboards of the city, along with the company logo. <em>I’ll be rich and successful!</em></p><p>However, he was still a bit suspicious of Kyle. It was natural. They were going to be co-owners of the new company, after all. <em>I don’t know if Kyle has something unique planned.</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The university’s theater was not particularly crowded for the demonstration debut, with only a few other faculty professors and merchants yawning in the front row seats. However, the turnout was still more than anything Reese could have expected. He peeked his head out from the backstage area through the stage curtains, spotting the dean of the university sitting there as well. </p><p><em>Hah, you old fucker. You did not even give me the time of day when I started!</em> Reese gripped his fist tightly as he recalled that humiliating moment, the lowest point of his career as a university professor. He knew the dean would most likely be the first to pounce on the successful demonstration. </p><p>On a viewing box near the top, Kyle looked expectantly down on the stage, supporting Reese. </p><p>The lights of the theater began to dim slowly, all eyes now focused on the brightly lit wooden stage. Reese rolled the arctech machine out, which looked like a rectangular box-shaped device half the size of a human with four black lenses jutting out conspicuously. </p><p>Reese cleared his throat and faced the audience, his white hair now slickly combed down and his clothes cleaned—though his deep eyebags remained a testament to the work he had put in. “Fellow professors, potential investors, and other viewers such as my students, today I am proud to reveal an invention that will revolutionize the way media is used to enrich our lives.”</p><p>“For generations, we have relied on paintings and scribbling on parchment to convey images, memories, and meanings through the generations. This machine here represents a complete overhaul of this limitation, allowing us to store our most precious moments in the form of paper.”</p><p>A theater employee suddenly ran up to the dean in the front row, whispering urgently into his ears. Within seconds, the dean stood right up, quickly following the employee out of the theater. It did not matter to Reese, who was more than happy to see the old geezer gone. </p><p>“I present to you—the light-capturer!”</p><p>Kyle internally winced at the name but did not show any outburst of emotion or groan. It was a different world that he was in now—he could hardly expect the name to be the same. Also, if he did use or convinced Reese to use the name “camera,” “holo-recorder,” or the countless Galactic Era–branded names, it might give him away to those in the know.</p><p>With the existence of the Ancient Exosuit Spine as well as the energy shield wielded by Makoa, which was now in his possession, he was acutely aware that there was more to the world than a simple “reincarnation.” </p><p>“The light-capturer does what its namesake does. Capture light. The prevailing theory of our world is that we see things through reflected rays of light, and as such, the device is a reimagining of current optical magnification engravings, instead routing the information captured and putting them onto paper. An example is now being distributed by the assistants.”</p><p>A few pieces of paper were distributed around, with a photo of Reese’s daughter on it. Many of the audience members gasped at the detail, though Kyle was hardly impressed. In his view, it was the most pixelated holo-image he had ever seen. </p><p>“That’s right; this is not a painting, nor was it mass-produced by a printing press. This is a lightprint of a scene! And today—”</p><p>The doors to the theater suddenly banged wide open, with ten thugs entering the theater. Reese was taken aback by the sudden entrance, while the audience members were all confused. Squinting his eyes and looking at the leader of the thugs, an expression of recognition began to dawn on his face. “Yo… You! You were at the pub!”</p><p>“So were you, pretty boy. Big day for you, huh? Think you can get into a fight with me at the pub and get away scot-free?!” The leader of the thugs grinned as he twirled a crowbar, strutting down the aisles while his fellow thug members spread out among the audience, watching them closely. </p><p>“I was drunk then! I already apologized!” Reese exclaimed. “Please don’t do this, I swear I’ll repay you next time for any grievances I may have caused you.” </p><p>The leader hopped up onto the wooden stage, eyeing the light-capturer. “Nice toy you’ve got here. Would be a shame if it was smashed into pieces!” The leader brandished the crowbar, smashing the very future and dream that Reese had been focused on for every waking hour of his life in the past month. </p><p>As the metal parts were dented and the lens was shattered into tiny, brilliant black pieces, Reese instinctively roared and lunged forward in a desperate bid to protect the machine. However, the leader immediately swung the crowbar at him, hitting Reese right in the head and knocking him out. </p><p>“GUARDS!” an audience member shrieked before she too was hit over the head by a metal pipe by one of the thugs. </p><p>The leader kicked the unconscious Reese, flipping his body over. “Oh, don’t think passing out is the worst I can do to you. BOYS! Grab the body and machine out of here!”</p><p>“Ya, bosmang.” The thugs complied, with two hoisting the body up and two picking up the valuable parts of the machine.  As soon as the door closed behind the leaving thug group, the entire audience broke into a frenzy, running all over the place. </p><p>“Professor Reese got kidnapped! Call the dean and the enforcers, quick!”</p><p>“Where did the dean go? Where are the university guards?!”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Reese woke up groggily, noticing his head was still pounding with liquid dripping down his forehead—no, it was blood, his own blood. </p><p>Jolting awake, the sudden movement had him fall over backward in the chair that he was tied to, crashing onto the bare, concrete floor with a resounding crash. The glass windows that pockmarked the ceiling shone brightly into his eyes, causing him to wince.</p><p>“Look, the cunt is awake.” The leader smirked as he stood up from the barrel he was sitting on, striding over with his crowbar. </p><p>“Wh-Why are you doing this?” Reese asked weakly, the blood loss and the impact still making him dizzy and unable to get a good grasp on where he was. </p><p>The leader squatted next to Reese and grabbed his face. “The same reason why everyone in Raktor does something—money. And you look like a hundred thousand rakels to me now.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“That’s right. Someone put a contract on you! Do you really think that I, the great Tyler fucking Won, would barge into a university and risk getting caught by the enforcers just so I could fuck you up for a pub brawl a month ago? HAH!”</p><p>If the thumping in Reese’s head was not already bad enough, it got even worse with this realization. <em>Who paid the thug gang to kidnap me? Was it my jealous colleagues? The dean?!</em></p><p>Soon, a man dressed in inconspicuous attire entered the warehouse, clearly of a different class than the leader of the thugs. “Good job catching him.” </p><p>“So you’re the client. Fuck that, where’s the money? I don’t want to mess with Kyle any longer if necessary.”</p><p>“Not until I ask the hostage some questions.” The client adjusted his collar, walking up to Reese, who looked petrified. He did not recognize the person at all, but he began to put two and two together quickly. <em>Shit, he’s here to steal the technology from me!</em></p><p>The leader groaned loudly. “Fuck, are you serious? Fine, have it your way. But fifteen minutes more, and we’re out of here.”</p><p>Before the client could retort, a series of screams and cries echoed through the empty warehouse, prompting the remaining thugs to stand up, their faces wary. </p><p>“Who the fuck is that?” The leader dropped Reese back onto the floor, walking up to the main warehouse entrance, where the sounds of fighting could be heard. </p><p>An injured thug staggered to the door, limping toward the leader. “Who is attacking us?!”</p><p>“It’s him! The Seven Snak—” Before the thug could finish, his head was crushed in by a neon red arctech hammer, breaking through the skull in a smooth downward motion. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Thug”</p><p></p><p>Reese gaped in shock, having never seen an actual fight break out before. It looked like an entire movie scene to him as the wielder of the hammer charged forward, smacking each of the thugs with a single hit and killing them. Even the leader of the thugs stood no chance against Kyle’s strength.</p><p>“Wh-What!? Kyle!?” the client exclaimed, running over to Reese and grabbing him to use as a hostage shield. Within a minute, Kyle had killed all the thug members in sequence, as though it were a choreographed fight scene. Reese was naturally happy. <em>He came to save me!</em></p><p>“Stay back! Otherwise, I kill him!” The client began to sweat profusely, his eyes glancing back and forth, looking for a way out. The tip of the crowbar pierced Reese’s skin, drawing blood.</p><p>Kyle stopped moving. </p><p>“Good. Now we can make a deal. You don’t want your precious Reese here getting hurt, do you? Don’t try anything funny.” The client tried to understand what was happening. <em>How did Kyle get here so fast? Was he tracking the thugs? I should have shifted the hostage immediately.</em></p><p>“Oh, I won’t. But I can’t say the same for her,” Kyle replied.</p><p>“Her?”</p><p>The glass windows in the ceilings were shattered, with a female figure landing right behind the client as they were showered in glass shards. In one swift motion, the lady grabbed the neck of the client and pinned him to the ground. His limp body slumped to the floor, releasing Reese onto the ground with a thud. </p><p>“Thank Yual you’re here!” Reese nearly cried tears of joy. However, instead of helping Reese up, Kyle quickly moved over to the client, grabbing his mouth and preventing him from clenching down. He used his hands to pry the client’s mouth open, reaching inside and checking for any suicide pills or killchips—a habit from the Galactic Era.</p><p>Kyle continued checking, stripping the client’s clothes and patting him down for any other equipment, while Sasha held him down. As he removed the shirt from the struggling client, he noticed a unique chest engraving with five interlocking lines that were all connected as part of a whole. </p><p>“First question: Who hired you? Seeing as you attacked us, you know exactly what we’re capable of,” Kyle inquired in a threatening tone and lifted the man up. </p><p>“I… I swear, I didn’t want to do this! I’m just a front for Harri—” Before he could complete his sentence, the interlocking engravings on his chest suddenly lit up, causing the client to double over and spasm violently. </p><p>Kyle and Sasha immediately backed off, expecting an attack, but instead, the client screamed as the engraving’s light grew stronger. Shortly after, smoke began rising from his chest, and his body began to smolder. The engraving suddenly ballooned into a small but brilliant ball of flame, engulfing the client in an instant and cutting his painful shrieks short. </p><p>The flame was unnatural, burning nearly instantly and turning the client’s body into a charred, blackened figure. </p><p>[What was that, sir?] Sasha was shocked, having never seen anything like it. </p><p>Reese, too, was in utter shock as Kyle turned his attention to setting him free. <em>What kind of human would be willing to set himself on fire to prevent divulging information to the enemy?</em> “That’s a crazy sense of loyalty! Madness!”</p><p>“No.” Kyle shook his head, clearly remembering the facial expression of the client before the activation. “He didn’t set himself on fire. It seems like our new enemy is smarter than expected.”</p><p>Chapter 47: Light Thrower</p><p><em>Two weeks later…</em></p><p>Gulak raised its staff, a vicious expression written all over its face as it flashed its sharp, yellow teeth. “There is nowhere left to run now, human! You die here!”</p><p>“Kyaaaa! Somebody, save me!” a scantily clad girl screamed and cowered, clasping her ears. </p><p>“No one is here to hear your screams or save you, girl!”</p><p>Gulak stepped forward, its eyes piercing at the girl with clear desire. The girl shivered even more as she watched the goblin slowly approach her.</p><p>“Don’t worry, my fair maiden! I’m coming to save you!” a loud masculine voice boomed into the cavern that the two were in, prompting the both of them to turn their heads toward the source. </p><p>Gulak could barely see the entrance of the cavern, the brilliant light shining brightly and nearly blinding its eyes. All it could see was the figure of a human man, along with a fluttering cape from behind. However, it caused him to instantly bare its teeth at the figure in hatred. “Curses! It is you again! How did you find us?!”</p><p>“Nothing can ever escape me, the mighty… err… enforcer man?”</p><p>“CUT! CUT! CUT!” Merissa screamed with all her might, throwing a book on the ground in sheer frustration. “You dense little fucker! How many times are we going to go through this fucking scene, you little shitbag!”</p><p>The vulgarities spewing out from the former slave-turned-clerk captured by Kyle and Sasha were of no surprise to the rest of the crew in the cavern. The light-capturer operator simply yawned, while a goblin nearby, who was carrying a heavy metal pole with some kind of weird-looking arctech device at the end, wobbled slightly.</p><p>“Stupid Feldon, always ruining my chances at being a star!” Gulak joined in the berating of the “enforcer man.”</p><p>“ARGGHH!” Merissa grabbed her hair, nearly ripping it out of clumps. “EVERYONE, BREAK FIVE! FELDON, IN MY OFFICE, NOW!” </p><p>The supporting crew was used to this sequence of events, immediately exiting the cavern and heading for the mess hall. The goblin nearly dropped the metal pole onto Gulak’s head before the latter grabbed the head and supported it, scowling at the goblin. “Idiot! If you break this device that Kyle crafted himself, it is over for us!”</p><p>Back in the newly expanded office, Merissa was clearly exasperated, storming into the room and slamming a book on the desk. The assistant clerks nearby were not flustered or worried at all, knowing that Merissa was on a rampage. And for a good reason too.</p><p>Merissa sat down in her chair, glaring at the meek Feldon, who was still wearing the cape. “Feldon. Can you please explain what the schedule is for today?”</p><p>Feldon gulped instinctively, nearly stuttering as he spoke. “W-We are to do the final action scene for the movie, with Kyle personally coming in to watch the new version.”</p><p>“THAT’S RIGHT—THE DEBUT MOVIE!” Merissa yelled at the top of her lungs. “YOU THINK KYLE WILL BE HAPPY WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE SO FAR?! THIS IS THE FIFTEENTH TAKE WE’VE DONE THIS MORNING! DO YOU WANT TO RETURN TO RAKTOR OR NOT?!”</p><p>“Yes, of course I do!” Feldon nodded vigorously, knowing that this was one of his options to return to the city of Raktor. </p><p>“Then this is your fucking chance to reinvent yourself as a new person so you can live happily with your family in Raktor! Why the fuck do you keep fucking up a different line every single fucking take! You’re lucky you were handsome when you took on the role at the start—because right about now you look like a fucking pile of steaming hot SHIT!” Merissa cursed louder. </p><p>“I’m sorry! Please give me another chance! I promise I’ll do it right this time!”</p><p>“Oh yeah? Recite your lines for the scenes one more time.”</p><p>“Uhhh… ‘I am an enforcer of Yual! Nothing can ever escape my sight!’”</p><p>“Good. Fuck up one more time, and I’ll personally stuff the sound recorder pole up your ass.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Bishop Vernette sat gingerly in a standalone velvet chair, with Mason flanking her. “That’s all we need? An empty room?” Mason asked warily. <em>Why do I feel like I’m about to get assassinated here?</em></p><p>Kyle groaned as he watched Reese set up the light-thrower machine, projecting a blank white image onto the opposing wall. </p><p>“This machine doesn’t look too special—it seems like it is simply a spotlight shining white. We have plenty of that in our arsenal,” Bishop Vernette remarked. </p><p>Soon, the image on the wall changed to reveal a title scene, shocking the bishop and Mason. What frightened them even more was how there were suddenly the sounds of goblin laughter echoing around the room.</p><p>Mason retrieved his arctech pistol from his belt, scanning the room and noticing the source was coming from a separate arctech radio. “What the fuck is going on?”</p><p>The bishop did not respond as violently as Mason, enthralled by the opening scene of the Culdao Peaks forest. “This… this is real? Not an optical illusion engraving?”</p><p>“Optical illusion engravings cannot change on the fly, ma’am,” Kyle patiently explained. “In order to achieve this, it is required to update the image multiple times a second. Preferably thirty times a second.”</p><p>“Yes, this is the invention of the century! Mark my words!” Reese nodded his head vigorously. It had been two weeks since they set up the company. Reese had completely quit his job as a professor, serving as the co-founder, full time under Kyle. He didn’t dare stay away from Kyle any longer, especially after the kidnapping. </p><p>Mason too stopped and watched the movie, but his main interest was in the technology. <em>So it seems that the arctech radio is synchronized with the images shown on the wall…</em></p><p>The movie was only a short five minutes, with a blazing-fast story. Mason nearly choked at the end when he saw how gaudy the “enforcer” acted. “That’s not one of ours, right?”</p><p>“No. This is simply a demonstration movie of what these machines can do.” The light-thrower machine began to wind down and eventually powered off. </p><p>The bishop remained silent, pondering while Mason was examining the light-thrower machine carefully. “You… You made this yourself?” Mason asked Kyle. </p><p>Reese cleared his throat. “<em>We</em> made it together, just to be clear. I had the idea for years!”</p><p>The bishop motioned to the inquisitor, beckoning him to come closer while she looked at Kyle. “Alvin and Reese, please give us a moment to discuss further before we talk business.”</p><p>“Of course.” Kyle left the room, leaving the two of them alone.</p><p>“Ma’am, it is fairly clear that Alvin has an ulterior motive for all of this. Need I remind you of what happened a few weeks ago with the handguns?”</p><p>“It does not matter. The handguns were destroyed—end of story. But what he and Reese have invented here has immense value.”</p><p>“Sorry, Vernette, but I don’t see—”</p><p>“Mason, this machine could be the turning point. It could even elevate me to a cardinal,” the bishop said, cutting him off before he could finish. “If we play our cards right, the reputation of the enforcers will be improved by miles.”</p><p>“What do you mean? I don’t understand.”</p><p>“With the ability to record these uhm.. movies… we can steer public opinion toward a  better perspective. Have them understand what the enforcers are exactly doing and so on.”</p><p>“But what is the best way to do that? Surely it is not using a gaudy, childish movie like that, right? Right?”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Damian grunted as he lifted up a sack of concrete with one hand, hauling it over to the mixer while another associate poured water. The building was an entire mess, completely hollowed out. It was an abandoned residential apartment, but now the associates and a hired construction crew were hollowing out and breaking down most of the walls to form a vacant space. </p><p>It had been a month and a half since the fall of the Ilysian Punks. In that time, the Seven Snakes had reconsolidated their control in their home district while slowly stabilizing the new districts they had captured from the Ilysian Punks. </p><p>The Crimson Swords debt had been fully paid off as well, a burden completely lifted off their shoulders. Damian chuckled to himself as he recalled how frantic they were when confronted with the million-rakel debt. <em>A million rakels? That’s nothing compared to the New Year party we just had.</em></p><p>With the new year heralded in with a victorious celebration, the morale of the Seven Snakes was higher than ever before. Now, their gang had progressed so fast over the last four months to achieve even greater heights than he could ever imagine. Loans of a million rakels seemed puny in hindsight, especially when he stood in front of the abandoned residential apartment, the land deed completely in the Seven Snakes’ name. </p><p>“I don’t understand. Why are we building grand steps like those in front of the Magda inside this building?” Niko scratched his head, looking again at the blueprint for this room. A few associates gathered around to check the layout as well, their heads confused by the completely different architecture and room design than they were used to. <em>Putting velvet chairs on large stairs facing a blank wall? What is going on?</em></p><p>“Is he trying to build a theater or something? Doesn’t look like any of the ones I’ve been too,” another associate replied. </p><p>“Who knows, maybe Alvin finally went full loony,” Niko murmured.</p><p>“Alvin? Who’s Alvin?” One of the newer recruits cocked his head in confusion.</p><p>“Oh boy, I remember the good ol’ days when I was just like you…”</p><p>The layout of the building was weird and novel to the associates—a theater at the very top with multiple restaurants and shops along the way. Kyle mentioned to Damian that this was called a “hypermall,” but Damian had no idea what the fuck that meant, or even what “hyper” meant.</p><p>Regardless, most of the current income of the Seven Snakes was thrown into this, plus every available associate that was not working in other businesses. However, even that was not enough, prompting the Seven Snakes to issue daily jobs to those in the district who wanted it. </p><p>Plenty of homeless squatters and poor folks took up the work immediately. For those who were on the weaker side, Keith hired them to handle the logistics and negotiations with potential tenants who would set up a restaurant or shop in the “hypermall.” The new clerks formed the basis for administrative capacity within their business. The transition to legal businesses had begun.</p><p>Keith frowned as he calculated the potential legal earnings from the theater, working out the total footfall. <em>It doesn’t seem viable at all. Why did Kyle choose this location of all places? </em></p><p>Kyle, too, dropped by from time to time, bringing along Gordon and Eric Dicar to see the construction. “What?! Who would use a heat engraving system in a shop?” Gordon exclaimed, knowing that such luxury was only reserved for the nobility. </p><p>Eric was not too concerned about that. He was more concerned with the hidden pubs that would be embedded into the area. “You’re planning to sell alcohol in your new ‘theater’ too?!”</p><p>Kyle pointed at a map, showing them the nearby buildings. “The location of this theater is slightly out of the way of the center, but there are more than enough roads leading here. We’ll charter regular wagons from each of the districts we control to this hypermall, boosting people’s collective recognition of the place. The light shows that will be held in the new theater will give us an initial boost. The objective of the entire hypermall is to elevate the local residents to a higher standard of living.”</p><p>Gordon caught on to what was happening. “You want to make our district the envy of everyone else in the South Sector.”</p><p>“Exactly. Once we complete this project, it will demonstrate our willingness and the ‘need’ for our inclusion in the local society. Running pubs and brothels doesn’t exactly fulfill that goal.’” Kyle nodded.</p><p>This had always been the plan since he caught wind of the development of the camera, reported to him by one of his associates who had seen the pub fight. </p><p>This allowed him to establish a privately owned movie company headed by him and Reese, making his position much more legitimate. The money used to build the new hypermall was less legitimate, but the locals would not care about it if it improved their standard of living.</p><p>If everything played out correctly, Kyle could create a chance for himself to garner a reputation on a more legal and genuine basis. He understood that positions obtained solely through violence were untenable. <em>A crime lord is always actively balancing the scales between reputation and illegal deeds, never going too far on either side. </em></p><p>Furthermore, such an economic project would give him the necessary resources to fight toe to toe with the Ardent Cretins in the near future. Despite having defeated the Ilysian Punks, Kyle was well aware that he did not do it on his own. Any direct physical conflict with the Ardent Cretins would result in complete failure. <em>Only an economic war within the sector or external benefits can give me the edge necessary to compete.</em></p><p>“This will put us into the spotlight, potentially endangering all our other operations!” Eric frantically pointed out. “Everyone knows that you are the leader of the Seven Snakes as well—would the enforcers not simply investigate and dig up the evidence?”</p><p>“Ah, I have already reached a mutually beneficial deal with the enforcers under the name of our new private movie company. That reminds me, Gordon. I need you to handle filming tomorrow.”</p><p>“Filming? In the city? If you’re planning on filming the production lines, I can assure you it is absolutely boring.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous. We would never film anything that boring. Instead, we’re filming a protest.”</p><p>Chapter 48: Protests</p><p>“It is Nona, our goddess, who has shaped the earth as it is; who has laid out every food, animal, monster, and plant for our needs. And the Word of the Goddess states—‘I have created everything on this planet for the enjoyment of the human race. Who dares claim that humans shall not consume what I have created?.’”</p><p>“YEAH, YEAH!” The throng of people gathered on the streets, cheering at a person standing on top of an arctech wagon that slowly chugged forward, forming a parade. </p><p>“Yet the Sanctum of Yual claims that consumption of such <em>sacred</em> goods is a sin and beyond what we, the common folk, can handle.” The person donned a blinding red robe, his head adorned with what seemed to be an ornamental oriental piece. He held an upright posture, his speech passionate through the arctech loudhailer as the crowd roared back in response.</p><p>“YEAH!”</p><p>“The audacity, folks! The audacity of the religion to demean you. To put you lower than those who serve the ‘living god,’ the Emperor of the Yual Dominion. Are you not sapient? Are you not capable of self-control? Are you not HUMAN!?”</p><p>“WE ARE HUMAN!” The crowd was riled up, with a loud wave of fanfare exploding across the street. </p><p>“Then let us show them our displeasure! Show our anger, our wrath! Only by marching out in solidarity can the rulers of this city truly understand what they have created—injustice among the common folk. Rise, brothers. Rise!”</p><p>“YEAAAAAAAH!” </p><p>A few cries from the front of the parade were heard as people began to spot a blockade at the front. Fifty armed enforcers had their wagons parked sideways to block the streets. </p><p>The enthusiasm of the crowd noticeably fell, with the cheering and shouting being toned down a good amount. “Brothers, we are here simply to show our presence. We are not violent—for our Goddess Nona has proclaimed the divine worth of every human soul. Despite their misguided views, it is our duty to peacefully convert them.”</p><p>A wave of murmurs spread through the crowd, with many agreeing. No one wanted to get into a conflict with the enforcers—as much as they hated the idea of the prohibition bans on alcohol, they did not want to be imprisoned or lose their jobs. </p><p>“We are peaceful protesters! We shall show our stance here and now by camping in the stre—”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud shattering of glass was heard as a shop’s window was smashed into by a few protesters, with many scrambling in to grab the goods and rakels from the shop. The shop owner did not dare fight against the mob, immediately running away. </p><p>The red-robed person’s face balked immediately. “Brothers, we are not here to raid or pillage, but to change the laws! Why are we—“ </p><p>“HEY, YOU STUPID CUNTS! GET OFF THE STREETS!” </p><p>He turned to face the source of the voice, noticing it was a group of masked thugs. “YOU’RE FUCKING UP OUR TERRITORY HERE! BREAK IT UP!”</p><p>The thugs shoved their way through the crowd, trying to forcibly disperse it. The enforcers did not make a single move and simply watched the spectacle. </p><p>“Hey, we’re just doing a peaceful protest here!” One of the protesters tried to square up against the thugs. </p><p>“Oh yeah? Take a piece of this!” The thug immediately swung the metal pipe in his hand on the protestor’s head, knocking him out cold. </p><p>Immediately, the protesters began to scream and panic. “You fucking bitches!” another protestor yelled as he charged with a group toward the thugs, forming a massive melee brawl that soon spread throughout the entire crowd. </p><p>The red-robed person was shocked and confused. “Stop fighting! Stop fighting!”</p><p>However, the protesters were not listening any longer, fully caught up in the heat of the battle. They were not about to just let the thugs hit them and get away with it. They had to exact revenge and defend themselves.</p><p>The protesters began to spread out over the street, the chaos and conflict spreading even further. Many of the protesters were not there because they believed in Nona, the goddess, but rather to take part in the movement. </p><p>Some used the chaos to raid and pillage some of the shops, and when the fighting spilled out into the residential blocks as protesters and thugs chased each other, the local residents too got caught up in the fighting. </p><p>[PROTESTERS, THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING. VIOLENCE AGAINST RESIDENTS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. STAND DOWN IN THREE MINUTES OR WE WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE ACTION.] A loudhailer echoed across the streets. </p><p>The warning was not heeded by anyone in the protesting crowd, with each person fighting for a multitude of reasons. Those that tried to run from the fight were chased down by the thugs, forcing them to fight back to defend themselves. </p><p>[TIME’S UP. MOVE IN!]</p><p>The enforcers marched forward in a row, with protesters lashing out at them in the heat of the battle. They were immediately pinned down and arrested by the better-equipped enforcers before being hauled off to a detention center. </p><p>At the top of a building, Gordon peered through the lens of the light-capturer machine. “Magnification lenses seem to be doing pretty well. We’re getting a lot of good images here.”</p><p>“Why are we filming the protest?” Reese asked Kyle, who was staring intently at the leader of the protest. </p><p>“The enforcers are our very first customer. This is not the first time this protest has happened,” Kyle explained slowly, turning to face Reese to observe his reaction. <em>He was originally a university professor, so he may have some issues…</em></p><p>Reese wasn’t dumb, immediately getting the gist of it. “We’re selling them a movie showing how violent the protesters are.”</p><p>“Yes, the revenue and the recognition of our movie company will spread even faster with the support of the enforcers. This will help us offset the cost of the building.”</p><p>“Monetizing influence, I understand.” Reese nodded his head. </p><p>“I would have expected you to be more displeased.”</p><p>“Before I was kidnapped, I would have thrown a tantrum at this. But after… I can clearly tell some corners have to be cut if I want to live and see my invention through,” Reese explained, though a hint of wariness could be seen in his eyes. <em>Kyle may very well try to kill me or have me removed if I ever go against his plans…</em></p><p>“That’s good, then.” Kyle smiled as though nothing was wrong, patting Reese on the back. “Gordon, I think that should be enough footage for now.” </p><p>Gordon nodded. “Right. But what do we do about the audio recordings?”</p><p>“The thugs will bring them back to our base. Let’s wrap it up.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The red-robed person was tossed into the holding cell along with a group of protesters. He had been badly beaten by the enforcers during an interrogation, his skin raw and his robe nearly ripped to shreds. “Brother Long Hua, are you okay?” One of the protesters quickly moved over to check his wounds. </p><p>“Thank you for your concern, brother. This is part of the tribulations the Goddess has given us, so I will bear the pain.” Long Hua struggled to get up. </p><p>“Damn these enforcers!” Another protestor chimed in as he slammed the wall. </p><p>“Fret not, my brothers. I have been to many other countries—it takes time, effort, and most importantly, persistence.”</p><p>The other protesters’ eyes lit up, quickly clamoring around Long Hua. “So it is true! You have visited other countries!”</p><p>“Indeed I have, and the number of our brothers has stretched far and wide across countless sovereignties.”</p><p>“Even in Versia?”</p><p>“Oh, far more than Versia and the Yual Dominion. Hwayul, Irimeo, and Kharaku—those are the major countries that I have visited thus far, not to mention the innumerable towns and cities that fall in between jurisdictions.”</p><p>“That’s strange,” a protestor interrupted. “My mom is from Hwayul and I never heard anything about this religion before.”</p><p>“Of course—our brotherhood is repressed across the entire continent, so it is no wonder that the news regarding us is heavily controlled! The governments do not want such a religion to become dominant.”</p><p>“Ah, that makes sense,” the protesters all murmured in agreement. </p><p>“But this also means that the movement is suffering heavily. We need money for the cause, to further support our fight against unilateral oppression.”</p><p>“How will the money be used?”</p><p>“As our missionaries are ostracized and shunned widely, the money will be used on smuggling us into various cities, as well as daily necessities.”</p><p>The protesters and Long Hua talked a bit longer, for an hour or two, with Long Hua continuously preaching to them, increasing their zealousness. </p><p>Soon, an enforcer opened the holding cell’s gate, releasing them. “Don’t you idiots think about trying to raise another riot anytime soon. Especially you, Long Hua. This is the second time—go against the Sanctum of Yual one more time, and you’ll be sentenced to slavery in the mines.”</p><p>“The laws of your countries do not bind me as much as the Word of the Goddess.”</p><p>“Whatever, fuck off.” The enforcer shooed them off. The protesters walked off together toward their previous gathering point, where some of the more persistent protesters were already waiting. </p><p>“Brother Long Hua, I will donate a few hundred rakels to the cause,” one of the protesters quickly offered, clearly enticed by the prospect of social change.</p><p>“Me too, anything to change the prohibition!”</p><p>The protesters all stood in solidarity, handing over rakels to Long Hua. “My brothers, your stay in heaven next to our Goddess will be glorious. Your graciousness will be remembered for centuries, unlike those who rest on their laurels, lording over us!”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>“Our compassion far surpasses theirs. However, it is not the right time to push for the cause immediately now. We must bid our time, slowly building our strength. I will contact all of you soon. For now, focus your eyes on the final goal, and persist!”</p><p>“Yes, Brother Long Hua!”</p><p>Long Hua left the area, holding on tightly to the bag of rakels he had just collected from the protesters. He glanced behind him a couple of times, and as soon as he was a few urban blocks away, he quickly made a sharp turn into an alleyway. </p><p>Reaching into a hidden bag lodged behind a trash pile, he patted the grime off of it before pulling out a new set of clothes. He stuffed the red robe and headset into the bag and placed it back. A grin appeared on his face as he double-checked the number of rakels he had managed to get. <em>Looks like I’ve exhausted this sector—perhaps it’s time to move onto the next one.</em></p><p>As he strolled out of the alleyway, he was suddenly approached by a well-dressed gentleman, who was clearly muscular under the impeccable formal suit. “Brother Long Hua, I have finally found you! But why are you not dressed in your red robe?”</p><p>Long Hua was caught off-guard, quickly coughing and clearing his throat. “Ahem, I need to lie low for a while in order to avoid being arrested by the enforcers once more.” He quickly hid the bag of rakels behind his back, smiling genially at the gentleman. “Are you one of the followers of Nona as well?”</p><p>“Yes, I was very inspired by your passionate speech during the protest yesterday!” The gentleman nodded his head. </p><p>“Good, but this is not a good time for us to discuss such things out in the open. I’m sure you understand how the enforcers are.”</p><p>“But of course! I have a wagon ready nearby if you need me to ferry you anywhere. Perhaps I can offer a tithe of my own as well at my very own restaurant…”</p><p>Long Hua’s eyes glinted with greed as he stood further upright, enhancing his “holy posture.” “The Goddess will bless you for your offering, my brother. Lead the way.”</p><p>They entered a simple arctech wagon, though Long Hua noticed a lingering smell that he could not quite put his finger on. <em>Potions? A bit suspicious for a restaurant owner… but it is good to have a wealthy supporter. </em>Long Hua wouldn’t say no to being treated like a king. </p><p>The gentleman motioned for the driver to carry on while smiling widely at Long Hua. “I am thoroughly impressed with how well you riled up the crowd. You have an elegant way with words.”</p><p>“All thanks to the Goddess Nona, who has blessed me to be her mouthpiece. To be able to have my words heard by the masses is my only goal.”</p><p>“Hmm, but your skills seem to be underutilized. Such a shame. Also, judging from the bag of rakels, that doesn’t seem to be your only goal.”</p><p>Long Hua immediately squinted, his expression souring. “You’re not a follower. Let me out immediately.”</p><p>“Long Hua—or should I call you Guang Hwa? Born in the Hwa Dynasty and raised in Versia, joined the military at the age of 13. Dishonorably discharged under General Javel for selling and trading contraband goods, as well as selling classified information to other countries. Also publicly charged for leading an insurrection against the ruling Versian government.”</p><p>Long Hua brandished a knife from his clothes, aiming it at the gentleman. “I don’t know how you got that information, but know that you are now dead to me.”</p><p>Before Long Hua could do anything even more, the gentleman lunged forward, with the knife striking against a hidden vambrace under the formal suit, clanging against the armor. In a rapid combo, the gentleman grappled Long Hua and twisted his wrist, forcing him to drop the knife as he screamed in agony.</p><p>“ARGGHHH! W-who…WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!” </p><p>“Your new owner. I have a better use for your… oratorial skills.”</p><p>Chapter 49: Hypermall</p><p><em>One month later…</em></p><p>Baron Cain shifted his gaze uneasily as he adjusted his necktie and collar, glancing around the ballroom nervously. It was slightly packed, with many noble families laughing and eating happily, mingling with each other. </p><p>“Ah, Cain Detrius. It’s been a while since we met.” A lesser noble walked up to him. </p><p>“Indeed. I believe the previous gathering two months ago, the New Year celebration, was the last time we’ve met.” Baron Cain focused his attention on the short, stocky man, who clearly had an ulterior motive instead of just small talk. </p><p>“Yes, you don’t usually come to any other gatherings apart from these quarterly ones, don’t you? I do have a few acquaintances that would be more than happy to have your company. There is room for tangible benefits here.”</p><p>“I will consider it; however, right now I have my hands full.”</p><p>“Ah, that ugly building in the South Sector that has just been built? What an eyesore that is, and to think it was built by the common folk. How repulsive. I assume you’re going to take it down?”</p><p>“I am working on it,” Baron Cain curtly replied. <em>Mind your own business, you fucking twat.</em> If the lesser noble next to him was just a common folk or an inquisitor, he would have him caned or whipped immediately.</p><p>However, even though the lesser noble did not hold a land or title, he and everyone else here had some form of ties with each other due to inter-familial marriages. Baron Cain eked out a fake smile as the lesser noble continued to talk his ears off, obviously intending to pry out what the baron’s next steps were. </p><p>“I’ve heard the construction union is extremely unhappy about how the building was done. Rumor has it that it was a brand new construction company that seems to be building at near cost rather than matching union prices.”</p><p>Baron Cain simply nodded in response, unwilling to divulge any further. Indeed, he knew that Kyle was the one who had set up the new construction company. The building was fairly innovative in some aspects, with the construction company filing for intellectual property protection from him.</p><p>He had yet to approve the process, but he was naturally afraid of antagonizing Kyle—it was only through the compromise they made that the spread of repeater handguns was stopped indefinitely. Kyle had kept true to their word, with no more handguns hitting the black market. </p><p>However, he did not underestimate Kyle, knowing that the man could retaliate against any perceived aggression from his side by releasing a hidden stash of handguns. It was what he would have done in his position as well, after all. In short, he could not do anything to Kyle on the outside. The gang leader seemed to have him in a stranglehold for now.</p><p>Kyle did not push the baron too much, falling in line with the other gangs and also providing him with a tithe of their profits on the same percentage as the Ardent Cretins. This assuaged the baron’s ego slightly, knowing that whatever profits the Seven Snakes made, he would have a cut of it. Otherwise, he would have blocked all land deed sales to the Seven Snakes.</p><p>He swirled the wine in his glass with his left hand, the hilt of his handgun tapping against the interior of his suit. He had followed Kyle’s advice and left it in a thick metal safe, saving it from whatever methods of arctech activation Kyle had. A team under his payroll was already trying to reverse-engineer the handgun as well as come up with a replica. <em>Maybe I can sell such an invention to the military myself. </em></p><p>“Announcing the entrance of Count Leon!” a servant called out loudly, with the grand double doors of the ballroom revealing a blonde-haired man dressed in a fully decorated blue uniform, walking in with a big smile. </p><p>The lesser nobles and barons clapped as Count Leon walked in, his features dazzlingly handsome. He walked up briskly to the front of the ballroom, swiveling around on his heel before facing the audience. </p><p>“Fellow members, thank you all again for attending this quarterly gathering of Raktor. I understand that many of you have pressing issues to petition me, and today is exactly the day to do so. However, before I start, I would like to say a word to honor one of our own, who has done a tremendous job. Baron Cain, please.” Count Leon motioned to the baron, who was slightly shocked. </p><p>As Cain walked up, his brain was running through all the reasons why he was called up. In fact, the very reason why he was so nervous at the start was that he thought that Count Leon would admonish him for losing the guns in the first place.</p><p>“Baron Cain is an exemplary ruler—he was able to quell and root out a foreign power’s attempt at stealing our technology. With such extensive evidence of Versia’s interference in our affairs, we now have justification for retribution and to seek reparations from Versia. Not only that, he did it all in a span of three months, stabilizing the South Sector!”</p><p>Cain smiled as he gently bowed to the clapping audience, though his eyes were still glancing at the count’s expression. <em>So Count Leon made some money off threatening Versia, thanks to my initial failure, while I got nothing but an irritating gang leader on my side. How convenient.</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>“Quickly, quickly! Ollie, we’re going to be late!” A kid slapped another kid right on the face, causing him to jolt awake.</p><p>“Late? Late for what?”</p><p>“The opening of the new… erm… arcade? Shopping arcade. Something like that?”</p><p>“Shopping? We have no money even to buy groceries, let alone go shopping! Shut up and let me sleep.”</p><p>“I heard that there would be free candy given out!”</p><p>“We’re going immediately!” Ollie shot up from his makeshift bed on the hard warehouse, changing into his clothes quickly. The abandoned building they lived in was terribly rundown, the paint on the walls clearly peeling off, while the double-decker beds creaked loudly as other kids also scrambled to get ready. </p><p>Ollie cupped his hands under a water tap, wincing from the near ice-cold water, before splashing his face and rubbing with an obviously used towel. “Come on, Ollie, quick!”</p><p>“I’m coming, I’m coming!” Ollie scampered out of the room, running down the hallway with the rest of the kids. However, the boy suddenly came to a halt, stopping right outside a makeshift tent barricaded by rusty barrels and dirty clothes. “Mister, do you want candy? I can bring some back for you!”</p><p>“Thank you kindly, but there’s no need to. You go enjoy yourself now.” The old squatter smiled weakly, obvious beads of sweat trickling down his wrinkles and chaffed skin. </p><p>Ollie nodded, sprinting off to catch up with the group of kids. They laughed and shouted as they ran out onto the streets, avoiding the scowling pedestrians and raging wagon drivers. “Where’s the new shopping arcade? Which street is it?”</p><p>“I heard it’s a single building with thousands of shops inside!”</p><p>“Thousands? How is that possible? Don’t joke around; I work at the factory part-time! Even I know you can’t fit in that many.”</p><p>“It’s true! I heard Guang Hwa say it himself! He even told me directly that we get a free hot bath when we get there!”</p><p>“Okay, now that’s too farfetched!” OIlie panted as he sprinted, slowing down to a walk. “They’ll never let us into that place now—even the public baths don’t accept us!” </p><p>“I’m serious, Ollie, come on!”</p><p>The kids ran down a series of blocks and finally reached an extremely crowded cross junction. They could barely see above the heads of the adults that were all standing there, but they knew the crowd was ogling <em>something</em>. “Let’s squeeze to the front!”</p><p>They used their small bodies to push through the legs of the crowd, weaving through as they managed to get near the front. As they got closer, they began to hear a voice speaking passionately as it was propagated over multiple arctech radios spread across the street. “That’s the guy! That’s Guang Hwa!”</p><p>[Today marks the beginning of a new era in this district. The building behind me offers the best services, food, and entertainment, at a level unheard of in this district, not to mention the very first light-thrower theater!]</p><p>The crowd murmured between each other, all of them gradually becoming more excited. Word of the invention of the light-thrower had been spread quite thoroughly, especially with the enforcers using it to improve their reputations. Many of them had already seen movies of the protesters attacking the enforcers, only to end up arrested.</p><p>[Fret not—the first meal, item, and theater ticket you buy in this shopping mall is free today!]</p><p>“FREE?!” One of the crowd members was shocked, his excitement organically spreading to the people around.</p><p>[That is right. The Golden Snake Construction Company is proud to sponsor the opening day of this building. As its spokesperson, I shall now declare the building—OPEN!]</p><p>Guang Hwa turned around and cut a symbolic ribbon, much to the fanfare of the people. The floodgates literally opened, with the crowd rushing forward to enter the building. However, the members at the front of the crowd immediately slowed down upon seeing the fifty or so Seven Snakes associates, all armed and armored, serving as the private guards for the shopping arcade. </p><p>There were even enforcers stationed at the entrance, glaring down at the approaching crowd members. The mob immediately calmed down, word traveling rapidly from the front to the back. </p><p>“Shit, the enforcers are here! Don’t push!”</p><p>“Why the fuck do you care about the enforcers—the stuff in that shopping arcade is free! We have to move before it’s gone!”</p><p>“Idiot, have you not seen how badly the protesters fared when they attacked the enforcers?”</p><p>“You’re the idiot! I was there at the protest myself; it was the thugs who attacked first!”</p><p>“Don’t lie to me! I saw the light-thrower pictures; it was clearly the protesters who attacked first!”</p><p>Just like that, the effect of the edited movie Kyle and the enforcers had distributed began to take root in the people, instilling them with more fear and less inclination to fight against the enforcers. </p><p>The crowd began to queue up in an orderly fashion, guided by the enforcers and the Seven Snakes guards. Ollie and the other kids quickly ran up to Guang Hwa, swarming him. “You promised us candy, Guang Hwa!”</p><p>“My name is Long H—oh,  hi kids!” Guang Hwa caught himself before he leaked his old name. He squatted and rubbed the nearest kid’s hair playfully. “Yes, of course, there’s candy! There’s a candy shop right inside. Just queue up, and you’ll get it in an instant! First taste is free!”</p><p>Ollie immediately queued up. The Seven Snakes guards vetted each individual, checking them for hidden weapons and so on and ultimately allowing them to enter. Ollie peeked through the queue, already seeing people browsing the candy shop and clothing stores beyond the glass doors.</p><p>As Ollie walked up to the guard, the guard blocked his path and pointed him to another entrance at the side. Ollie noticed that the guards were redirecting all the unkept and shabbily dressed folks there, causing him to get mad. “HEY! YOU’RE DISCRIMINATING!”</p><p>“Go to that entrance, or you won’t be able to get in.”</p><p>Ollie was about to grumble before Guang Hwa suddenly bent over next to him, smiling at him. “Don’t worry, we just have to get you cleaned up!”</p><p>“The last person to say that to me robbed me of everything! You think I’ll believe a cunt like you?” Ollie retorted, about to storm off when his friends quickly stopped him. </p><p>“Fine, how about this? All of you kids can follow me in. Surely I can’t rob all of you at the same time, right?”</p><p>“YAY, GUANG HWA!” The kids screamed his name, running forward quickly into the side entrance. Ollie followed along warily, still keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. However, as soon as he entered the side entrance, his jaw dropped immediately. “This… This is madness!”</p><p>In front of him was the interior of a wide indoor bath house, with more than thirty separate pools and a thousand showering cubicles, and it seemed that there was still more construction going on in the upper levels from the thumping sounds above as well as the Seven Snakes associates lugging material up.</p><p>Naturally, the kids did not care, immediately stripping their clothes off and placing them on 	a shelf before trying to sprint into the pools. However, Guang Hwa quickly stepped in front of them, blocking them. “HEY, YOU PROMISED US A HOT BATH!”</p><p>“I did, but you have to shower first!”</p><p>The water coming out of the shower was heated, much to the surprise of Ollie, who had lived his entire life with nearly cold water, save for the heated barrels in his squatter tent. He closed his eyes and let the hot water wash the sludge and stains that had been on his body for months, his mind in pure bliss. </p><p>“Scrub! Scrub hard!” A few of the workers in the bathhouse came to pass the kids a simple bristle scrub, with Ollie recognizing one of the workers. “Bola? How did you get here? I thought you were working at a construction site!”</p><p>“Ollie! You made it! I got a job from the Golden Snake people; they pay real good money, and you get to almost live like a king on your off days. You know there’s a dorm for workers here, too? It’s amazing!”</p><p>Ollie was even more shocked, his mind in turmoil as he continued to listen to his friend gush about how the work life was here and his time hanging out with the Seven Snakes. <em>This… This is it! This is my ticket out of the slums!</em></p><p>Chapter 50: Collusion</p><p>The opening day of the shopping arcade was in full swing, with hundreds of visitors flocking toward the shopping malls.</p><p>Kyle watched the entire affair from the top-floor office’s balcony, overlooking the front lobby of the shopping arcade, a mere five stories above. Keith was already giddy with excitement, watching the visitors browse the various stalls. “This is it! I can smell the money!” Keith laughed.</p><p>“Don’t get ahead of yourself—we need to make sure the first light-thrower show is perfect,” Kyle warned. “Have the associates patrol the floors regularly, especially the bathhouse.”</p><p>Keith quickly calmed himself down, nodding in agreement. “Got it. I’ll keep an eye out.”</p><p>“Good.” Kyle exited the office, intending to make a tour around and ensure everything was going according to his plan.</p><p>The shopping arcade layout was simple—he decided not to innovate too much lest unknown organizations be watching him. It was clear to him that he was not the only one aware of Galactic Era technology, which meant he had to keep a low profile.</p><p>As such, each of the companies he established had a figurehead in place to serve as the public face. If Kyle wanted to grow his influence legally, he needed frontmen to absorb the shock and hate where necessary. Of course, the locals knew that he was the main guy in charge, but that was not the case for foreigners and other districts’ residents who would come over to patronize the “shopping arcade.”</p><p>Even if the enforcers and lesser nobility knew who he was and how much he controlled, it was still better to stay out of the public spotlight as much as possible—no reason to pose front and center just to jeopardize his position.</p><p>Kyle reached the bottom of the lobby through an arctech elevator, feeling the cool wind that blew through the corridor of the shopping arcade. He limited the innovations within the shopping arcade to three main points: temperature control, light-thrower cinema, cleaning inventions</p><p><em>These three innovations are hardly revolutionary—they should not freak out anyone working with Galactic Era tech…</em> Kyle was acutely aware of his animosity with Versia now, especially Harrison, who seemed to have targeted his technology. He had no doubt that the Ilysian Punks and those who were backing them from beyond the border would return to harass him or to take revenge. <em>I may need to go to Versia eventually to settle this. Perhaps I can gain something there to use as leverage against the Ardent Cretins. </em></p><p>Kyle didn’t know what to expect in Versia yet, but as long as there were benefits to be had, Kyle would grasp the opportunity as hard as he could.</p><p>As he walked out to the front lobby, he noticed Guang Hwa smiling at a group of reporters, his face covered in makeup to make him look like a completely different individual, lest he be recognized as Long Hua.</p><p>“President Hwa, can you tell me what inspired you to start such a large project?”</p><p>“Of course. The Golden Snake Construction Company is, first and foremost, dedicated to the betterment of the common folk. We want to improve the standard of living for everyone in our district. However, it is not limited to just this district alone—we would like to extend our hand to everyone in the city of Raktor to come and visit at least once!”</p><p>“Offering free entry to the bathhouse for everyone seems to be a completely unprofitable venture; how is the company funding any of this? The cost to clean such a large bathhouse meant to serve thousands will be astronomical!” A reporter jabbed an arctech radio in front of his face, obviously trying to dig out some dirt.</p><p>“Indeed it would be… if we were relying on current technology. However, we have partnered with our sister company, Cobra Cleaning Solutions, in order to alleviate such a cost. I cannot divulge further as the innovations are a secret. However! Today, on this glorious opening day, we will be showcasing the first public screening of a light-thrower show!”</p><p>“A light-thrower show? Is it the same machine that the enforcers have been using to campaign recently?”</p><p>“Indeed, it is. The enforcers have worked very closely with our new theater company—Silver Snakes Productions. And speaking of the devil, here he is!”</p><p>The reporters turned to see the Seven Snakes guards clearing a path as a luxurious arctech wagon pulled up, with Reese stepping out in a slick tuxedo, his hair clearly well-done and his skin glistening in the daylight.</p><p>Kyle glanced over to a Seven Snakes associate who was filming the entire thing with a light-capturer. He walked up to the associate and lightly tapped him on the shoulder. “Don’t aim at the reporters, aim at Reese.”</p><p>“U-Uh, yes sir right away!” The associate was nearly shocked to death by Kyle’s sudden approach, hastily repositioning himself to get the correct viewing angle.</p><p>The reporters immediately swarmed Reese as he got out of the wagon, clamoring and asking him questions. “One at a time, people, one at a time!”</p><p>“Reese, you have been credited with the invention of the light-capturer and light-thrower—how do you feel right now?”</p><p>“I feel vindicated. I am proud and happy that there were so many people who came out in support of my work. It has been a long hard journey with many obstacles, but I am glad to say that today is a new era in theater and the entertainment industry!”</p><p>Reese continued to answer questions with a steadfast expression, his eyes winking at Kyle, who hung back. Kyle nodded his head, satisfied with the performance so far.</p><p>The crime lord walked around the perimeter of the shopping arcade, heading toward what was set up to be a transportation hub of sorts. Dozens of arctech wagons were here, with many local residents disembarking and entering the shopping arcade.</p><p>He watched as a packed arctech wagon entered one of the berths, unloading a dozen families who looked as though they were coming to a theme park. He spotted Monica in the front passenger seat of the wagon, who waved to him.</p><p>“How’s the transportation so far?” Kyle asked as he approached.</p><p>“Working fine. As you can see, I managed to negotiate a fair working wage for all the drivers here; they won’t have any qualms about what we’re doing,” Monica replied as she glanced around suspiciously, her eyes locked on an enforcer who was helping to guard the perimeter of the shopping arcade as well. “We working with them now?”</p><p>“It’s complicated. They won’t arrest us outright, but if they see it right in front of their faces, they’ll act.”</p><p>“Got it.” Monica nodded before beckoning for Kyle to get on as well.</p><p>“Hey, you. Drive into the basement,” Monica ordered the driver.</p><p>“Basement? How can you drive into a basement?” The driver was confused, glancing around.</p><p>“Idiot, it’s at the end of the hub. I taught you during your induction. You need servicing; go there.”</p><p>“Who says I need servicing?”</p><p>“Says me. You’re working for me now, remember?”</p><p>The driver grumbled to himself as he restarted the arctech wagon, driving into a downward slope that led to an underground warehouse below the shopping arcade, where the unused wagons were stored. </p><p>“I’ll take over from here; go wait in the break room.” Monica urged the driver out, who quickly scampered away.</p><p>Monica drove the arctech wagon into a service workshop, where two Seven Snakes associates were already waiting. Kyle hopped out of the back of the wagon, motioning for the two associates to begin.</p><p>They began to remove the floorboard, revealing barrels of alcohol layered into the base of the wagon. Grunting as they lifted it and placed it onto a trolley, they followed Kyle from behind as he led into a double door at the back of the workshop, which opened to reveal a full-fledged pub, packed to the brim with customers. </p><p>The Seductive Serpent’s branch had been open here, with Eric Dicar personally stationed at the mall. He was laughing as he served customers non-stop at the bar, happily explaining all of the different types of alcohol here. Kyle recognized nearly all the customers as regulars at the other Seven Snakes’ businesses, noticing Karl and the factory workers partying at the back.</p><p>Eric noticed Kyle, his joyful expression quickly diminishing as he quickly sauntered over, bowing slightly to Kyle.</p><p>“How’s the bar going?”</p><p>“First day, and it’s already a riot. Sales are through the roof. Honestly, you should’ve placed the brewery here.” Alas, the new branch did not have space for the brewery.</p><p>“Better to keep things separate for now. Harder to track.”</p><p>“Right. I heard Reese is already at the theater. You should head over.”</p><p>Kyle nodded, heading to the projector room of the theater on the top floor of the shopping arcade. A group of associates were still running around in the room, setting up everything for the upcoming show.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah. One two three, radio check.” Gordon’s voice boomed across the theater, blasting out from the various arctech radio placed around.</p><p>“Gordon, any issues?”</p><p>“Everything is working perfectly; we’re good to go in a few minutes,” Gordon replied without looking back as he double-checked the audio playback, making sure it was properly synchronized. “Sound is okay. So is the light-thrower. However, I’ve been monitoring the arcite fuel consumption of the entire building. Do we even have enough money to pay?”</p><p>“Only for the next three months.”</p><p>“We need to find a more stable source of arcite ore; maybe we can set up our own energy company as well. Have you considered expanding to Versia?”</p><p>“Versia? Is it good for arcite ore?”</p><p>“Not as good as Tryas, but at least you don’t run the risk of angering the nobility here.”</p><p><em>Versia… I do have plans to head over eventually, but it is not the right time… </em>Kyle could hardly leave the Seven Snakes as they were right now. With multiple legal companies in the spotlight, he knew enemies could come from anywhere.</p><p>“Anywhere that’s closer to Raktor?”</p><p>“Hmm… we had an operation in the Culdao Peaks, and I recall it used to be an arcite mine. Perhaps you could find undiscovered veins there? I know the nobles gave up fighting the goblins, so there’s a chance they missed something.”</p><p>“I’ll think about it.”</p><p>The theater was already packed to the brim, with the seating capacity being five thousand and many more standing in the aisle. Reese was just about finished with his opening speech on the main stage.</p><p>“...and without further ado, I present to you the first commercial movie by the Silver Snake Productions: Princess Rescue!”</p><p>Gordon flicked the light-thrower on while activating the audio playback device at the same time. The opening scene began to show on the grand white wall that was as smooth as marble, reflecting the images perfectly.</p><p>The audience gasped in awe as they saw the largest moving “painting” they had ever seen, complete with audio as well as a tribal drum beat echoing through the theater.</p><p><em>In the depths of the mountain, a lone princess captured by a goblin tribe cries for help… Who can save her?</em></p><p>“<em>Kyaaaa! Somebody, save me!” </em></p><p>The princess’s voice resounded, drawing the audience more and more into the scene.</p><p><em>An evil goblin grins widely as he steps closer to the princess. “No one's here to hear your screams nor save yo—”</em></p><p>Without warning, the light-thrower machine suddenly cut off, losing power completely. The arctech radio faltered too, the audio warbling and distorting as the theater was plunged into complete darkness. </p><p>“What? What’s going on? Is this part of the show?”</p><p>“I can’t see anything; what happened to the painting?!”</p><p>Kyle quickly grabbed an arctech radio off a nearby table, barking into it. “What’s going on? Why isn’t the backup kicking in?”</p><p>[Sir, someone sabotaged both the main and the backup arcite fuel generator. It’s a complete mess in here!]</p><p>“Fuck! Get the associates in here now to handle the crowd. Guang Hwa, grab a loudhailer and calm down the crowd!” Kyle stormed out of the projector room and into the office. The entire shopping arcade had somehow lost power, with the arctech engravings originally powered by a single grid no longer working as expected. </p><p>Even the backup was not working, fueling Kyle’s worst fears. Keith was already in the office, desperately trying to call an arcite fuel company. “We need an arcite fuel generator here as soon as… What do you mean no? I’m willing to pay five hundred thousand rakels—no, a million rakels for you to come down right now!”</p><p>Keith’s face balked as the radio went silent, causing him to grip the table in anger. “Kyle, no company wants to help us at all! What’s going on?! It feels like they are ganging up on us!”</p><p>“Even the ones we have a contract with?”</p><p>Keith nodded, with Kyle gritting his teeth. <em>It’s too much of a coincidence. </em>Whoever sabotaged the opening day knew exactly what was going to happen, and there were a few people who would have the incentive to do so. <em>Could it be Harrison again? No. A Versian industrialist wouldn’t have that much power in Raktor. Only a few other individuals would have such power…</em></p><p>“Looks like it’s time to have a chat.”</p><p>Chapter 51: Sustainability</p><p><em>Three days later…</em></p><p>Sebastian sipped on a cup of tea at a luxurious restaurant in the Central Sector. As he placed the cup down, he could already hear slightly agitated footsteps approaching him from behind.</p><p>“The great leader of the Seven Snakes, this agitated. You should be happier—your opening day for the shopping arcade went extremely well, save for the slight delay.” Sebastian spoke without turning around.</p><p>“A delay you engineered.”</p><p>“An unfounded accusation.”</p><p>“I know the Ardent Cretins have a tight grip on the unions here. You’ve been pressuring them to increase the price of arcite fuel for us.” Kyle spoke directly as he sat opposite Sebastian, his face clearly incensed.</p><p>“Mr. Kyle, I am a proponent of the free market. You cannot sincerely believe I am to blame for the increase in price. Perhaps the market has shifted significantly since you built the shopping arcade?”</p><p>“I doubt the market can shift enough for a company to be willing to renege on a prior contract.”</p><p>“Perhaps the company may be facing certain personal issues of their own.” Sebastian smiled.</p><p>“Personal issues created by you?” Kyle scoffed.</p><p>Sebastian sighed. “I do not control the decisions of business owners. You must understand that some of these businesses are also owned by foreigners like —and I certainly do not claim to influence all business decisions. If they decide to increase the price, I too am at their mercy. And I’d prefer not to retaliate, lest the Mad Dog get sent on us again.”</p><p>“Let’s cut to the chase. How much would it take for you to stand down?”</p><p>“Not everything is about money, Mr. Kyle. Isn’t that why you provided an entire free bathhouse service to the entire district?”</p><p>“You want me to shut down the shopping arcade.”</p><p>“Again, not my wishes. I do not speak for others. But right now, they are feeling very, very threatened by you. Who am I to restrain them? I am but one man.”</p><p>“Seems that I have been talking to the wrong person then. My apologies.” Kyle got up to leave, not bothering to talk any longer. It was clear that he and Sebastian would not be able to come to a compromise.</p><p>Kyle knew why Sebastian had launched an attack: the new shopping arcade was pulling in too many customers and causing the other businesses in the city to suffer. Coupled with the addition of a new transportation hub as well as a free bathhouse, the footfall was tremendous.</p><p>Landlords across the South Sector were losing their tenants as they were lured by the Golden Snake Construction with competitive rental rates and promises of increased traffic. Even local small gangs who ran a protection racket were also threatened by their food market stall owners escaping their grasp, all fleeing toward the shopping mall, selling affordable food to the poor who were already there for the free bathhouse.</p><p>Kyle already had plans to establish a cheap food market area next to the shopping mall to centralize the traffic further, increasing his power and influence. However, while he expected local business owners to be angry, he did not expect Sebastian to get involved, especially considering that the shopping arcade was nearly five districts away from where the Ardent Cretins ruled.</p><p><em>He’s threatened by the growing influence I have over the local population</em>. Kyle had been doing public projects ever since he joined—free soup kitchens, public cleanup events, and so on. He knew from centuries of crime in the Galactic Era that being in a gang meant finding a balance between the amount of good and evil done to society.</p><p>The addition of the shopping arcade was meant to make Kyle and the Seven Snakes nearly indispensable in the society of Raktor, where any attacks against them would suffer severe public backlash from the residents, who now had a taste of a higher standard of living thanks to the improved utilities and jobs provided by the gang.</p><p>However, this would not come to fruition as long as they did not have a stable supply of arcite ore. Even the black market was somehow afraid of selling directly to Kyle, forcing him to spend far more than the market price in order to get it.</p><p><em>It’s an economic war.</em></p><p>Kyle headed back to the shopping arcade, where the footfall had significantly reduced compared to the opening day. The first light-thrower show was a complete dud, causing many to lose confidence in the shopping arcade.</p><p>In the office, the rest of the Seven Snakes’ higher-ups were already discussing the situation. Keith noticed Kyle’s entry, addressing the leader immediately. “It’s not looking good, sir. Even our construction company is unable to get new building projects due to the perceived failure of the shopping arcade. Many of the lesser nobles are unwilling to give us the tender either, favoring other companies.”</p><p>Damian nodded. “It’s the same with food and water as well. The large suppliers of flour and fish are somehow refusing to supply any restaurant or stall owners under us. If we don’t solve this issue by this month, most of them are not going to renew their tenancy contract, regardless of how much footfall we have.”</p><p>“We need arcite fuel to keep up the transportation network. Forget about refueling the shopping arcade—they don’t even want to refuel our wagons regardless of where we drive to.” Monica grumbled.</p><p>Reese was clearly dejected, slumping into a chair. The first public showing of his invention had failed tremendously, causing his mood and motivation to plummet.</p><p>“The fucking Ardent Cretins need to be taken down a peg. Why can’t we do the same thing we did with the Ilysian Punks and just bloody their nose for a bit?” Niko suggested.</p><p>“Are you crazy? We might have gotten larger over the past month, but we’re nowhere close to matching the numbers the Ardent Cretins have. Hell, we might not even come out unscathed if we fought the Red Lions right now!” Damian retorted.</p><p>“Has Wrent replied to our request for commercial contracts?” Kyle asked.</p><p>“No, sir. It seems the Ardent Cretins have already gotten to them.”</p><p>“So we are truly alone in this war…” Kyle sat down at his desk, clasping his hands together as he racked his brain, formulating a quick plan.</p><p>“Let’s summarize the situation: We <em>can </em>buy what we need; however, the prices are daylight extortion. We are being isolated by everyone under the Ardent Cretins’ thumb.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Assuming we continue to buy at the current black market price we’ve been paying, we’ll run dry in less than a month.” </p><p>Keith nodded his head. “The main issue we need to tackle right now is how to get more arcite fuel. Any ideas?”</p><p>Damian raised his hand. “We could try strong-arming the companies into submission.”</p><p>“Not feasible. The Ardent Cretins would be guarding them, and I do not want to come into a physical war with them.”</p><p>“I did mention we could either look to Versia or the Culdao Peaks for sources of arcite ore; however, it would be a tough ordeal to set up a transportation route that would not be hijacked or harassed by other gangs.”</p><p>“So we’re isolated, unable to expand, and unable to trade outside the city,” Kyle summarized.</p><p>Keith squinted his eyes. “You don’t seem particularly flustered. Do you already have a plan?”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Gordon’s office was now littered with countless pieces of paper as he and Reese argued, continuously modifying a single engraving and jotting down the changes.</p><p>In the middle of the office was a dismantled light-capturer, as well as a pile of depleted arcite ore devoid of any energy.</p><p>Kyle was there too, his right hand holding a normal arcite ore while the other held a depleted one.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Arcite Ore</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A condensed form of arcia energy, stored in a solid state.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Solid arcite ore but lacking in energy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Cannot be used any longer.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>The system says that it can’t be used, but is that truly the case?</em> Kyle knew that arcite fuel generators effectively extracted the energy from such ore into a liquid form, forming arcite fuel that would then provide power in a similar fashion.</p><p>Kyle posited that it was possible to refill the ore again with arcia energy, seeing as arcia energy could be converted into other forms of energy. He just had to find the right engraving.</p><p>“Okay, let’s go over this again. The light-capturer can capture images by essentially capturing the rays reflected by them, which then exists as energy for a short period of time before the images are stored onto our reel,” Gordon explained.</p><p>“Exactly, so what we need to do is modify the engraving such that the collected light energy will be pumped into the arcite ore!” Reese nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>“So why the hell are you making the engraving bigger before we even made any modifications?!”</p><p>“Right now, the engraving is far too small to see tangible results. The amount of light energy collected is miniscule—we need a larger one to prove it works!”</p><p>While the two of them chased down a path of solar energy hinted to them by Kyle, Kyle himself was focused on finding a way to convert mechanical energy and pumping it back into the arcite ore. <em>The efficiency would be much lower, but it would be a form of regenerative fuel as well. Perhaps this would allow me to harvest wind energy as well.</em></p><p>If Kyle had his way, he would have built a partial Dyson sphere around a star or spread out a net of dark energy harvesters in deep space and be done with it, but he had to start small here.</p><p>He grabbed a copy of an arctech wagon’s mechanical shaft engraving.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Arctech Wagon’s Shaft Engraving</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The workhorse of the industrial era.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Converts arcite energy into mechanical motion with 50% efficiency.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He created a simple prototype setup where the mechanical shaft engraving could be turned continuously with a rotating handle while the engraving was trailed off to form a connection to a metal plate on which the depleted arcite ore rested.</p><p>Turning the shaft as fast as he could, the metal joints of the test setup creaked as the rotation nearly shook the frame apart. However, he could see a trickle of arcia energy being deposited back into the arcite ore. <em>It seems that the engraving is tailored in one direction. I will have to reverse-engineer it.</em></p><p>Kyle had experience with the engravings, working together with Reese and Gordon to break down the base parts. Reese brought his entire book collection of arctech design, with Kyle spending two days just reading through the books, learning how to break down the engravings into modular parts.</p><p>It wasn’t as easy as him simply duplicating the engraving like he had done in the past. All of the engravings he had done before were simple copycats of the textbook he had or a copy of what the goblin shaman had recorded in its den. He had never delved deep enough into the inner workings of an engraving.</p><p>His proficiency in arctech engraving began to grow over the days as he continuously iterated his prototype setup, trying new modifications. Every try seemed to result in failure, with the efficiency of conversion being less than 1%. <em>It’s not enough; I need a higher percentage if we are to survive this economic war!</em></p><p>A week passed, and even Gordon and Reese were starting to lose hope. Kyle had lost count after five hundred tries, simply going through the motions and continuing to tweak the engraving. As he engraved the next design iteration onto yet another metal shaft, a new system message popped up.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Title Obtained</strong>: Arcia Engraver (Intermediate)</p>

His fingers were rock-steady as he slowly etched into the surface of the metal, even and distributed. Kyle even began to feel a slight sense of disgust when he recalled the now relatively shoddy work he had done in the past.</p><p>Completing the engraving, he placed the completed metal shaft into the test setup, the mental exhaustion of working over a week already taking its toll on his brain despite the consumption of Stamina Potions. He spun the handle again, with the shaft’s engraving clearly working better and smoother.</p><p>The depleted arcite ore seemed to recover at a visible rate, though it was still not as efficient as the conversion from arcite to mechanical energy.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Mechanical Arcia Regenerator</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 52: Hierarchy</p><p>“My god, you actually did it!” Reese celebrated as he and Gordon watched Kyle demonstrate the Mechanical Arcia Regenerator. It was quite a sight to watch the Seven Snakes’ boss sweat while turning a prototype shaft.</p><p>“But the efficiency is extremely low—how are we going to find such a large source of mechanical energy in the city?” Gordon pondered.</p><p>“Perhaps we could build a waterwheel on the main river that runs through the city?”</p><p>“No way—the Ardent Cretins will never allow us to move that blatantly if they could. Also, we would have to submit a petition to Count Leon. We might have to either place it on our own buildings that we already own, or look further.”</p><p>Kyle raised his hand and stopped the conversation. “Let me worry about that part. How’s the progress on the modification of the light-capturer engraving?”</p><p>“It’s not working, sadly. I believe the concept has been implemented correctly, but there’s simply not enough light available to be concentrated on the engraving to make it even remotely feasible. Based on our calculations, we would need to cover an entire district in such engravings to even power one floor of our new bathhouse.”</p><p>Kyle looked at the dismantled light-capturer, bending over to sort through the separated parts. “Focus your efforts on concentrating the light onto the engraving itself. We can use the lens to redirect light to the engraving.”</p><p>Reese was initially perplexed before his face lit up in understanding, nodding vigorously. Gordon was still trying to figure out what Kyle was saying. “Wait, doesn’t that mean we still have to place that many concentrating mirrors around either way?”</p><p>“Yes, but making the mirrors is easier and cheaper than placing engravings that could be easily damaged by the weather all over the city.”</p><p>“Exactly! We can funnel a large area of light onto a single engraving, reducing our material cost!” Reese excitedly explained, working out a plan immediately.</p><p>The three of them got into action, planning exactly how much would be needed. Kyle picked up the prototype light-converting engraving that the two of them had been working on for the past week.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Light Arcia Convertor</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Harness the power of daylight in the palm of your hand</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Converts visible light waves to arcia energy with a 5% efficiency.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>“The efficiency of this engraving is far too low… only a few percent,” Kyle pointed out, stunning Reese.</p><p>“How do you know the efficiency of the engraving without testing it?” Reese was slightly suspicious. Even he did not know the exact percentage, and he was the one who made it in the first place.</p><p>“I can tell from the differences between my mechanical engraving and this one. Here, have a look. This specific trace is shorter and wider, reducing the amount of arcia current loss and making it more resistant to interference from other traces…”</p><p>Kyle explained the understanding that he had gleaned from the activation of his Arcia Engraver title, enlightening Reese further and distracting him from his slip-up. “You’re right, I never thought about that! And to think that I used to call myself a professor!”</p><p>“Also, you can consider modifying this part to be more lenient. Right now, it is limited to a specific band of frequency for visible light.”</p><p>“Fre… What?!” Reese’s eyes squinted once again.</p><p>“Right. Let me handle the modification of this engraving—you two work on the plan of materials needed. I will try to get the efficiency of this engraving as high as possible.”</p><p>Kyle brought the prototype to another workshop, making sure the other two could not see him. Through his practice over the course of a week of modifying the mechanical engraving, he could now pinpoint the exact parts of the engraving that could be reworked.</p><p>Specifically, he intended to rework the frequency limitations of the light converter, enabling it to catch other forms of radiation as well. <em>As long as the rest still believe that it is only converting light, I should not be throwing too many danger signs</em>.</p><p>He reworked the frequency portion of the engraving before making four more. The Arcia Engraver title gave him a 20% chance of gleaming new inspiration and raising the quality of the engraving, which then allowed him to learn more about what could be improved.</p><p>He had tried to do it multiple times with the mechanical engraving, but it seemed like there was a cap to the quality level of the engraving, so the amount of inspiration he could get was limited. It was as though the system interface had a hard limit on what improvements it could make to the engraving that Kyle worked on.</p><p>After repeating the same process on the light-converting engraving, Kyle began to get a bit frustrated as he made his hundredth one over three days. He grumbled to himself as he made the next one. <em>Wasn’t the chance supposed to be 20%? One in five? How is it possible?</em></p><p>Just as he said that in his head, the title’s effect triggered, giving a familiar surge of information to his brain and nervous system, his hands moving automatically to improve the engraving in front of him. <em>About damn time.</em></p><p>Kyle picked up the completed engraving.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Electromagnetic Arcia Convertor</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Harness the power of stars in the palm of your hand</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Converts electromagnetic radiation to arcia energy with a maximum of 67% efficiency, depending on frequency. Efficiency of 22% for visible light waves.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Not too shabby. If I could find a radioactive source…</em> Kyle began to think about the Culdao Peaks. Perhaps he could begin mining there again. He had already sent Sasha back there a month ago to handle the goblin den as she saw fit.</p><p>Niko entered the workshop, bowing to Kyle. “Sir, you called for me before?”</p><p>“I need you to bring these mechanical engravings over to the goblin den at Culdao Peaks. Make sure the wagon is protected well—the Ardent Cretins will try their hardest to cut us off as much as possible. Hand them this document as well.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>Gulak let out a relaxed sigh as it soaked into a pool of hot water. Already, the vast improvements in the quality of life had made the goblin shaman forgo any thought of leaving the den or even attempting to rebel against Kyle. <em>Would be even better if the goblin envoys from the goblin kingdom never came at all—after all, we’re at the edge of the Culdao Peaks.</em> For now, it decided to enjoy what it had.</p><p>“This… This is life,” it remarked in a soothing, relaxed voice before a sudden splash of water went right into its large nostrils, causing it to gag and sneeze.</p><p>The goblin kids laughed as they played in the common pool, splashing around in hot water powered by the new arctech engravings layered into the stone walls.</p><p>“Stop disturbing me! I’m relaxing! You’re ruining my moment!” Gulak raged and flung a handful of water back at the kids.</p><p>It expected the kids to fight back, but instead, the kids were horrified and began doggy-paddling and scrambling to the other end of the pool. “Hah! That’s right! Me shaman! You bette—”</p><p>“Gulak, what are you doing here?” A familiar female voice caused it to tense up, one that has haunted every waking moment of Gulak’s life since Kyle left.</p><p>Gulak gingerly turned around, smiling meekly as it slowly got up out of the pool. “Lady Merissa, I—”</p><p>“No excuses. Have you completed the installation of the wind converters and light converters? Have you completed the tunnel to Raktor?!”</p><p>“Yes… mostly.”</p><p>“What do you mean, mostly?! Do you think we gave you the engravings for free? Is this bathhouse for free? You got a day to fix everything up, or else I’ll tell Sasha.”</p><p>“Tunnel cannot be finished that fast! Will take at least three more months!” 	</p><p>“Better than you wasting your fucking time here. MOVE!”</p><p>Gulak tensed up even more, nodding its head vigorously. “Yes ma’am!” It quickly scampered off, completely naked. </p><p>Merissa did not care at all when she saw the wrinkled genitals on full display, having lived with the goblins for close to four months now. She sighed as she continued her rounds through the goblin den, which had been reinvented to include various modernized features. </p><p>The lights were improved, as were utilities and the sewage system. The goblins were cleaner than ever before, and none of them complained about it. However, she still had to continuously scold the goblin workers who attempted to skive at every minute, forcing her and those under her to always be on the lookout. </p><p>On top of that, she had to make sure they continued to expand the tunnels toward Raktor. Kyle did not want to have a supply chain continuously running overground, which was prone to ambush and hijacking. Right now, they had already dug a few kilometers over the past four months, though it was getting harder to ventilate the tunnels. <em>Three more months till we reach the outskirts of Raktor. We need more workers!</em></p><p>Merissa stormed back toward her office, where Feldon was already waiting for her. “When will I be able to return to Raktor? Am I not a movie star now?”</p><p>“You won’t be a movie star until we establish a proper supply route of replenished arcite ore to the city! And besides, if you entered Raktor right now without a disguise, the Violet Demons would lynch you on entry.”</p><p>Feldon was about to retort that he could act as a squatter in order to enter the city, but he knew Kyle would also find out about his departure. He could also hardly smuggle his entire family out of the goblin den, though life here had been relatively peaceful so far, save for the constant raid attempts from other gangs who were still trying to encroach on the Euria Seeds. </p><p>Before Merissa could continue scolding him, a burst of static erupted on the arctech radio mounted in the office. The bursts came in a specific pattern, causing Merissa’s eyes to light up. “Call Gringer, Gobalt, and Gulak immediately! Have them gather all the goblin warriors immediately!”</p><p>“What? I thought we were working on the supply of arcite ore?”</p><p>“Exactly! MOVE!”</p><p>The goblin den kicked into action, with the warriors forming up into groups. A few humans were embedded into their ranks, the humans being the squad leaders of the goblins.</p><p>They stood at attention at the entrance of the mine, with Gulak, Gringer and Gobalt standing at the front. The gates of the fort soon opened to reveal Sasha, who entered with slightly bloody hands gripping a struggling goblin. </p><p>The goblin was noticeably different, with a tattoo marking his affiliation with another tribe. “Ahah!” Gulak exclaimed with joy upon seeing the predicament of the goblin. </p><p>Every goblin warrior shuddered with excitement, while Feldon was still at a complete loss. “Wait, what’s happening?”</p><p>Merissa smacked the back of his head. “I covered this four days ago, you idiot! We’re annexing another goblin tribe!”</p><p>Sasha made a few hand motions, and the warriors immediately followed her out of the mine to assault the neighboring goblin den. Trained like a paramilitary organization, the human squad leaders converted the sign motions into verbal orders for the goblins that did not understand. </p><p>Over the past week, Sasha had been implementing the same strategy that Kyle used to subjugate the first goblin den by stalking and hunting the members, which left the den to forage for food. Now with a significant force backing her, she did not need to stalk as long as Kyle did, enabling her to launch an assault immediately. </p><p>It was a nearly overwhelming victory, with the new battle tactics that Kyle and Sasha had drilled into the goblins, plus the ubiquitous use of crossbows and bows, giving them an immense advantage over the enemy, who still relied on brute force tactics. </p><p>Gulak gloated as it stepped into the enemy’s den with its warriors, watching the enemy try to flee through the mining tunnels. The fighting was harsh and brutal, but the enemy goblin tribe stood no chance, even with all the traps and ambushes they set up. </p><p>Soon, the enemy goblin tribe’s warriors were diminished, resulting in the complete surrender of the tribe. Gulak stood at the top of a rock formation, speaking to the enemy goblins. “Be happy! For I am Gulak, your new shaman! Your old shaman, weak and powerless! I, Gulak, will give you happiness!”</p><p>“No!” An elderly goblin stood up in defiance, pointing its wrinkly green finger with long yellow nails toward Gulak. “You work with humans! You are no longer goblin! We see your machines! Betrayal of ancestors!”</p><p>Gulak snapped his fingers, prompting Gringer to move forward with two warriors to grab the elderly goblin, dragging it out to the front as its children and relatives screamed and tried to pull him back. The warriors smacked and beat up those who resisted, while the elderly goblin was hoisted above, next to Gulak. </p><p>Gulak grinned as he pulled out from his belt a prototype handgun, planting the tip of the barrel right into the neck of the elderly goblin, blasting the brains of the goblins out in a spectacular splatter that showered onto the screaming goblins. </p><p>“Who else? WHO ELSE?!” Gulak roared, aiming the handgun toward the crowd. They all cowered in fear, and no one dared speak out. Gulak did not see them as goblins any longer; he only saw them as new slaves. He was already celebrating at all the slave labor he could now delegate. <em>My tribe shall no longer be slaves!</em></p><p>“Good. First, it is time to work!”</p><p>Chapter 53: Ambush</p><p>Leyton breathed slowly as he lay flat under a shrub, the dense foliage masking his presence, save for a small little opening through which his eyes peered out, overlooking a sandy road long weathered by wagon wheels. </p><p>He gripped the arctech radio tightly, checking the volume dial on it. Setting it too loud might spook anyone nearby, and he couldn’t talk loudly either. His left hand remained on a military-grade repeater carbine next to him as he continued observing any movements. </p><p>Suddenly, a loud roaring sound was heard next to him, causing him to tense up immediately. He soon realized it was the snoring of his partner, who was dozing off while both hands were still holding onto the rifle. </p><p>“Idiot, wake up!” Leyton hissed softly. “The fucking Seven Snakes will be coming anytime soon!”</p><p>The partner did not wake up until Leyton smacked the back of his head, jolting him awake. “What, where?! Are they here?!” he asked frantically, his eyes darting around.</p><p>“Shut up! If Gray finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job, you can forget about getting promoted next year.” </p><p>The partner rubbed the back of his head gingerly, wincing slightly as he relaxed. “Pah, you really believe the spiel Sebastian gives every year? They won’t promote us—they need foot soldiers like us to do the dirty work. Ain’t complaining; the pay’s pretty good, and look at the slick weapons they gave us!”</p><p>Leyton didn’t retort, knowing that there was truth to what his partner was saying. It’s been a while since they left the slums three years ago to join the Ardent Cretins. Back then, their naïve eyes and attitude made them feel like they were kings of the world. Until they met the higher-ups and realized they never even made a dent in the social ladder, barely even moving up a rung. </p><p>Still, Leyton would not return to the slums willingly. He was far too addicted to the standard of living of a gang associate. That was exactly why they were here. </p><p>Suddenly, the distinctive sound of an arctech wagon began to loom from the path coming down from Culdao Peaks Town. The partner grinned as he clenched his rifle tighter, aiming down the iron sights, but Leyton didn’t move yet, observing with his keen eyes. </p><p>The wagon soon came into clear view, chugging along slowly as it rattled down the sandy gravel path, bouncing with each pebble the wheels rolled over. The partner took aim but was blocked by Leyton quickly. “Stop, don’t shoot yet!”</p><p>“What? Why? I thought we were supposed to shoot!”</p><p>“Not at every wagon that comes by, you idiot! We only want the Seven Snakes one—you want to be the reason we start a war with the Violet Demons?!” Leyton pointed to the edge of the wagon, which had a cryptic rune indicating that the merchant operating the wagon was under the protection of the Violet Demons. </p><p>“Right… Sorry.” The partner sheepishly smiled. </p><p>Leyton turned on his arctech radio, speaking quietly into the receiver, “One sinner heading to Raktor.”</p><p>[Copy that. Any signs of snakes?]</p><p>“No sir, nothing south.”</p><p>[Roger. Keep looking.]</p><p> Leyton heaved a sigh of relief as he watched the wagon go past before scowling at his partner. “Next time, wait for me to make the call first, all right?!”</p><p>“All right, all right! I’m sor—”</p><p>Leyton quickly covered his partner’s mouth, shutting him up. “Shut up and listen. You hear that?”</p><p>The partner’s eyes widened with confusion, trying to hear as well. After a brief moment, he shook his head. He grabbed Leyton’s hand and got it off his mouth, spitting out a glob of saliva. “What are you hearing?”</p><p>Leyton glanced around his surroundings, looking up at the tree branches. “It sounded like footsteps of humans…”</p><p>“Really?” The partner immediately tensed up, looking all around them too. He trusted Leyton’s instincts, which was why they were paired as a spotter and a gunner duo in the first place. </p><p>However, the sound of an arctech wagon began to distract them and dominate the environment, following the same sandy road. This time, Leyton noticed no markings on the exterior of the wagon at all. </p><p>“Are we clear to shoot?” the partner asked hastily. </p><p>“Wait…” Leyton waited for the wagon to go past them before he checked the back. The familiar glow of arcite ore glinted blue through the seams of the cloth at the back. “Shoot! Shoot the wheels!”</p><p>The partner fired a round, cocking his gun and firing another. The two shots were spot on, hitting the spoke of the wheel and causing it to dent. The wobbling of the wheel caused the wagon to falter and skid off the road, slamming right into a tree trunk far away from the duo. </p><p>“Sir, snakes with blue spotted. Wagon down. Requesting hit.”</p><p>[Good work. Moving in. Pincer from the back.]</p><p>“Yes, sir. Come on; we need to make sure no one makes it out alive.” Leyton and his partner rose to their feet, helping each other up.</p><p>However, before they could even stand up straight, five shots of a handgun were fired toward the partner. The man’s armor flared to life, firing point defense projectiles to block the shots, but two made it through and nailed him in the chest and neck, causing him to scream in a gurgle of blood as he fell over. </p><p>Leyton’s training kicked in, and he immediately dived for cover behind a tree trunk as he readied his own rifle, cocking it. He peeked out from the side, trying to spot who was shooting at him, but the forest was suddenly quiet, as though nothing had happened. </p><p><em>Shit, I have to warn the others!</em> Before Leyton could turn on the arctech radio again, a female figure dropped down from the tree branches above him, landing right in front of him. Leyton yelped as his vision was overwhelmed by an armored knee that smashed his nose right and slammed his head against the tree trunk. </p><p>His world spun as he slumped to the floor, dizzy from the concussive impact, while the female figure whistled with her free hand as the other held a prototype handgun. Leyton’s eyes widened as he recognized the handguns. <em>The ones circulating in the black market a month ago? Weren’t all of them destroyed? </em></p><p>At the command of the whistle, three goblins sprinted over, quickly grabbing Leyton and the dying Ardent Cretins member. The duo was hauled off deeper into the forest. </p><p>Back at the road, the front of the wagon was smashed in as though the metal itself had wrapped around the tree trunk. Smoke rose from the machine while five armed soldiers appeared from the woods, each wielding military-grade guns and armor. </p><p>“Clear the area. Where’s the driver?” the leader asked as one of the soldiers moved up and broke the door to the driver’s seat open. </p><p>“Sir, there’s no one inside! They must have rigged it to drive straight!”</p><p>The five soldiers immediately tensed up, holding their repeaters at the ready. “Retreat. We’ve been compromised.”</p><p>“Sir, what about Leyton?”</p><p>“He’s probably been captured already. Move!”</p><p>The five soldiers quickly moved through the forest away from the main road, continuously checking behind their backs. The leader began to spot signs of goblins stalking them from their left, leaping through the trees from branch to branch. “Fire a few shots in their direction! Scare them back!”</p><p>As they raised their repeaters to aim to the left, Sasha and the other goblins struck from the right, firing at them. Sasha emptied the entire clip of the handgun into one soldier, overwhelming his point defense engraving and killing him on the spot. </p><p>The sheer number of arrows also caused the point defense engravings to be powered down, enabling the goblins to attack with crossbows and bows. </p><p>Grunting as he hefted his repeater, the leader aimed with pinpoint precision, sniping the heads of the goblins, which resulted in five confirmed kills. After he had fired his twentieth shot, he pulled the trigger again to no effect, prompting him to reach for his belt for the next magazine. </p><p>In that split moment, Sasha sprinted toward him, forcing him to use both hands on his rifle to block a punch from Sasha’s glowing right hand. The engraving on her hand boosted the force imparted, smashing the wooden cover of the repeater and bending the metal barrel hidden within. </p><p>The leader dropped the repeater immediately and threw a punch at Sasha, who blocked it with her left arm as she took a step back to avoid tripping on the dropped repeater, before lunging again with a kick from the right, nailing the leader right in the waist. </p><p>Sasha winced from the pain erupting from her shin that had smashed into the military armor, allowing the leader to recover and retrieve a small knife out, stabbing and slicing toward the woman. </p><p>“Men! Split up!” the leader roared, still intending to retreat. However, he could see from his peripheral vision that all his soldiers had already been knocked out by the sheer number of goblins. He could see from the branches that there were nearly fifty of those little green monsters.</p><p>“Shit!” the leader cursed as he tried to sprint away, only for a barrage of arrows to be fired toward him, piercing his flesh from behind and eliciting a scream of pain. </p><p>Sasha slowly walked up to the injured leader, bent over to grab him by the collar, and lifted him up. She inspected the military armor, noticing that it was similar to the ones the Seven Snakes had hijacked from the Ilysian Punks. <em>This… could be a problem. </em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Haui smiled as he looked around his new store, right smack in the middle of the shopping center facing the front lobby. The workers were busy setting up the shelves to display all sorts of potions, while he pointed out where some of the equipment should be placed in the back room.</p><p>“Liking your new store?” Kyle asked as he entered, shaking hands with Haui.</p><p>“I am, indeed. Sometimes, I wonder why I have been hiding in that dodgy old little hut for such a long time.”</p><p>“But you’re not giving it up yet.”</p><p>“Of course. A man of my intellect can surely handle two stores, can’t he? I do have a few apprentices under me that can handle the more mediocre potions and their production.”</p><p>“I was under the impression you were against selling potions at a cheaper rate to the… common folk.”</p><p>“Let’s just say you now have enough economic power to ‘slightly’ resist the Alchemists’ Guild. There is merit to sheer quantity after all,” Haui replied. “I’ve put in an official proposal for this store. It is still currently undergoing vetting. With your recent accomplishments, I’m sure this store will be licensed, though do be prepared to pay certain taxes to the guild. Through me, of course.”</p><p>Kyle nodded in agreement. He had specifically invited Haui to set up a potion store here, with the potions aimed at being sold at a more affordable price than his previous store. The reason why Kyle could not outright sell the potions was that he did not have a license from the Alchemists’ Guild.</p><p>Thus, Haui was the simple solution. With this, Kyle would have yet another reason for people to come to the shopping center, boosting the footfall yet again. By creating as many amenities in one place as possible, he could reinvent the entire nearby area as an economic hub under his control. </p><p>“I noticed you had a few issues with arcite fuel recently. Will I have to deal with intermittent outages?”</p><p>“The arcite fuel issues are sorted right now. However, there is still the issue of traders not willing to sell basic goods such as food and ingredients to us.”</p><p>“I can solve that easily.” Haui smiled. “There may be black market traders who are afraid of earning the ire of the Ardent Cretins, but there will also be enemies who are more than willing to see the Ardent Cretins fall. And also those who just want money regardless.”</p><p>“Then I thank you in advance.” Kyle was aware of Haui’s deep network and ties to the underground. After all, Haui brewed all sorts of poison for assassinations and hitjobs—such ingredients would not be easy to get legally. </p><p>“Perhaps you can thank me with a bigger tithe of your profits from the potion business. I am handling the taxes for the Alchemists’ Guild, after all.”</p><p>“Your tenancy here is already free.”</p><p>“Well, it was still worth a try.”</p><p>Kyle bid farewell to Haui, walking around the shopping arcade. The roof of the building was now plastered with concentrating mirrors, while a consistent flow of arcite ore from the Culdao Peaks was guarded by Monica and other associates. Depleted ore was then funneled to the goblin den and to a few light converters placed around the districts they owned, with Gordon providing the leftovers from the factory production lines. </p><p>The supply chain was coming together, and with Haui now helping him to solve the other issues, the shopping arcade was now back in full swing. Now that they were in the clear, able to survive without relying too much on external help, his eyes were set on the companies that had previously refused to sell to him.</p><p><em>You wanted an economic war? You’re going to get one.</em></p><p>Chapter 54: Retribution</p><p>“Berth 9, wagon arrived ten in the morning. Attacked by small-time thugs, with light damage to its exterior. The driver says that a restaurant was doing roadworks that blocked half of the road. They are really pulling out all the stops this time,” Monica reported as she walked with Kyle and Keith through the basement, where the main logistics for the shopping arcade were handled. </p><p>The basement was filled with wagons unloading food and ingredients, as well as arcite ore from the Culdao Peaks operation. Kyle noticed some of the wagons had severe dents on the side, as well as one whose wheel had been completely torn off, having to be towed in. </p><p>“So first they raised the prices to extravagant amounts, and now they are trying to obstruct our deliveries.” Keith shook his head as he entered the administrative office, checking on the books while the clerks frantically jotted down the delivery times. Each of them reported the times and events to a manager, who was marking the points in the city where the deliveries were attacked. </p><p>“We’ve already lost two wagons today just from hijacking. Niko has been working hard putting guards on each of the wagons, but the manpower is getting intensive.” Monica grumbled as she looked at the map. The majority of deliveries were routed through Ardent Cretins’ territory, being the shortest and quickest way out of the city. The Seven Snakes’ three districts were like an island in a sea of enemies.</p><p>“I understand,” Kyle replied as he observed the patterns of delivery hits. “The hits seem to be occurring in the same areas all the time. They have formed a net.” It was a bit of an issue—the arcite ore that was replenished by the new renewable energy setups at the Culdao Peaks was theoretically illegal. </p><p>Kyle could hardly call in the enforcers to cover it, seeing as his arcite ore would be taxed. Furthermore, word would spread among the nobility that a new arcite ore mine would be found, which would jeopardize his entire goblin operation. Gulak certainly would not be happy. </p><p>“Any hits done by the Ardent Cretins?”</p><p>“No. Every hit seems to be done by hired thugs. It seems the Ardent Cretins are being especially careful.” Keith shook his head. </p><p>“Or it is really the group of companies opposing us that are really having a beef,” Monica pointed out. “The patterns seem more like a loosely organized attempt at disruption than a centralized force. I suspect the companies are working alone for various reasons.”</p><p>“Who are the companies so far?”</p><p>Keith shrugged. “Well, just about every food supplier in the South Sector has refused to do business with us. Thanks to Haui’s connection, we’re buying them from the North Sector now, but they still have a chance of getting intercepted in the Ardent Cretins’ territory.”</p><p>“Okay. Call Damian and Guang Hwa in. It’s time for some payback.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>“Goddammit! Not again!” Solomon crushed the slip of paper in his hand into a small ball as he tossed it into a basket at the corner of his office. The arctech radio on his table seemed to gloat at him as it continued to rattle off, the announcer’s voice filling the room. </p><p>[And it looks like it’s lights out for Team Rising Stars, who unfortunately have just suffered a severe arctech malfunction. This might very well be the end of their championship run!] </p><p><em>Fuck! I put half my savings on this bet!</em> Solomon cursed under his breath. He quickly took out his accounting book, flipping through quickly and checking the profits. His pudgy finger traced down the column of expenses, his face scowling. </p><p>“Secretary!” he roared as he stormed out of his office, frightening the administrative clerks right outside. He marched up to a scrawny man’s table, his bulky build intimidating the latter into a quivering mess. </p><p>“Boss, I didn’t do anything wrong! It wasn’t my fault!”</p><p>“Huh? What are you talking about?”</p><p>“You’re angry about the failed hijacking yesterday, right?”</p><p>“What on earth are you saying? I’m angry about the expenses on amenities for the workers! Why is there a three hundred thousand rakel cost for the fucking renovations!”</p><p>“But boss, last week you said to the workers that you wanted to improve the living standards of their dormitory—”</p><p>“I want you to reverse it. Immediately!”</p><p>“The backlas—”</p><p>“I don’t care about the backlash from the workers. Cancel it immediately!” Solomon grumbled as he walked out of the office onto a catwalk overlooking a factory where potatoes were being manually processed by thousands of workers. </p><p>There were not many big specialized machines on the factory floor for mass-stripping or cleaning. Instead, the workers washed and peeled the potatoes to prepare them for packing before storing them away in arctech cooler boxes to keep them fresh longer. The largest machine that Solomon had purchased was a conveyor belt, as the cost of labor in Raktor was extremely low due to the extreme poverty many of the slum dwellers faced. </p><p>Solomon walked along the catwalk to another office, where a frustrated subordinate was arguing on the phone. “If you don’t accept the new contract, you can forget about getting your food ever again in the South Sector!”</p><p>[I’ll take my chances with the Seven Snakes—they seem to be doing pretty well with the shopping arcade. Goodbye, cocksucker.] The restaurant owner on the other end hung up, causing the subordinate to be frustrated and the veins on his forehead nearly popping. </p><p>“What’s going on? Why did he cancel the contract?” Solomon interrupted the subordinate’s solo tantrum show, prompting the man to regain his senses and bow to his superior, Solomon himself, quickly. </p><p>“Uhh, sir, remember how we talked about sanctioning any businesses related to the Seven Snakes?”</p><p>“Yeah? What about it? What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Well, it’s already been two weeks since we started, but the shopping arcade hasn’t collapsed.”</p><p>“I know. That’s why we’ve been targeting their deliveries, haven’t we?”</p><p>“Yes, but the footfall there is immense—it’s drawing away customers that would have normally gone to the restaurants we supply!”</p><p>Solomon’s face twitched slightly. “That’s exactly why we imposed the sanctions: to prevent that exact scenario from happening!”</p><p>“Sir, it’s already happening. Today alone, we just lost five restaurants. They are all relocating to the Seven Snakes district area.”</p><p>“Fucking twats, get some hired thugs to beat them up!”</p><p>“That’s what I tried to do yesterday, but our hired thugs got beaten up instead by the Seven Snakes! The restaurants are being treated like VIPs!”</p><p>Solomon did not reply just yet, pondering as he paced the room, looking at the piles of canceled supply contracts. <em>First, I lose half of my savings, then I lose my customers. The sanctions were supposed to bring money, not make us crash like this!</em></p><p>“So what do you suggest?” Solomon asked. “You must have a plan in mind.”</p><p>“I believe the only way out of this is to work with the Seven Snakes.”</p><p>“ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?! Imagine the humiliation I will have to face for being a traitor to the other companies!”</p><p>“Yes, but think about it! Based on our current rate, we’re operating at a loss. We won’t be able to survive the month!” the subordinate retorted. “Especially considering you just blew half of our cash. Don’t think I don’t know you used the factory funds to bet on the races.”</p><p>Solomon wanted to retort but calmed himself down. He had to think rationally. <em>He’s right. At the rate at which we’re going, the sanctions are unsustainable. But being a turncoat is even worse… or is it?</em></p><p>“Send a letter to the Seven Snakes asking for parley. If we are the first to turn over, the Seven Snakes must be more than willing to sign a beneficial contract with us.” </p><p>The subordinate immediately got to work, quickly drafting up a letter. Solomon was about to head back to his personal office when he suddenly heard a commotion from the factory floor—a loud clamor. <em>What the fuck is going on?</em></p><p>“Comrades! How long will you toil under an ungrateful master? How long will you suffer and work aimlessly, only to be thrown to the side once your limbs have dried out? How long?”</p><p>An agitator dressed just like them was speaking out. The workers were still slightly confused by the new guy, who had just been hired the day before. <em>Wasn’t he a newbie? Why is he standing on three crates?</em></p><p>However, the words he spoke resonated deeply with many of the workers’ hearts, and a sense of disenchantment surrounded them. “High above you, the owner of this factory grins down at you, thinking of all of you as simple sheep, mindless and obedient!”</p><p>“But the boss said last week he was going to renovate the dormito—”</p><p>“Is that true? Are you sure? Do not believe the lies of the owners unless you see and hear them for yourself! Behold, the secretary of the boss himself!” The agitator motioned with his hand, prompting a burly partner to drag forward the secretary, captured during his toilet break. </p><p>“What the fuck?! SECURITY!” Solomon yelled at the top of his lungs, sprinting as fast as his obese body would allow him to, heading down to the factory floor. </p><p>The panicking secretary immediately nodded his head as he was lifted up high by one hand, screaming out in fear, “It’s true! The boss just canceled the renovation!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Why? He just promised us last week?”</p><p>“What the fuck is this? I promised my family we would have a nicer room to move into!”</p><p>The workers began to get more agitated, while the factory guards began to charge toward the agitator. “Don’t let those two fuckers get away!” Solomon roared. </p><p>“Damian, run!” Guang Hwa screamed, quickly sprinting away. Damian was a bit astounded at the speed with which Guang Hwa fled. He had pegged him for a man with minimal physical capabilities. <em>When it comes to saving his own skin, he sure can put in the work. </em></p><p>Damian was not as fast as Guang Hwa, getting tangled up in a fight with the factory guards, who swung batons at him. Activating his Harden engraving, he shrugged off all the attacks, delivering a basic one-two punch to each of them, knocking them out cold. </p><p>Ever since Keith had been kidnapped, Damian had been tirelessly working his ass off, improving his arcia energy flow as well as synchronizing his attack with his new engraving skills. He built himself into a much more muscular build, going above and beyond in his training routine. As it stood right now, he could flip an arctech wagon if he wanted to.</p><p>With the guards knocked out, Damian easily made his escape, running in a separate direction from Guang Hwa. </p><p>Solomon was enraged, shouting and screaming at the workers, “What are you numbskulls doing!? Go and chase them!”</p><p>Instead of listening, the workers all began to converge on Solomon, their eyes filled with rage. </p><p>“Where’s the dormitory renovation you promised us?!”</p><p>“What did you do with the money?”</p><p>“It’s none of your business! Back off now! Otherwise, you won’t have a job!” Solomon threatened, but it fell on deaf ears as the workers started to physically grab him. </p><p>“Stop dodging the question!” One of the workers grabbed Solomon by the collar before being quickly slapped away onto the ground by him. </p><p>“You dare touch me?! ME?! I AM YOU—” Before Solomon could enter his final form, the workers all began to attack him, throwing punches, kicks, and potatoes from afar. </p><p>Solomon cowered and rolled on the floor, scampering away from the angry horde of workers as he tried to escape the factory. <em>Fuck, I can’t die here!</em> </p><p>The workers began to trash the factory, stealing whatever valuable parts there were from the nearby machinery. Some of the more desperate workers began hauling sacks of arcite ore out of the factory, hoping to make a quick buck. </p><p><em>My assets! How am I going to repay my debts now?</em> Solomon nearly cried to himself as he limped out of the factory, hearing the loud bangs and explosions behind. The tears he shed were not for the administrative clerks and subordinates being beaten up by the workers, but for the amount of loans he had taken out to build the factory in the first place. </p><p><em>It’s no problem. I’m sure the Ardent Cretins will lend me more money! I just have to talk to Sebastian, and everything will be right as—</em> </p><p>As soon as he stepped out onto the street, Solomon was grabbed by the collar for the second time that day. He found himself surrounded by five Seven Snakes associates who stared daggers at him. </p><p>Kyle smiled as he lifted Solomon up with one hand despite the man’s weight, causing his stubby legs to dangle. “You!?” Solomon was shocked. </p><p>“Hello, dear factory owner. You seem to be in trouble. Perhaps the Seven Snakes can be of assistance?”</p><p>Chapter 55: Undercurrents</p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>“Why hasn’t the shopping arcade been taken over yet?! They should be bankrupt by now!” The chairman tapped the table as his fingernails rasped against the hardwood. </p><p>A wave of murmurs spread around the table, where more than two dozen business owners sat. “I say it’s due to us letting incompetent twats into the prestigious South Sector Business Owner Union of Raktor. Unable to even enforce a simple sanction against an uppity upstart, pah!” An older gentleman grumbled as he chewed vigorously. Before long, he hacked out a large glob of spit tainted with crushed leaves into a spit bowl.</p><p>“Indeed! Back in my time, we would just hit every store and shop they owned, no questions asked. Why, we used to burn down entire villages just to kill the supply chains!” another elder chimed in, nodding vigorously.</p><p>“Shut up, old fart! The enforcers might be looking the other way right now, but if we go that far, who knows if the Mad Dog will be unleashed on us.”</p><p>A visible shudder spread through the business owners. The tale of the Mad Dog had spread far and wide through the South Sector, her undying thirst for violence insatiable. Many saw her brutality as a much-needed reprieve from the stranglehold that the gangs held over the city. </p><p>But for the owners, they knew that if they were caught and exposed, there would be no mercy from her. “I heard she had been posted to the West Sector.”</p><p>“Ah, no doubt to keep the two major gangs under control. Knowing that she’s far away brings me relief.”</p><p>“Still, the Seven Snakes are on very good terms with the enforcers. Let’s not give them any ammunition with which to charge us.”</p><p>The chairman gritted his teeth. “All this useless bickering won’t do us any good! I want to know how to take down the Seven Snakes, and fast!”</p><p>The owners all nodded, grim expressions plastered on their faces. It had been three long weeks of continuous refusal to supply any business of the Seven Snakes, harassing other smaller companies into siding with the union instead, and even hiring thugs to disrupt the deliveries. </p><p>“We need to put more effort into forming a blockade. We must be united in this aspect; otherwise, just hijacking a few deliveries here and there is not going to make a dent in their finances!”</p><p>Someone scoffed from across the table. “United? How dare you say ‘united’ when I’ve personally seen thugs hired by Solomon hijacking my delivery wagon?” </p><p>Solomon was startled, glancing around rapidly in confusion. “Me? I haven’t hired any thugs in a week!”</p><p>“Don’t bullshit me! If anything, I think that you are working as a double agent!” The rival owner continued to accuse Solomon. </p><p>The eyebrow on Solomon’s face twitched slightly. “You dare accuse me?! I think it’s you who incited my workers to revolt against me just last week!”</p><p>As the two bickered on the table, a sense of discord began to spread through the other owners. “Speaking of that, Deliah, I’ve noticed you’ve begun to poach my farmers,” a sturdy man accused a well-dressed lady in a frill blue Victorian-style dress.</p><p>The lady smirked, unfolding a quaint blue oriental fan and hiding her face. “Whatever do you mean? I simply offered them a better price.”</p><p>“How dare you? The situation is already as bad as it is, with many businesses moving over to the Seven Snakes’ district! Why are you contesting me?!”</p><p>“Just because we’re in a union does not mean that it’s a fixed market, darling. Supply and demand. Haven’t you learned that when you failed in Tryas?”</p><p>“You…!”</p><p>“ENOUGH!” The chairman slammed the table, interrupting the bickering occurring between the owners. “There is no reason to compete with each other! If we can take down the Seven Snakes, there’ll be a bigger pie for all of us to share!”</p><p>The owners grumbled among themselves, nodding non committedly. The cracks between the owners were starting to show, fueled by the accusations lobbied at each other. </p><p>Solomon gave a slight wink to his rival, who winked back in return. They had planned this from the start, planning to draw out the hidden actions that each company had actually been doing to each other. Both of them were already working for Kyle. </p><p>The union was made up of a loose gathering of companies, but they were primarily competitors with each other. The chairman tried to convince them to ride it out for a while longer before they finally dispersed. He sighed to himself, watching the owners leave the meeting hall, with only one person remaining on the other end of the long table. </p><p>The person nodded his head at the chairman, permitting him to approach. “I hope you have labeled those who were clearly incompetent. Many of their businesses are about to falter from such a simple economic sanction of just three weeks. What a rubbish business model,” the person remarked.</p><p>The chairman wiped his forehead, his hand clearly trembling. “Sebastian, I don’t think we can hold the sanctions for another month. My businesses may be stable for now, but eventually, the Seven Snakes will come to dominate.”</p><p>“I know.” Sebastian smiled gently as he leaned back into his chair. “I never expected Kyle to give up that easily.”</p><p>“What?!” The chairman was stunned. “Then what was the point of all of this?!”</p><p>“To weed out the incompetent among us. To strengthen the South Sector as a whole. To buy time. To prepare. There are plenty of reasons, chairman.” Sebastian took out three rolls of blueprints, laying them out on the table. </p><p>The chairman walked over to take a look, gasping. “This… This is the construction blueprints from the Seven Snakes for the shopping arcade! How did you get your hands on it?”</p><p>“Kyle would like to believe his gang is watertight. Everyone has a price, do they not? Your sanction has bought enough time for me to build my own rival shopping arcade, with a few improvements. Naturally, you will have a share and first dibs on any property development next to it.”</p><p>Sebastian had never planned to implement a long-term economic sanction—it was simply to put enough pressure on the Seven Snakes and stall their growth while the Ardent Cretins reverse-engineered the design of the shopping arcade. Though, he would not mind if he held it longer, just so he made sure he was on top.</p><p>The chairman’s previously confused face slowly turned into the expression of a man who had nailed a deal. “I understand, Sebastian. The longer the sanction…”</p><p>“The higher chance you have to knock out your competitors within the union itself. Absorb those who fall to the wayside or are unable to handle the economic pressure. Those that survive will have proven their business model; the rest will be subservient to you. Consolidation at its finest.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Reese whistled to himself as he slid his hand over the varnished table, glistening with a smooth, glossy surface. He grinned to himself as he looked around the posh office, complete with an overview of the streets outside through transparent glass walls.</p><p>Ever since he established the Silver Snake Productions company with Kyle, his lifestyle has only been on the up and up. His invention of the light-capturer and the light-thrower was the turning point for all of this to happen.</p><p>His little daughter laughed happily as she played around with her assigned Seven Snakes bodyguard, the two of them running around the room. Reese smiled as he recalled how close he had been to losing it all due to the kidnapping. It was only thanks to Kyle that he had managed to survive. </p><p>Though he had suspicions that Kyle had been the one who put out the kidnapping contract in the first place… <em>Maybe it was all a ploy to simply foster a sense of respect and loyalty in me.</em></p><p>That didn’t matter to him as much anymore, having gotten used to the way the Seven Snakes were running things, both legally and illegally. He was only human, after all—he would do anything to see his little girl well-fed and treated. <em>Oh, and a bit of luxury for myself doesn’t hurt.</em> </p><p>An employee of the company entered meekly, bowing to Reese as her eyes were a bit confused by the burly bodyguard chasing the little daughter slowly around the room. “Sir, the payment for the rental has come in, but they say they will require an extension in the contract. They have provided the additional payment for the extension as well.”</p><p>“Which one?”</p><p>“The anonymous buyer from three days ago.”</p><p>Reese nodded his head in understanding. “Hmm, as long as they paid. Any ideas what the buyer was using it for?” </p><p>Part of the idea behind renting out the equipment was to spy on the buyers and figure out what they were using the devices for. Sometimes it was to film an extravagant wedding at the bequest of a rich baroness from another city; other times, it was an inspired movie-maker wanting to make an independent show. </p><p>This allowed Kyle and Reese to monitor the growing interest and spread of the light-thrower industry, or, as Kyle called it, the “media” industry. This would help them stay ahead of the competition. </p><p>“No, sir. The buyer was prepared and shook off the observers almost immediately.”</p><p><em>Suspicious…</em> Reese pondered a while before dismissing the subordinate. This was the first anonymous buyer they had, making him wonder what they were using it for. <em>Reverse-engineering? It won’t be possible with the failsafe that Kyle and I have implemented.</em></p><p>The laughter of his daughter shook him out of deep thought, making him smile. <em>Money is money. </em></p><p>Just as he was about to head over to play with his daughter as well, Kyle entered the office, immediately motioning to the bodyguard to leave the room. </p><p>“We need to work together to make a degraded version of the engravings.”</p><p>Reese had learned a lot of new terms and concepts over his time with the Seven Snakes, but Kyle’s words nearly threw him for a loop.</p><p>“What?! You want to make the engravings worse?” Reese was appalled by the very notion Kyle had put forth. He had spent his entire life improving engravings—was he just supposed to sabotage them now?</p><p>“Relax. I never said we were degrading our own products—rather, we will be creating a less efficient version of it.”</p><p>“But why?! Are you intentionally going to create bad products to sell to our customers? That would hurt our reputation.”</p><p>Kyle fumed slightly, prompting Reese to stop arguing and let his superior explain. Regardless of Reese’s current financial status, Kyle still intimidated him. Reese was well aware that Kyle could easily kill him if he truly wanted to. </p><p>“You understand that right now, the light-capturer and light-thrower engravings are company secrets, held only by the two of us, correct?”</p><p>“Yes. That is why we vet every buyer and their background to trace if the technology is being reverse-engineered. I also engrave every single one of them manually myself.”</p><p>It was the only way to control the spread of technology—Kyle did not trust Gordon’s factory workers to be immune to bribery or extortion, potentially leaking details of a mass production process. It was better to keep the supply low and subsequently raise the rental prices. </p><p>Reese thought quickly about why Kyle wanted a degraded version of the engraving, his face lighting up in understanding. “I get it now! This is ingenious! When’s the deadline?”</p><p>“Tonight.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>A Seven Snakes associate gingerly adjusted his sleeves, pulling his right sleeve back to check the time. He leaned against an arctech wagon parked in an inconspicuous alleyway, far away from the prying eyes of the pedestrians who filled the streets. </p><p>He tapped his foot impatiently, constantly checking the time on his watch as he glanced down the decrepit path. A loud clang was heard, causing him to jump in fright as a rat scampered across the alleyway, dashing between piles of trash and depleted arcite ore. </p><p>“Seriously, why am I always the one taking all this risk!” the associate complained, scratching his bald head furiously and trying to soothe an itch on the back of his neck. </p><p>He waited a few more minutes before finally getting impatient and grumbling to himself. “Fucking thugs. Can’t even keep to a time.” He opened the driver’s door, only to hear the distinctive click of an arctech pistol whirring. The associate gulped instinctively, raising his arms in surrender as he turned around slowly, coming face-to-face with a three-man group. </p><p>Two bodyguards carrying thick briefcases flanked a lanky businessman, the most distinctive part of his snazzy suit being the pink feather in his cap and the purple handkerchief in his breast pocket, fine embroidery lining its edges.</p><p>“Took you long enough, eh?” The associate smiled, having already expected them, while the two bodyguards moved forward around him, checking if there was anyone else in the wagon. </p><p>“All clear, sir.” One of the bodyguards spoke to the lanky businessman, who grinned widely, clearing his throat. </p><p>“Guang Hwa, president of the Golden Snake Constructions. Or should I say, Brother Long Hua? The instigator of the most recent religious protest, if I recall.”</p><p>“It wasn’t a religious protest, but a call to freedom,” Guang Hwa scoffed. </p><p>“Feisty. Now, where are the goods?”</p><p>“All right here, in the wagon. Where’s the money?”</p><p>“Hahaha! Who knew that the great Kyle would be so easily taken down by a greedy subordinate? I feel sorry for him recruiting you to be the spokesperson.”</p><p>Guang Hwa scowled, reaching his left hand down to undo a button near his neck, revealing a metal choker that ran right around his neck. The bodyguards immediately stepped forward to check the engravings on the neck, ensuring that it was not a tracker engraving. </p><p>The lanky businessman was amused and clearly intrigued. “You two, search the interior of the wagon and make sure our friend here was not followed.” </p><p>He took a step toward Guang Hwa, examining him. “Interesting. It is quite funny to see the head of a prominent Golden Snake Construction wearing such a thing. However, the design is indeed unique. Perhaps you might be interested in selling it to me as well?”</p><p>“Fuck you, if this thing goes off, my head goes with it.”</p><p>“It is a tough choice, but it is one that I am willing to make.” </p><p>“Shut up. Where’s the money?”</p><p>“Relax. You will get it once you are clear.” </p><p>The bodyguards checked every nook and cranny of the arctech wagon, examining even the spokes of the wheels for any hidden devices or engravings. </p><p>“So, who’s the buyer on the other end?” Guang Hwa asked.</p><p>“Keep asking questions like that, and I may be inclined to think you are an enforcer mole.”</p><p>“Except I already sold you the blueprints for the construction before. Went rather well, in my opinion.”</p><p>“A fine deal indeed.” The lanky businessman scratched his chin. </p><p>“This deal would be even better for you, would it not? I can’t imagine any other information dealer on the black market getting such a catch as this. You’ll be the talk of the town for a while.”</p><p>“Surprisingly cognizant for a slave.” The information dealer neither denied nor confirmed Guang Hwa’s comment. </p><p>[Sir, no signs of the Seven Snakes or any enforcers nearby.] An arctech radio on the belt of the dealer crackled to life. The bodyguards soon exited the wagon, nodding their heads to indicate that it was clear of booby traps. </p><p>The dealer walked to the back of the wagon, lifting the cloth that covered them. Arranged in a haphazard fashion was one copy of nearly everything that the Seven Snakes had innovated for the construction of the shopping arcade, including a complete light-capturer and light-thrower at the back. </p><p>“Jackpot. This will fetch an extremely high price.” The dealer couldn’t help grinning to himself as he stepped into the back of the wagon, looking around intently before turning to snarl at Guang Hwa. “I don’t see any manuals or notes here—you promised to bring whatever documentation they had as well.”</p><p>“I’m just a spokesperson—you think I would know which exact piece of paper to bring? It was already hard enough for me to get my hands on these devices,” Guang Hwa complained. </p><p>The dealer bent over to activate the light-thrower, which churned and projected a still image of the Silver Snakes Productions’ logo. “Seems to be in working order. You two, drive this wagon off and do a switch in the next district. Split it up into three separate wagons before converging, got it? Safehouses B and D.”</p><p>The bodyguards nodded, entering the driver’s seat, much to the confusion of Guang Hwa. “Hey, why are you driving off my wagon? How the hell am I supposed to get back? The Seven Snakes will find out and—”</p><p>“Don’t you worry about that. I brought more friends to take care of that.” </p><p>Two more men walked into the alleyway, obviously hired thugs under the dealer’s command. Guang Hwa’s eyes narrowed, knowing what was happening immediately. “You! You promised me five million rakels!”</p><p>“And? Don’t you know the rules of Raktor? A contract can only be enforced by the strength of both parties. No one is on your side; no one even knows we signed the contract. Even if I break it, no one is going to intervene for you, not even the Seven Snakes. After all, you betrayed them, didn’t you?”</p><p>“Bitch, if I survive, I’ll tell the entire world of your—”</p><p>“That’s if you survive. Enjoy the rest of your life.” The dealer smirked, leaving the alleyway as another ten thugs entered the alleyway, surrounding Guang Hwa with a bored expression. </p><p>“All right, say your last words and make your peace.” The leader of the hired thugs yawned, the job being just another one in his books. </p><p>Guang Hwa was clearly panicking, his eyes darting all over the roofs. “Come on, boss! Whatever the fuck you’re planning, do it now!” he screamed in fear.</p><p>“Huh?” The leader was confused, hearing the sound of something hurtling toward him from above. His instincts kicked in, causing him to jump out of the way and assume a fighting stance. </p><p>“Get all of our men in here NOW!” He did not underestimate the enemy, immediately recognizing that it was a trap by the Seven Snakes. </p><p>Out of the dust cloud caused by the crash came Kyle, cracking and stretching his limbs, as if to warm his body up. “Been a while. Damian, Niko, Adrian. Do you have eyes on the dealer?”</p><p>[Intercepting now.]</p><p>“Good. Let’s have some fun.” </p><p>Chapter 56: Sabotage</p><p>Kyle deftly sidestepped the incoming punch and ducked as a sword swung horizontally over his head. With a quick counterswing of his hammer, he fractured the ribs of the first thug before swiveling around him and kicking him in the back. The thug crashed into one of his allies.</p><p>Three swings and an arrow came in straight at him, forcing Kyle to hop backward, his speed faster than that of the average fighter, thanks to his increased Dexterity. The leader did not look surprised, simply ordering the thugs to corner Kyle even tighter. “Killing the Seven Snakes leader would be the biggest haul of our lives!”</p><p><em>Penchant for Violence!</em></p><p>A familiar surge of power rushed through Kyle’s body, strengthening his muscles and sharpening his vision. The world around him seemed to slow down even more, with his combat stats all doubled and improved. The stats reported to him via the statistic screen were not linear in effect, but a 100% increase was always welcome. </p><p>The movements of the thugs were in slow motion to him, making it easy for Kyle to parry the incoming strikes. To the cowering Guang Hwa, who was cowering at a safe distance, Kyle looked as though he was moving extremely fast, with ungodly reaction speeds. The sight burned Kyle’s strength into Guang Hwa’s heart even more. <em>Fuck! I just had to be enslaved by such a monster!</em></p><p>The increase in combat strength and speed caught the leader off-guard. Before he could even reorganize the thugs, half of his dozen-strong squad was already dead, each killed in one hammer blow from Kyle. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Hired Mercenary”</p><p></p><p><em>What? They give 100 EXP? </em>Kyle had expected a low amount of EXP—when he had first killed a Red Lion Thug, he had gotten a mere 10 EXP. </p><p>A sinister grin began to spread on his face as he twirled the hammer by its handle in his right hand, staring right at the leader. “Shit! Hold him off! I’ll finish the job!”</p><p>“Yes, si—” Just as the thugs steeled themselves for their eventual demise, it came faster than expected in the form of Kyle’s lunging strike, dancing through the remaining five thugs and killing all of them in a swift motion even before the leader could move three steps. </p><p>“Damn you!” The leader pulled out a blunderbuss from his back, blasting it right at Kyle. The Projectile Defense Vambrace Kyle had activated was not enough to block the multiple pellets, with half of them making it through to hit Kyle right in the chest. </p><p>“I got you now!” the leader roared, drawing his sword and thrusting it at Kyle. </p><p>However, Kyle was not hurt at all, the breastplate underneath having blocked the rest of the shots as he dodged the stab. After recovering his posture, he delivered a lightning-fast front kick to the leader’s head, knocking the man down onto the ground. </p><p>“Wait, I’m just a hired—” Words no longer came out of the gurgling mouth of the leader; his throat had been snapped in half by a single stomp of Kyle’s foot. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Hired Mercenary Leader”</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Level Up: 15 - 16</strong>: All Stats Increased</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Guang Hwa meekly stepped over the dead bodies of the thugs, afraid to approach Kyle but also equally afraid to try and run away now. Kyle barely gave him a glance as he grabbed his arctech radio while walking to a parked arctech wagon nearby. “Where’s the dealer?”</p><p>Damian’s voice came through the radio. [Sorry, sir. We did not manage to catch him, but Adrian is still on his tail.]</p><p>“No matter. Give me his current location, I’ll handle the rest.”</p><p>In another building in an adjacent district, in a room filled with a cluster of radios and old newspapers, as well as multiple copies of the map of Raktor and its surrounding areas. Two clerks scrambled around as they listened in to all the public radio stations and checked up on the latest news. Each of the maps was marked with a note denoting recent happenings.</p><p>The door was suddenly flung wide open, with a flustered dealer storming through the room. </p><p>“Sir, I have news that the military is increasing their purchase of arcite ore and recalling their reservists. I believe—” the clerk said urgently before the dealer cut him off, waving his hands frantically. </p><p>“NOW IS NOT THE FUCKING TIME!” The dealer grabbed the clerk by the collar and roared, “There are enemies coming for us!”</p><p>“Wh-What? Why?”</p><p>“The fucking Seven Snakes! You two go and defend with the rest of the guards! What are you giving me that blank look for? I OWN YOU! Now go!” </p><p>The clerks scrambled out of the office, each grabbing a repeater handgun. The handgun was not of the same design as Kyle’s, but a far worse and less efficient design—a result of reverse-engineering. With all the original copies of Kyle’s handgun destroyed, the reverse-engineering was an attempt at duplicating the concept rather than the actual mechanism. </p><p>The dealer panicked as he scrambled around the room, grabbing a sack and stuffing everything valuable he had hidden around the safehouse. Just as he was about to finish up, the sounds of screaming and fighting were already echoing through the building that he was in, causing him to tense up even more. </p><p><em>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</em> The dealer cursed inwardly, quickly lifting the sack over his shoulder and heading toward the exit. <em>It’s fine; my thirty guards can stall him long enough for me to make my escape. I just have to make it to—</em></p><p>The dealer opened the door only to see a smiling Kyle, barely panting as countless guards lay scattered along the ornate hallway behind him, rolling on the ground incapacitated. “Wha—”</p><p>Kyle grabbed him by the mouth, causing him to drop the sack with countless precious jewels and ornamental figures. “I’ve heard that you’ve been stealing certain secrets from me.”</p><p>“I only purchase what is put in front of me. It is your own men who betrayed you.”</p><p>“I have already dealt with him. It doesn’t change the fact that you are in possession of the goods.”</p><p>The dealer noticed Kyle was up to something. If the gang leader had been truly angry, he would have already been dead. The dealer knew as much. “How much do you want?”</p><p>“Ah, signs of intelligence. You sold the construction blueprints to the Ardent Cretins for a nice five million rakels, did you not?”</p><p><em>So the first deal was a trap too!</em> The dealer was astonished that Kyle was using his own blueprints as a money-making scheme. He already knew what Kyle was going to ask for next. “So you want me to hand over the blueprints, the goods, AND pay you back five million rakels?”</p><p>“Oh, I think you are misunderstanding something. I want ninety million rakels now. You can keep the blueprints.”</p><p>“What?!” The dealer was completely confused now. Ninety million rakels was more than his entire fortune three times over, but the dealer took a second glance at the whimpering guards outside; burly men turned into crying babies. “How the fuck am I supposed to give you that amount of money?”</p><p>“You’re an information dealer, are you not? Do what you do best.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>Two weeks later…</em></p><p>The shopping arcade built by the Ardent Cretins was having its grand opening day, with a much larger turnout and fanfare thanks to the immense marketing budget the union and Sebastian had thrown in. The shopping arcade was significantly larger, spanning an entire urban block, unlike the single-building size of the Seven Snakes’, adding even more to the grandeur and the “wow” factor.</p><p>Hundreds of businessmen, wealthy middle-class and lesser nobles turned up, with the shopping arcade this time dedicated to only the upper class. The Ardent Cretins actively blocked the slum dwellers and poorer folks from approaching the area, making it a limited area. </p><p><em>This is the way to make a shopping arcade profitable—why pander to those with no money?</em> Sebastian smirked to himself as he stood by the side, watching the chairman take the stand with an opening speech. </p><p>“This may not be the first shopping arcade established in Raktor, but it is most certainly the biggest. We promise the best in entertainment and satisfaction to all our patrons here—a dedicated zone!”</p><p>The crowd nodded in agreement; many of the attendees had previously shunned the Seven Snakes shopping arcade due to the influx of lowborn workers and poor individuals. Many of them detested the idea of giving out free amenities to the public, though they internally admitted that it had a dramatic increase in footfall. </p><p>As such, upper society was split on which model to follow. With Sebastian’s new shopping arcade, the ardent supporters of the class hierarchy finally had something to back. Sebastian had no shortage of investors who wanted to establish a limited shopping arcade tailored to the wealthy. The notion was not unique at all. </p><p>“And without further ado, we shall now open the new shopping arcade! Enjoy the luxuries we have to your heart’s content!”</p><p>Unlike the surging crowd that tried to force their way in during the Seven Snakes’ shopping arcade’s opening day, the crowd here was a lot more mannered, entering in an orderly fashion. Sebastian spotted a familiar face in the throng of people, causing him to smile as he made his way over.</p><p>“I did not expect you to actually accept the invitation.”</p><p>“A senior must always support his junior. Is that not the case?”</p><p>“You don’t seem particularly surprised at the construction of this shopping arcade.”</p><p>“Of course, the innovations I have implemented are hardly cutting-edge. Even a layman could make his own, given the right understanding. It was only a matter of time.”</p><p>“Well then, as thanks for your warning, I would like to inform you that your innovations are out on the black market for everyone to see. I could give you the name of the dealer who has been leaking them,” Sebastian said with a tinge of glee in his voice as he watched Kyle’s face twist in anger. “Perhaps even now, other businesses in other sectors are buying the information right now.”</p><p>Kyle looked furious. “Thank you for the tip. I wish you only the best for the rest of your opening day.” He stormed off, not bothering to enter the shopping arcade. </p><p><em>Most likely, he is going to perform a purge of the Seven Snakes.</em> Sebastian himself did not know who had been the one who leaked the information, only that he had bought it from the dealer as the middleman. He gloated to himself, walking into the shopping arcade guarded by two Ardent Cretin bodyguards, watching the attendees visit the countless shops. </p><p>The first hour was truly a success, with the temperature control engravings cooling the air within the corridors and shops while extravagant lighting awed the customers. Sebastian had only invited the very best that the South Sector had to offer—beauty products, fashion, and jewelry were all on display here. </p><p>“Sir? Sir… You are needed at the main control office,” an Ardent Cretins thug whispered to Sebastian. The man promptly followed the man, entering an office on the top floor with a dozen engineers all arguing with each other. </p><p>“What’s the matter? What’s going on?”</p><p>“Sir, it’s hard to explain, but our estimates of the arcite fuel consumption are off by a slight margin.”</p><p>Sebastian narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“The temperature control engravings—the efficiency is much lower than expected.”</p><p>“How much are we talking about?”</p><p>“It’s not much, but…”</p><p>“Tell me the numbers.”</p><p>“The efficiency is only about seventy percent at best.”</p><p>“Did we not estimate at least eighty percent efficiency?”</p><p>“Yes, but…” </p><p>At that moment, another engineer burst in through the office door. “Sebastian, sir! The lights are flickering! I think the lighting engravings are overheating!”</p><p>“Turn off a few of them to alleviate the strain. All of you, keep working on improving the design. Surely the twelve of you can beat an old university professor from a small gang, can’t you?”</p><p>“Uh… yes, sir.”</p><p>Sebastian wasted no time, heading up to the duplicated light-thrower theater’s projector room, which had more than five employees scrambling inside preparing for the debut show. “Are you sure you’ve tested the light-thrower?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, we did a test run yesterday with a sample movie. It ran smoothly for a good fifteen minutes.”</p><p>“Try it now.”</p><p>“Sir?” </p><p>“Try it now!”</p><p>The employee hastily activated the light-thrower, projecting the sample movie on the theater screen. Not even after a minute had gone by, the image began to flicker, and sounds of hissing sparks could be heard inside the light-thrower machine. </p><p>Sebastian immediately assumed it was a failsafe implemented by Silver Snakes Productions, quickly opening up a side panel of the light thrower and inspecting it. Already he could see the traces on the engraving slightly warping as it fizzled out, resulting in the weird behavior. </p><p>“Cancel the light-thrower show.”</p><p>“But sir, that’s the main attraction of the—”</p><p>“CANCEL IT NOW!” Sebastian roared, prompting the employees to quickly scamper out of the room, relaying the order to the others. <em>That fucking slimy dealer—charging me for more than twenty million rakels for this sham?! I will find him and kill him!</em></p><p>Chapter 57: Arms Industry</p><p>Despite the sanctions against the Seven Snakes’ shopping arcade, it had been holding up well for more than a month since its inception. Already, it had become a mainstay for local residents, both from within the district and beyond, to visit. </p><p>The light-thrower shows brought countless visitors from other sectors to watch the movies, while the free bathhouse accommodated the poorer people, improving their livelihood. </p><p>With the growing business of the shopping arcade, more and more employment opportunities began to open up as businesses and shop owners began to snap up the neighboring units, trying to entice customers who flocked to the shopping arcade. </p><p>Squatters even began to shift residences nearby, with Golden Snake Construction beginning to renovate nearby buildings into mass accommodations. While the facilities were slightly lacking in that there were only mass toilets and a barebones room, it was more than enough for the perennially homeless people. </p><p>Of course, the catch was that the squatters had to be employed in a Seven Snakes–related business, legal or not. Wages were still paid via the construction company, but in reality, it was a no-show job, where the squatters would then work in pubs, casinos, or brothels. </p><p>The stronger ones were whisked away secretly to the Culdao Peaks goblin dens, assisting in the modernization of the caves into a burgeoning industrialized society. Kyle had never been the one to place all his eggs in one basket—there was always the off chance that Raktor might suffer in the future. It was always good to have a backup plan. </p><p>As the bathhouse and shopping arcade became a hotspot for gatherings, it was easier to influence the local population into believing that the gang was a force for good. Many began to idolize the gang lifestyle, once again increasing the number of associates to nearly double what they had before. Now, the number of members neared two hundred of them, with expectations that it could swell to five hundred in another few months. </p><p>Kyle smiled to himself as he read a few newspapers reporting on the recent string of events that led to the Ardent Cretins canceling their light-thrower debut show. Many other impatient companies who had bought from the black market information dealer without checking also suffered heavily, having to scale back their expansion plans. </p><p>These reported events led to an increase in the reputation of the light-thrower theater in the Seven Snakes’ shopping arcade, making it the go-to destination for high-quality movies. More importantly, the movies being shown were much better than the amateur movies that other sectors were showing. </p><p>Short story arcs lifted right from the Galactic Era were modified for the local audience, such as the blockbuster hit <em>The Ring of the Lords</em>. However, Kyle had to heavily modify the story in the event that another person with knowledge of the franchise would pick up on it. He garbled the storyline, but the audience still lapped it up, with already a few well-known citizens being avid theater-goers. </p><p>Also, the companies that tried to barge in on the rental market for light-throwers and light-capturers were stunted by the “bad” engravings Kyle had designed and leaked on purpose, further boosting the brand name of the Silver Snakes as one of quality and assurance.</p><p>“Everyone, I am proud to announce that, as of today, we have finally turned a profit on the shopping arcade!” Keith announced to the office filled with administrative clerks, who all cheered. </p><p>“So when are we getting our bonuses?” A clerk raised his hands. </p><p>“Nice try. If we can keep this up for a month, I’ll think about it.” Keith chuckled before walking up to Kyle’s desk, who seized him up. </p><p>“Keith, status report on all companies and businesses. Keep it brief.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Our pubs and brothels have increased footfall thanks to our truce with the enforcers. Everyone knows the Seven Snakes districts are well-protected, so the mental barrier that most people had is starting to crumble.”</p><p>“Moving on. The Silver Snakes Productions have reported a monthly profit, mainly due to the rental equipment. As of now, we have been making a loss on the theater tickets.”</p><p>Kyle sighed, rubbing his forehead. “We don’t have much choice here. If we priced it appropriately, only the middle and upper classes would be able to attend. Continue.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Golden Snake completed the construction of the mass apartments and dormitories a week ago. No faults or issues have been reported as of now. The cost of utilities such as arcia power lines to each room is still being calculated.”</p><p>“That’s fine; we don’t have enough arcite ore to power it… yet.”</p><p>“We had three prospective clients, one of which is Baron Cain.”</p><p>“Baron Cain?” Kyle was astonished to hear that the noble in charge of the South Sector was directly requesting the construction company’s services. “What’s the contract for?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, quoting directly from the letter sent: ‘A request for a quote regarding the construction of a metallurgy factory in Raktor that will mainly produce processed metal ingots. Specifically, high-grade steel ingots.’ It also stressed that the factory be completed swiftly, should the contract be accepted.”</p><p>Kyle raised his eyebrows even higher, surprised. “Give the letter to me. I’ll handle it.” <em>Something isn’t right. Why would that greedy baron want a metallurgy factory when most current construction projects do not rely on it? Unless…</em></p><p>Damian entered the office, walking right up to Kyle’s desk and saluting. “Sir, the black market dealer has skipped out of town. The safehouses seemed to have been burned down. I’ve heard rumors of multiple gangs and thugs after his life.”</p><p>“Of course; he sold the degraded engravings that break apart after a certain period of time. I’m sure they will find the right people to fix it, but it is still going to take time and effort.” Kyle nodded. “Did you find anything else?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. I found scribblings on an undamaged desk. It seems to be the notes of a clerk working right under the information dealer.” Damian handed over a leatherbound notebook filled with scribbles that were barely legible. </p><p>Kyle quickly read the contents. <em>Hmm, seems like he was keeping track of all the information so he could make it out on his own when he wanted to. Commendable.</em> The journal was surprisingly detailed and clear in terms of the date and timing of occurrences, stringing a pattern together. </p><p>Kyle flipped to the pages that covered the last two weeks, immediately noticing what the pattern was leading to. “Keith, what has the military been doing?”</p><p>“Hmm? I recently heard they increased their bulk orders of arcite ore. Apart from that, I don’t know. Oh! There are military exercises that are going to be held nearby, but it’s an annual event, so it’s not too surprising.”</p><p>“When is that?”</p><p>“Hmm, its planned to be half a year from now. Why? What did you find in the journal?”</p><p>Kyle didn’t reply, instead asking Keith and Damian to bring all the old newspapers collected over the past two weeks, corroborating the journal with the events reported in the newspaper. <em>Stockpiling of energy sources, the concentration of military personnel, activation of reservist forces… and now the baron wants to build a factory?</em> “Did the baron state when he wanted it done?”</p><p>“No, but he did say he needed it swiftly…”</p><p>Kyle now knew exactly what was happening. How could a crime lord of the Melsura Star Sector not infer from the events right in front of his eyes?</p><p>“Keith, gather everyone of importance here. Our previous plan of expansion has to be changed dramatically.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Baron Cain stepped out of his wagon, escorted by five bodyguards, as he marveled at the shopping arcade. He had not attended the opening day itself and was seeing it for the first time. <em>Impressive.</em> He could now see why all the lesser nobles and landowners were so riled up by this new trend. </p><p>“Ah, Baron Cain. Pleased to be of service! I am Guang Hwa, President of the Golden Snake Constru—”</p><p>“Shut up and bring me to someone who actually matters.”</p><p>Guang Hwa was noticeably irritated by the condescending look, but he still put on a fake smile and led the baron to a specialized, well-decorated VIP room for meetings, with enough posh and luxury to make the baron feel as though he were in another noble’s dwelling. </p><p>Kyle was already waiting for him, getting up from his velvet chair and bowing. “Thank you for coming, Baron Cain. The Golden Snake Construction company is honored to have you as a potential customer.”</p><p>“Hmph. As you should.” Cain sat down opposite him in a regal chair. “Let’s get to the point. I want a quote on how much the steel factory would cost.”</p><p>“Of course. I can easily provide the numbers, but I believe we can offer something of additional benefit that may interest you.”</p><p>“What benefits can you give? A steel factory is a steel factory.”</p><p>“I am referring to other events that should not fall on certain prying ears. Rumors of war.” Kyle glanced at the five bodyguards surrounding them and Guang Hwa. </p><p>“Leave us.” Baron Cain motioned to his bodyguards, with the five and Guang Hwa complying. As soon as they left the room, Cain’s face turned extremely sour. “How the hell do you know? Espionage against nobility can be considered a crime.”</p><p>Kyle whipped out the journal he had. “Taken from a black market dealer’s clerk. Make of that what you will. I only inferred the gist of things; I am not clear on the details.”</p><p>“So what? You’re just a gang—I doubt you have anyt—” Baron Cain caught himself before continuing, his eyes narrowing as he realized what Kyle was hinting at. “You’re insane.”</p><p>Kyle smiled. “How about you hear me out before you dismiss it? If you have heard everything I had to say and still want the base quote, I won’t press the matter.”</p><p>Baron Cain hesitated for a moment but ultimately nodded, prompting Kyle to continue. </p><p>“I can roughly gather from your countenance that your attempt to sell a new technology regarding firearms to the military has failed spectacularly.” Kyle stood up and began to slowly pace the room. </p><p><em>Only because you placed your failsafe inside.</em> “That’s a groundless assertion—you don’t know if I tried.”</p><p>“That’s true, but I also understand that the nobility has a large burden when attempting any military maneuvers. Your contribution to the military is directly tied to prestige. Anyone who shirks this obligation may and has been stripped of their titles, if any. But if your contribution remains among the top, the emperor will recognize you and award you a higher title or more concessions. That was how Count Leon made his initial rise fifteen years ago.”</p><p>“For an amnesiac, you seem to know history too well.”</p><p>“Will having a simple steel factory be enough? I’m sure other nobles out there have much better resources and opportunities to contribute. Are you satisfied with your current standing?”</p><p>“Speak directly and stop beating around the bush! What exactly are you proposing?”</p><p>“You already know what I am proposing. Give me half of the funds and the license to expand the steel factory into a weapons factory as well. I’ll cover the rest. But I must retain overall control of the factory.”</p><p>Baron Cain had already expected this. “You are asking me to certify a criminal organization to have the legal license to produce guns? After all you’ve done? Are you mad?”</p><p>“Why not? Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Also, the company created to run it will be clean. At least to the outside world. As long as you just give your word, you will shoot through the ranks, not even needing to lift a single finger.”</p><p>Cain was a greedy person, so Kyle’s speech already appealed to him directly. He could already envision the countless heaps of merits and concessions he would receive once the war was won. He was also confident that Kyle had the technology and methods to elevate his contributions. After all, the war with the Ilysian Punks had clearly shown Kyle’s capabilities. </p><p>“What’s in it for you? You won’t receive any awards or prestige from doing this.” </p><p>“Baron Cain, I’ve said this before. I am a businessman, first and foremost, who had the unfortunate luck of dealing in certain ventures of high profit. Of course, I will do everything I can to come out swinging at such an exciting time, will I not? I simply want to improve my position in society, as you do. Shall we work together?”</p><p>Baron Cain was irked by the comparison, but he internally agreed with Kyle. Both of them sought to climb the social ladder—everyone wanted to move to the next rung. Even Count Leon was no different. After all, was that not why the war was about to be started?</p><p>Originally, the baron felt that the war would be a burden on him. However, with the possibility of a new venture with Kyle, he was starting to see the war as a boon instead. “Let me consider it and get back to you.”</p><p>“I understand. However, please understand we may not be able to meet the deadline the longer it is delayed. Our entire construction company will work on it.” Kyle bowed as Baron Cain stood up.</p><p>“Not a word of this is to spread to anyone else. Do you understand? Especially of the war.”</p><p>“Yes, Baron Cain.” </p><p>As Cain left the premises with his five bodyguards, Kyle could not help smiling to himself back in his office. “Keith, did you find any more information on when the diplomatic mission from Versia is coming in?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, but only fragments. They are arriving in Raktor to negotiate compensation with Count Leon in approximately a week or so. The exact day of arrival is hard to pinpoint.”</p><p>“Does not matter. Keep an eye out for their arrival.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, but why are you looking for the Versia diplomats? Are you afraid that they might take revenge for what we did to the Ilysian Punks?”</p><p>“No, Keith. I have a business proposal for them. One that will definitely pique their interest.”</p><p>Chapter 58: Double Agent</p><p>The procession was public, as the Versia diplomatic team arrived via a wagon convoy protected by more than three dozen guards. The diplomats stared in curiosity as a dozen light-capturers had their beady black lenses aimed at them. </p><p>The news of the light-capturer invention was not particularly new in Versia, where a few entrepreneurial companies had already tried to create their own knockoffs. However, it was still a sight to see it spread through society so quickly. News companies were capitalizing on the new medium of information rapidly, its changes echoing through the city of Raktor.</p><p>“Ah, Minister Dekar. It is good to finally meet you in person.” Count Leon was already in position, ready to receive them at the grand steps to the central office that handled all affairs in the county. He bowed to a man wearing a sharp, tight uniform adorned with tens of medals, signifying his rank and position in the government of Versia.</p><p>“It is good to see you as well, Count Leon.” Minister Dekar smiled as he stretched out his hand, shaking Count Leon’s hand in a sign of goodwill. Both of them had wide smiles on their faces, as did the rest of the accompanying diplomatic group and the four barons who stood behind Count Leon. </p><p>The reporters quickly recorded the entire event, speaking rapidly into their arctech recording devices, their voices to be released alongside the recorded light-capturer movies. </p><p>The dignitaries wasted no time, immediately following Count Leon into the meeting room, where two long tables were laid out facing each other, with chairs already pre-designated for each member of the diplomatic team. </p><p>The opposing parties chatted a bit with each other, exchanging small talk as they waited for the meeting to begin. Many of them knew each other from both sides, having met before in their former jobs or through diplomatic missions both before and after the previous war. </p><p>“Everyone, we shall begin.” Count Leon announced, taking his seat right in the center of the Yual Dominion’s table. </p><p>As soon as the meeting began proper, however, the air immediately became tense, with the two teams clearly knowing what this was all about. </p><p>“So, to clarify the purpose of this meeting: your citizens have been caught red-handed smuggling weapons into Versia from Raktor, and—”</p><p>“Ex-citizens, need I remind you,” Minister Dekar interrupted. “General Javel had been previously stripped of his citizenship. And so have all of the… Ilysian Punks’ members.”</p><p>“—and the Versia military has been directly complicit in this entire affair.”</p><p>“How strange. This sounds like a simple case: Your nation can’t keep its criminal organizations under control. I would also like to officially state that the Versia military has not received any of these aforementioned weapons, none whatsoever.”</p><p>“Criminals that stem from your nation are directly sabotaging Raktor to empower Versia. I have direct evidence that your military personnel, former or not, are actively assisting in the transfer of these smuggled goods.” Count Leon motioned with his hand, prompting a servant to bring forward a stack of papers, placing them in front of the diplomatic delegation. </p><p>“Each of these papers represents a formal license to transport weapons around the country of Versia, signed off directly by an official of the government.”</p><p>“We have already dealt with the corrupted official, but the fact remains that the guns have never made their way into the formal military. It is purely a criminal transaction, from one black market to another. We did not actively plan for nor support such activities—our own Versian enforcers are performing an investigation right no—”</p><p>“I don’t care about what your enforcers are doing!” Count Leon snarled, raising the tension even higher. “The simple fact as I see it is this: It is Versians who have been smuggling guns out of our military facilities INTO your country, and you must pay!”</p><p>“I find that accusation ungrounded and misleading—the government of Versia does not claim to have jurisdiction or control over every single citizen that has been excommunicated and stripped of citizenship! Such a statement would lead me to also accuse your ex-countrymen of establishing human trafficking rings in my own country as well!” Minister Dekar shot back. “On top of that, your military shows clear signs of mobilization, something that is clearly aimed at Versia!”</p><p>“Is my military not allowed to perform military exercises within our sovereign territory? We have been performing the same exercise every two years.”</p><p>The barons and the Versian delegation remained silent as the argument was solely waged between the minister and the count. Both sides were unwilling to back down, but the minister knew that he had already lost the moral ground. It was an undeniable fact that the guns had indeed been smuggled into Versia. He tried his hardest to deflect or counter with other examples, but Count Leon stayed on task. </p><p>“Here is my ultimatum: Your country will catch all criminals involved in the smuggling and distribution of Yual Dominion’s technology, as well as pay back reparations of an equivalent sum. The hijacking of our military facilities has negatively impacted our economy, resulting in losses of nearly 500 million rakels in total.”</p><p>“Ridiculous! You want us to be your hunting dogs and compensate you as well?! I would like to remind you that the original reason for the smuggling to occur was because you, too, have potential corruption brewing in your own military. How is it possible for a small gang to smuggle that many guns? Surely not without inside information?”</p><p>The negotiations went back and forth before the meeting concluded indecisively, adjourning for a lunch break. Count Leon signaled toward Minister Dekar, prompting the man to follow him into a side room, which was a simple resting area with amenities. </p><p>Closing the door behind him, Count Leon gave a smile, his countenance far different from the aggressive mannerism he portrayed in the meeting. He shook hands with Dekar again, slightly confusing the minister. </p><p>“Ah, I guess your predecessor did not inform you of what is going to happen.” Count Leon smirked as he poured himself a glass of wine, sipping on it carefully. “Did you ever wonder how your predecessor was able to buy such a grand mansion despite the paltry government salary your ‘democratic’ system pays you?”</p><p>Dekar squinted his eyes in comprehension. “You’re saying he accepted bribes. From you.”</p><p>“Minister Dekar, I’m sure you are a proud citizen of Versia who believes in the democratic system, but be honest with yourself. How hard have you been working to support the people of Versia, with nothing but a pittance of a salary to show for it? Despite being a representative of an entire nation! The business owners are all earning far more than you! I hear Harrison is making more than ever. Do you not think it is unfair?”</p><p>“I will not be so easily swaye—”</p><p>“Ah, listen to my offer first. I will give you fifty million rakels as well as show clear signs of demobilization across the country. The military exercise will be postponed as per usual. You get to go back home and claim that you are a herald of peace, solving the crisis. I will also give you custody of General Javel and every other Ilysian Punks member that is rotting in jail in due time, letting you show off to the people that you have worked hard to ensure that your people remain free. What a good story, is it not? Your political career will be legendary! Or perhaps you would prefer the alternative of war?”</p><p>The meeting soon resumed after the lunch break, with the diplomatic delegation taking their seats once again. Many of them expected the same argument to be continued between Count Leon and Minister Dekar, but surprisingly, there was little opposition raised by the minister anymore. </p><p>“Fine, we shall pay the compensation of 500 million rakels. But in return, you must cease the mobilization of Yual Dominion forces at our border! Also, you must release all Versian citizens currently in custody back to us.” Minister Dekar put on a strong façade. </p><p>“A fine compromise. Under the authority bestowed upon me by the emperor, I accept the deal on behalf of the Yual Dominion. Let us hash out the finer details of transfers now.”</p><p>The meeting took another three days as the members of the diplomatic team scrambled to hash out the clauses in the deal, covering every possible legal loophole in the agreement. The Yual Dominion tried to sneak a few terms into the agreement, which were immediately caught by the delegation, prompting a few arguments and accusations of unfair treatment.</p><p>As the procedure was going on, Minister Dekar was resting in his room when a diplomat knocked on his door. “Come in.”</p><p>“Sir, apologies for disturbing you.”</p><p>“It is of no matter. What is it? Has the count tried to sneak in a separate clause yet again?”</p><p>“No, sir, the Yual Dominion has stopped trying to do so for now. I received word that a certain individual would like to meet you, though he is only willing to meet you outside Raktor.”</p><p>“Outside Raktor? Preposterous! Sounds like a trap to simply assassinate me!”</p><p>“He says we can bring as many people as we want. Also, he sent us this. We have checked it to ensure it’s neither a bomb nor an assassination device.” The diplomat handed over a metallic case embellished with an ornamental design that seemed oriental. </p><p><em>This… This is!</em> Minister Dekar’s eyes widened in shock. Everyone had heard about the first civilian repeater handgun sold in an auction at the Central Sector of Raktor. Even his agents had reported on the design of the handgun, touted as being better than most current military guns.</p><p>Dekar opened the case to reveal a replica of the Oriental Bloom that Baron Cain owned himself, though it was not exactly the same. “He’s the creator?!”</p><p>“In the note provided with this case, he claims he is not the creator but someone who has managed to decipher the inner workings behind the handguns. He wants to discuss a potential agreement for Versia.”</p><p>Minister Dekar was more than happy to hear this. The reason why Versia was always on the back foot was due to its perceived weaker military strength and a smaller economy. After all, their gross product did not even match a third of Raktor’s economic output. He would never admit it publicly, but the government was definitely complicit in the smuggling of guns from Raktor in order to alleviate the imbalance in military strength. </p><p>Now that he had a chance to meet with an arctech designer able to level the playing field, he was not going to let up that easily. </p><p>“Where is the meeting point?”</p><p>“Around the Culdao Peaks area. I suggest we use a body double to make the Yual Dominion believe that we are returning to Versia while another wagon takes you to the secret meeting point.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The plan was put into place immediately, with Minister Dekar and a team of a dozen Versian guards disguised as a merchant escort moving out from Raktor toward the Culdao Peaks. </p><p>They blended in easily into the hordes of merchants in the now-expanded Culdao Peaks Town, with the marketplace increasing in size and the wealth of the town increasing. More and more people were migrating into the town in search of fame and fortune, while other merchants began to invest in supporting industries to facilitate the travelers and other traders who bought and sold the Euria Seeds. </p><p>A lone hooded man was waiting for them in an alleyway, immediately turning and walking into the forest while Dekar and the guards followed. <em>Where is he taking us? I’ve heard rumors of domesticated goblins, but surely he does not intend to use the hostility of the goblins against us?</em></p><p>The Versian guards were all well armored under their normal clothes, complete with an armor set as well as an arctech pistol. Dekar gingerly stepped through the dense foliage, though there was a clear, rough path created by the continuous movement of workers carrying Euria Seeds. </p><p>Suddenly, five goblins appeared on the treeline, leaping past the guards overhead, who all reacted instantly and held their pistols at the ready. </p><p>“Hold your fire—they’re making sure you weren’t followed.” The lone hooded man turned around, with fifteen goblins lining up behind him. </p><p>“Wha— How did you domesticate the goblins?” Dekar couldn’t help asking. Even in his homeland, there were many failed attempts at restraining the goblins, causing losses and continuous rebellions. </p><p>One of the goblins clearly took offense at the insult at being treated like cattle and was about to retort when the hooded man raised his hand. “You do not need to know how I did it, only if I can deliver. The playing field between both militaries is hilariously skewed, and both you and I know Versia needs a helping hand.”</p><p>“So you want us to buy weapons from your operation here in the Culdao Peaks…?”</p><p>“Of course. I would like to aid in the upgrading of the Versian military to counter Raktor aggression.”</p><p>Dekar grew slightly wary. <em>He must have an ulterior motive. </em>“Why have you not done this for the Yual Dominion? Surely they would pay you a higher price.”</p><p>“Their motivations are not aligned with mine. I am a firm believer in Versia sovereignty. The governing principles of the Yual Dominion are far too backward for my liking. Although, I am open to have a further meeting when you are ready to negotiate further.”</p><p><em>What rubbish. He is obviously in it for the money, but he is right. This is something the Versian military needs dearly.  </em>Instead of revealing his cynicism, Dekar had a wide grin on his face. </p><p>“Ahah, a fellow supporter of democracy! Of course, we welcome your help! However, this… negotiations must be held in Versia, though I would prefer that these goblins do not follow you.” </p><p>Dekar glanced again at the fifteen goblins, many of whom snarled back at him. <em>If he comes and stay in Versia, I will be able to deploy better spies than the ones we have in Raktor to steal the design. It seems that these goblins are not easy to bribe. Maybe that’s even better—I can capture him myself. I have to hook him in first.</em></p><p>“That is only possible if your government gives me the assurance that I will not be attacked or enslaved within Versia itself.” The hooded man countered. “My technology and learnings are a prize in itself - any attempts to steal them will be met with… unnecessary complications for you and your men trailing you.” </p><p>“Of course, of course, we would never hurt you” Dekar grinned widely, hiding his shock at the hooded man’s awareness of his hidden bodyguards scattered around the forest in case a fight broke out. “In fact, as a representative of the state, I myself will issue you a letter of approval for your direct entry into Versia.!”</p><p>“Then I look forward to future negotiations. Send me a messenger when you are ready.” </p><p>“Indeed. I look forward to a fruitful relationship, Mister…?”</p><p>“Greyborn. Kris Greyborn.”</p><p>Chapter 59: Refocus</p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>The Seven Snakes were in a complete frenzy as Kyle began to ramp up the production.</p><p>Keith was over the moon with the baron’s acceptance of the steel and weapons factory, but was slightly confused by his leader’s next request.</p><p>“Wait, you want me to find people who look exactly like you?”</p><p>“It is normal for every person to have a doppelganger somewhere in the world. As long as they look about sixty to seventy percent alike, we can make up for the rest using makeup and disguises.”</p><p>“What are you planning this time?”</p><p>“There is a chance that I will go to Versia after a few months; once this factory project is completed and our control of the districts have stabilized.”</p><p>“What?!” Keith exclaimed.</p><p>Kyle had already made up his mind the moment he met Minister Dekar. Hedging his bets on his new venture was far safer than relying entirely on the purchase of his weapons by Count Leon’s military. There would be a clear cartel and barrier to entry. </p><p><em>Always have an escape route planned.</em> Versia was that escape route if it really came down to the wire. He had no clear loyalty to Raktor nor Versia, only the place that would give him the most profit. If Raktor did not provide that, then Versia would have to do. </p><p>To reduce suspicion from the local nobility and other gangs about his potential months-long disappearance in the future, he needed to find a doppelganger that could potentially act as him and throw off any potential observers watching him. He had already risked a lot heading over to the Culdao Peaks to negotiate with the minister.</p><p>“So you just want me to go to the streets and grab those who look the most similar?”</p><p>“Yes, try to find six if possible.” Kyle nodded his head, causing Keith to sigh and shake his head, wondering what Kyle was up to now.</p><p>“There’s no reason to go to Versia—we have no connections there and almost no stake. You’ll be pretty much going in blind,” Keith pointed out, trying to dissuade Kyle. “Versia is also too far away from us, so you won’t be able to access our current assets as well!”</p><p>“I will prepare well in advance, do not worry. We have half a year ahead of us.” Kyle waved his hand dismissively. “Look at what I started with in the Seven Snakes as well, and look where we are now.”</p><p>Keith was about to retort but held his tongue. He wanted to argue that Kyle did have certain connections, but he realized that he was thinking about “Alvin.” With Kyle’s prowess, he would succeed nearly everywhere—why would Versia be any different?</p><p>“The Seven Snakes would have to expand eventually. Moving to another city or country is always a given with time.  We as a whole have to think further, especially once we have secured our position here. I know you feel that, as we are right now, our progress will always be hampered by the Ardent Cretins incessantly. They are still restricting us economically. The way we overcame the original debt to the Crimson Swords was by expanding to the Culdao Peaks. Versia will be no different. ”</p><p>“You won’t be going alone, right? If you die in Versia…” Keith couldn’t bear to think of what would happen if Kyle died. He recalled how, just a few months ago, they had been a small gang of twenty to thirty members. Today, they numbered close to three hundred, thanks to the recruiting efforts of the free soup kitchen, public cleanup events, and bathhouse.</p><p>Keith would not dare to claim that the Seven Snakes were completely united as a capable force, but it was a far cry from the paltry command of Ulon. If Kyle were to die, this entire pyramid would most likely fall apart. Keith wasn’t as strong as Kyle to be able to hold the entire gang through charisma and strength. No one else in the Seven Snakes was, all putting their respect on Kyle rather than each other.</p><p>“Of course not. We will see over the course of our preparation. But I do have a few guides in mind.” Nearly all of his underlings were critical, and those that were not were ill-suited to serve as Versia guides or even bodyguards. </p><p>“Okay, I will immediately try to find the body doubles as soon as possible.” Keith saluted. Just as he was about to leave Kyle’s office, Niko barged in, panting wildly as he held a folder of documents in his right arm. </p><p>“Sir…” Niko panted, an exhausted grin on his face. “We got it! We got the license for the weapons factory!”</p><p>Kyle, too, had a wide smile on his face, immediately standing up and grabbing the licenses from Niko’s hand, checking them. “Call everyone into the office for a celebration. Now,” Kyle ordered Keith, who nodded immediately.</p><p>It took half an hour for all the vipers, the company heads, Gordon, Eric, and Damian to pause their current tasks and return, wondering what was so urgent for Kyle to call all of them back in. Only Keith and Niko had excited expressions on their faces, while the rest were utterly confused. </p><p>“You all have followed me for months, and some have followed me for nearly half a year now.” Kyle began his speech. “Since I took leadership in the Seven Snakes, we have grown exponentially, with our reputation and name soaring and reverberating throughout the South Sector. Even the gangs in the other sectors talk about us and our exploits on a regular basis with wonder and amazement in their tones.”</p><p>“Today, I would like to announce that as of this day, for the first time in Seven Snakes’ history, we have an official license to manufacture weapons for the military, just like every other major gang!” Kyle proudly showed off the license to them, causing Damian to nearly exclaim in shock.</p><p>Such a license represented one of the top positions in society—not any ragtag group could obtain it unless they had a master’s approval from the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths. Even for the bigger players, it was a feat unachievable just by asking. Every holder of the license had to prove their ability to deliver and would make an obscene amount of money from every military contract. Only the Ardent Cretins held a similar license within the South Sector.</p><p>Even Monica, Adrian, and Eric were at a loss for words. Just four months ago, they were simply a ragtag crew smuggling moonshine to businesses that continuously tried to undercut them. In fact, they had been planning to leave the Seven Snakes at the start. Yet now, they stood as one of the top members of the South Sector, respected by everyone. Their aspirations for freedom had already been assuaged by the sheer respect they received.</p><p>Eric nearly shed a tear when he recalled how far he had come. A disgraced university professor affected by the prohibition by the Sanctum of Yual was now a mogul in alcohol distribution and production. His recipes were the backbone of the entire operation, ensuring a consistent stream of dirty money into the Seven Snakes and his own pockets.</p><p>Gordon, too, was grinning to himself as he patted Reese on the back. He had just been a lowly arctech designer with no future—it would have taken him ten years alone even to have a shot at being the factory manager, but he now held authority as well as prestige.</p><p>Sasha was not too concerned with the license, but her own journey under the direct tutelage of Kyle had made her into a force to be reckoned with. No longer was she known as a weak, mute slave that could be easily bullied, even by other slaves. Instead, she reigned at the top next to Kyle, being the second strongest in the Seven Snakes.</p><p>Damian was the most sentimental of them all. He had been there from the very beginning, having seen the second personality of Kyle take over Alvin. Previously, he had an issue with the new personality taking over Alvin’s body, but as he watched the meteoric rise of the Seven Snakes over the months, he was not sure if he even wanted Alvin back at all. Hell, if Alvin’s main personality ever resurfaced, Damian would be the first one to beat it out of him and try to get Kyle back. </p><p><em>Seniors, mentors, First Leader Theorin. The Seven Snakes have returned to their rightful position. </em>Damian sniffled slightly as he rubbed his nose, getting emotional.</p><p>Guang Hwa, on the other hand, was unfazed by all the obvious emotional signs that everyone else was showing. <em>I got fucking enslaved by Kyle. Why would I be happy he’s getting stronger?! Fuck!</em></p><p>“We have suffered setbacks and obstacles, but each day, it is us that have prevailed, that have overcome every enemy that stood in our way. I could not have done it without you, and I truly cherish all of you as partners in this endeavor to rise beyond our station in life.” Kyle’s tone was gentle and tinged with sincerity.</p><p>Suddenly, his face grew grim. “However, what comes next will be the toughest period of our growth. If we make it past the next year, we will be unrivaled in the South Sector for years to come. The information I am about to share with you is of the highest confidentiality—and I trust each and every one of you here.”</p><p>“The war between Versia and Count Leon is inevitable—the resolution signed between the two of them is but a farce. The reasons are unclear to me, but it is a fact that in half a year or more, Count Leon’s military will be assembled for an exercise on the outskirts of Raktor. This could be a potential spark that ignites the conflict, and thus a new phase in the economy of the South Sector. As such, I will ensure that the Seven Snakes gang is in the right position to capitalize on this situation.”</p><p>“This means that there will come a point in time where we must expand to Versia to win on both sides. For now, we will focus on strengthening our position in the South Sector, while I prepare for future plans. There will come a time where I and others will leave the Seven Snakes in all of your capable hands. Hence, you all will have to step up and ensure the Seven Snakes are on track. And don’t you even think about running away.” Kyle shot a sharp glare at Guang Hwa, whose cheerful smile was immediately cut short.</p><p>“Damian, you will speed up recruiting. Establish a second layer below the vipers, known as cobras, to reward associates who have stuck with us since the beginning. Have the best of them become crew leaders, and let them operate independently in a squad hierarchy to reduce overhead administration. We need all the manpower we can get to control the districts.”</p><p>“Keith, prepare the logistics needed to build the weapons factory requested by the baron. This is the first external project that the Golden Snake Construction Company is undertaking—everything needs to go perfectly. We need workers, skilled ones who can drive the weapons factory forward in order to win the supply contract.”</p><p>“Eric, ramp up the production of alcohol and begin storing it. Once the war kicks in, alcohol is going to be highly valued in both Raktor and Versia. Every excess should be accounted for and stored in separate warehouses for future use.”</p><p>“Monica, continue to ensure that our transportation network is working as intended. Feel free to use the funds available to you to expand the fleet and our reach. Start providing regular transportation route services to underserved districts to increase our influence.”</p><p>“Adrian, start contacting black market dealers and keep up to date on any information they might have. We need to know about any event that happens as soon as it happens, no questions asked. Continue to observe the movements of the Wretches, the Red Lions and especially the Ardent Cretins. Track all their high-profile members and make sure we know exactly where they are every time.”</p><p>“Niko, you’re still in charge of security. We need our current districts to be the hallmark of safety. Ensure all our deliveries are on time. If a hijacking of our wagon occurs, make sure to report it to me immediately. Continue to protect our pubs, casinos, and brothels—no-name thug gangs may begin to eye us as easy targets as soon as we announce our project and shift manpower to build the weapons factory.”</p><p>“Gordon, your experience as the factory manager will come in handy, and you will be the overall lead for its production. The current factory will now be converted into the weapons factory. Check the documents that I will give to you later for details on what I intend for the factory to do. The larger the scale that we achieve, the more our influence and reputation will increase.”</p><p>“Speaking of reputation—Reese, you will be in charge of marketing. We want to promote a positive brand image, so work with Guang Hwa on building a public reputation for our companies and district, including the factory. All light-capture films should work towards our districts being known for stability unlike the other violent areas. This way we can pull more people over.”</p><p>Kyle continued to give a few more minor orders before concluding the meeting. “When I took over leadership, I only had one goal in mind—to grow the Seven Snakes into a power that cannot be contested.”</p><p>“Yes, not even the Ardent Cretins will be able to pin us down any longer!” Damian nodded.</p><p>“Forget about the Ardent Cretins—they are insignificant to the bigger plan in the long run. Are you truly satisfied with having just less than a quarter of a small city under your control? Do you not want to grow larger than just a few districts?”</p><p>The rest were shocked at what Kyle had just mentioned. They could barely envision themselves reigning at the top of Raktor. Sure, Damian might have daydreamed about it at some point in his life, but to actually fix it as a goal? </p><p>The word “impossible” appeared in their minds, but yet, for some reason, the very presence of Kyle seemed to defy that impossibility. He seems to be larger than life, an indomitable leader who has led them all this far beyond their wildest dreams. Who among them could imagine having gone toe-to-toe with the Ardent Cretins in an economic war and stayed standing?</p><p>“Not even the entirety of Raktor will be enough for me!” Kyle declared. “Kregol, Perial, the entire Yual Dominion shall fall under my whims alone with due time. And when I’m done with them, not even Versia, Proco, or those hiding beyond the Great Waves can escape my grip!”</p><p>The ambition of Kyle sparked a fire in their hearts, daring them to aim as high as they could. Every notion of obstacles or setbacks was thrown out of their minds, replaced by a zealous belief in Kyle and his leadership. Each of the vipers had their own mindset, but all had aligned to follow Kyle as far as the road would take them.</p><p>“And if you think that is enough for us—that we should be content with having the entire planet respect us—you are wrong. For even the stars themselves will bow before us in due time!”</p><p>Chapter 60: Inkling</p><p><em>Deep underground in an unknown location of Versia…</em></p><p>The sound of panting and grunting filled the wide cavern, with the flashes of metal striking metal glinting through the darkness, illuminating the shadows thrown by the arctech lamps situated all over the ceiling.</p><p>A dozen rock spiders circled and scaled the walls, their red, beady gem-like eyes glinting at the man who was currently being assaulted by three of their brethren. The man heaved as he brandished a sword in each hand, duel-wielding and spinning while he parried each of their strikes.</p><p>The man did not have enough hands to parry, with one spider breaking through and launching a stabbing attack with two of its pointed legs.</p><p>His eyes glowed lightning-blue, with a surge of lightning arcing like a power line down his skin, accelerating his motions to levels impossible. Within a split second, he had accurately stabbed his sword into the red, beady eyes of each of the three spiders.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed “Rock Spider”</p><p></p><p>The rock spiders collapsed with a shriek, their bodies going limp as the man kicked them to the side, his legs bloodied and stained with slimy, dried dirt hardened between his joints. He wiped the sweat off his grimy forehead, grinning to himself as he watched three of the other dozen spiders begin to saunter down toward him, taking the place of their fallen brethren.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Failed</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">You did not manage to kill a dozen spiders within the aforementioned time limit of three minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The trial has been reset.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The man did not pay any attention to the holographic message in front of him, simply swiping it away as he prepared himself for the new round of enemies. The level of skill that he displayed was more than enough to clear the trial with ease, yet for some reason, the man was still stuck here, slowing himself down on purpose.</p><p>A voice called out from the edge of the cavern, showing a servant dressed like an explorer. “Sir Soren, your breakfast is ready.” In front of him were two metal tins filled with what looked like baked beans and a slab of kaya butter on white bread.</p><p>“Almost finished!” the man said through his gritted teeth as he blocked a stab from the spider, parrying it with his lightning-infused sword. Although he had cut the spider’s leg off, he did not finish it. “I forfeit the trial!”</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Forfeited</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Failure is the mother of success. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You may enter the trial again after three hours.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He let out a sigh as the spiders began to back off, retreating back into their holes in the cavern walls. One of them even scampered past the servant, completely avoiding him as it burrowed deep into the wall. “That was a good exercise. If I stay here for three months, I’ll catch up to my siblings in no time!”</p><p>“Sir Soren, need I remind you that the amount of EXP that you are receiving from these spiders will exponentially decay over time? This is not an efficient long-term leveling method. You need to—”</p><p>“Yes, yes, I know. Why are you nagging exactly in the same way as Mother? I’ve been changing dungeons, haven’t I?” Soren scratched his chin as he strutted over, plopping down onto the ground in a crude manner and grabbing the metal tin off the floor along with the kaya bread. “Mmm… Tastes like home. I’m sure glad you came along with me.”</p><p>“I did not have a choice, sir. You used your points to—”</p><p>“—to request your assistance instead of asking for a weapon or a specific posting. Yes, Rayner. I’ve heard the story before; I was there, remember?”</p><p>“And you will do well to remember that I will not help you with the next phase too.”</p><p>“But that can change as well, can it not?” Soren grinned, causing Rayner to sigh in exasperation.</p><p>They soon finished their breakfast, with Soren licking the leftover kaya off his thumb as he picked up his dual swords again. “Well then, round three it is! Statistics!” he declared, checking his stats once more. “Only a bit more to go to the next level.”</p><p>“Sir, the trial will not reset for another two hours. We should find another place first.”</p><p>“You’re right; we can easily clear up some of the mobs nearby.”</p><p>Soren and Rayner packed up their equipment, with Rayner hefting the backpack over while Soren whistled as they trekked down through a derelict hallway.</p><p>The walls were made of brick, covered in moss and algae, which thrived in the damp, moist areas illuminated by the arctech lanterns eternally turned on along the hallways. Countless skeletons lay along the floor, which they gingerly stepped over. A good majority of them were monster skeletons, but a few were distinctively human.</p><p>“Remnants from the Heavenly War, it seems.”</p><p>“Pah, useless old farts. If it weren’t for their incompetence, we would be masters of this world already,” Soren scoffed. “If I had been alive back then, I would have easily turned the tide with just a single blade.”</p><p>“It is good to have such confidence, but perhaps you should work on your foundation first?” Rayner insinuated.</p><p>Soren scowled at Rayner, ignoring him and continuing to walk down the hallway toward a location they had previously marked. The number of skeletons left behind began to decrease sharply as they approached the hallway, causing Rayner to stop Soren for a moment.</p><p>“Be careful. Even the elders of the clan are wary of entering such a place.”</p><p>“Then all the more for the great Soren to show them who’s better! I did not choose you to act like Mother, you know!” Soren berated Rayner, shrugging off the woman’s hand and storming off farther into the hallway.</p><p>They soon reached a large, throne-like room, except it was filled to the brim with rubble, except for the center pathway that was adorned with a stained red carpet, nearly blackened from the soot and dust accumulating over who knows how long.</p><p>On the throne sat a rock golem nearly the size of a small hill. It had four arms along with three crystal eyes embedded into each of its three heads.</p><p>The room shuddered as the rock golem began to shift slightly, the crystal eyes filling up with life as they shone emerald. The rubble around Soren began to form into humanoid shapes, albeit some with additional limbs and many featuring a tail. All of them were made of rocks, consolidating around a single core well protected by various layers of metal.</p><p>“Well then. Good luck, sir. I will see you for lunch.”</p><p>“Thanks, Rayner.” Soren grinned as he brandished his two swords. “All right, bring it on then!” </p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial of the Emperor</p>
