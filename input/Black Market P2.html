<p><h1><a id="_2itr4ecd9eiq"></a>Chapter 7: Scaling</h1></p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>Slavin was gushing over how much money had been made since the introduction of the Stamina Potions. “It’s working like a charm. How are you getting all of these potions?”</p><p>“A new trade secret of the Seven Snakes,” Kyle replied nonchalantly as he tallied the earnings.</p><p>A tidy sum of eight thousand rakels over seven days was a significant boost to their revenue stream. Assuming nothing wrong happened, they were set to make more than forty thousand rakels from this brothel alone every month.</p><p>With the potions, the number of repeat customers had increased, along with word of the brothel spreading. Rumors of the vigorous intensity of the sex workers went viral through the district, prompting even more people to visit them.</p><p>Kyle still had plans to scale this further. “Read this.” He passed a rolled-up parchment over to Slavin, who glanced through it, shock becoming more and more evident on his face as he read.</p><p>“Impressive. Loyalty programs and points will surely make even more customers come in multiple times, especially when you lock the Stamina Potion behind the program,” Slavin remarked with a surprised look, wondering how the young man had so many ideas. The idea was not -unique, but Slavin had never thought of applying it to a brothel, of all things.</p><p>Kyle nodded in response, moving on to the next subject. “With the stamina potions available for your workers, you could have more of them coming in.”</p><p>“Yes, the size of the brothel isn’t enough to accommodate all of them. Even if they were willing to work today, I wouldn’t have a room for them…” Slavin sighed.</p><p>“How much to expand to the next floor?”</p><p>“It won’t cost much—about two thousand rakels a month in rent for the next floor. We’d still have to do a fair amount of work, though—the place was a complete trash pile the last time I saw it. We’ll need movers to clear the floor before I get the construction crew in.”</p><p>“If I get you your movers, how long will it take to construct?”</p><p>“Hmm… a week at most. The cost will be about six thousand rakels if I remember correctly. I’ll have to check with Reyas again.”</p><p>“Approved. Get it done as soon as possible.”</p><p>Returning to the Seven Snakes’ base, Kyle rallied all of the associates, pausing the production of potions as well as the training that had been ongoing for two weeks now. Kyle could already see slight improvements in the physiques of nearly all of his men. Though this was only the beginning of the training, Damian was also shaping up to be much fitter than he was before.</p><p>Kyle glanced at Keith, who was standing at attention. “Have you been training as well?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, though not to such an extent due to my additional duties.”</p><p>Kyle inspected Keith’s body, noticing there was almost no difference between two weeks ago and now. He said nothing, but Keith could already read volumes from his disappointed gaze. Keith had always been one of the weakest in the gang, only kept around because of his prior scholar education as well as being Damian’s younger brother.</p><p>Kyle expected every member to be strong—even his accountants. However, if this was the result of two weeks, Kyle was not expecting any significant improvements on Keith’s part anytime soon.</p><p>“Training will be put on temporary hold. Instead, we will clean out the floor above the brothel to make space for expansion,” Kyle explained.</p><p>“You mean the Lusty Arcian?” Damian’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>“Yes.” Kyle still barely remembered the name of the brothel. It mattered little to him, how much money he could make was the only relevant piece of information. Everything was about economies of scale.</p><p>The associates got ready, moving over to the new floor above the brothel with Damian in the lead. Thanks to Slavin’s connection to the building owner, they immediately got access.</p><p>Damian entered the floor, almost recoiling at the stench. It was clear that a few squatters used to live here, with their refuse and junk all over the place.</p><p>“Be quick! The faster we move, the more money we’ll make! Don’t you want to be rich?!” Damian ordered, issuing tasks and focusing on what to clear first. The doorway was narrow, so some of the more significant trash that had somehow fused together in a burnt slag pile had to be broken apart.</p><p>Over the loud clanging of metal, Damian was overseeing the cleanup diligently, helping out wherever an extra hand was needed. Suddenly, he felt a cold shiver run down his spine as a soothing voice spoke close to his ear, its breath tickling his skin. “Damian, dear, you’ve grown up so fast.”</p><p>Damian immediately launched his elbow at whoever was behind him, only to be stopped by Slavin, who grinned widely. “You used to be such a cute, naïve boy. Now, look at you—underboss of the Seven Snakes.”</p><p>A bright red blush began to appear on Damian’s ears. “That was five years ago. Stop teasing me!”</p><p>“Do you remember when you first came to the brothel a pure soul? Oh, the screams of joy I heard from your room that night…”</p><p>Damian’s face flushed, with a wave of snickering breaking out amongst the others who were clearly listening in. “That was only the first time, all right?”</p><p>“Sure, darling. Oh, look here. What a cutie you are!” Slavin walked up to another associate, grabbing his chin and viewing him from all angles. The associate desperately tried to break free, pulling his head away. However, the grip was rock solid, and his struggles only elicited a smirk from Slavin.</p><p>“You seem to be a new face, and you have great looks. I think you could be the flagship worker for the Lusty Arcian! How about you come work for me? Kyle doesn’t seem to appreciate your talents. You’ll be treated much better here. Customers would love you! And don’t worry; I won’t take all the profits. You’ll get a nice cut.”</p><p><em>Fucking hell, am I getting scouted? </em>While the associate was slightly happy at being praised for his looks, the thought of being a sex worker did not appeal to him. “I-I-I think I’m good,” the associate said with squished cheeks as Slavin let him go.</p><p>The brothel owner frowned slightly. “A pity. Oh? How about you?” His eyes lit up again, locking onto another target to add to his employees.</p><p>The associates worked as fast as they could, spurred on by the harassment of Slavin’s employment advances. Within a single day, the floor was cleared and spotless, allowing the construction crew to begin work on the expansion.</p><p>Kyle remained in his office, calculating the total profit. The bulk purchase of ingredients and flasks made the potions exceedingly cheap. It only cost about twenty-seven rakels per potion at current market rates, which meant that even if he sold them for half the price of what Haui had charged, his profit margin would be tenfold.</p><p>He could sell them for way lower at a profit margin of twofold, but that would draw unwarranted attention and bring him into direct conflict with Haui and perhaps the Alchemists’ Guild. <em>I’m still laying the foundations for my own cartel. We’ll have to play it slow for a while; moving too fast can backfire and deteriorate my standing rapidly.</em></p><p>Instead of selling the potions outright, they were only provided to brothel clientele. Repeat customers could purchase them through the loyalty program, with quantity limited by the number of times they visited.  This ensured that the number of possible leaks will be controlled at the start, allowing him to carefully build up his supply chain with minimal interruptions.</p><p>Kyle glanced at the office table, noting the district map with the gangs’ territories marked out. <em>The Red Lions are our closest neighbor. Hmm…</em></p><p>Kyle called Damian into his office. “It’s been more than two weeks since I took over. I think it is about time.”</p><p>“Time for what?”</p><p>“Expect a few small skirmishes with the Red Lions soon. With the roaring success and rumors of our brothel, it would be surprising to see them take no action at all. Post two associates on rotation to watch for any movements or advances. Should any issues arise, report back to me immediately. Do <em>not </em>fight without me.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Night soon came around again, and this time, the brothel’s queue of customers extended all the way into the alley, with dozens of regulars willing to wait half an hour to get their fix. No one in the queue talked with one another; they were far too focused on getting to the counter.</p><p>Niko was present, having waited about fifteen minutes. His leg continuously shifted as he rubbed his hands, a slight jitter visible in his eyes, which darted around. He scratched his neck feverishly, feeling that constant numb feeling that permeated his jawline and gums as he continuously slackened his jaw.</p><p> He soon made it to the front, meeting Slavin for the second time. “Oh, Niko! Back so soon?”</p><p>Niko scratched the back of his neck and laughed nervously. “Yeah. Haha… Is Ellie around? I would like to have her again—if possible.”</p><p>“Sorry, dear. She’s currently occupied. If you don’t mind waiting a little longer, she’ll be available in… maybe an hour?”</p><p>“That’s fine. I can wait…” Niko’s eyes darted to the Stamina Potions on display behind the counter.</p><p>Slavin caught on, a grin appearing on his face. “The first two were on the house since you were a newcomer. You’ll have to buy the potions through the loyalty program now.” He proceeded to explain the loyalty program.</p><p>Niko instinctively got it—the more one visited, the more they could buy. “This is my second visit, right? So, I can only buy one, right?”</p><p>“Yes, you can. It’s three hundred rakels. Want one?”</p><p>The price was high, but less extravagant than some of the other alchemist shops in other districts. Niko had done his research, and he knew that buying the potion right now would tank his savings tremendously. However, his first time in the brothel was nothing short of a life-changing experience. Slavin could even visibly see Niko begin to radiate more confidence.</p><p>Niko was about to hand over the money when a large commotion broke out at the brothel entrance. An expression of annoyance and anger replaced Slavin’s grin. “Sorry, Niko. I have some ruffians to deal with.” He cracked his knuckles, grabbed a bat from behind the counter, and headed outside.</p><p>Curious about what was unfolding, Niko returned to the stairwell, only noticing that the alleyway had been blocked by more than a dozen men wearing red armbands with the crest of a roaring lion on them. They were split into two groups, covering both ends of the alley.</p><p>“Been hearing all about your good business, pimp!” The captain of the Red Lion’s crew spat on the ground, fiddling with a hammer that had neon red arctech engraving along the head and handle. He was the only one wearing some kind of arctech-infused armor; the rest had basic metal pipes and sticks.</p><p>“It’d be a real shame if some hooligans were to break down and scare away your loyal customers. Perhaps you need protection from someone strong, like me. Name’s Lionel.” A sinister smirk erupted on his face while he performed a mocking bow.</p><p>Niko noticed the queue had thinned. Most of the customers had fled in fear of getting beaten up. Though that was a kink for some, they still preferred to be conscious when it happened. Those who remained were hoping to be compensated with free potions for the inconvenience brought about by the hooligans parading through the alley.</p><p>He contemplated leaving, but it was already too late—he and a few other customers were trapped inside, with Slavin protecting them. Niko felt useless, weak, and incompetent in the face of the Red Lions. <em>What the fuck have I been doing with my life? Working in a dumb factory all day, only to get caught in a fight with no real skills to defend myself with.</em></p><p>“Indeed, a real shame. However, we’re already protected and covered under the Seven Snakes. My apologies, <em>Lionel,</em>” Slavin said eloquently with a tinge of sarcasm, crossing his arms. He was at least a head taller than most of the gang members, but he didn’t intimidate them in the slightest.</p><p>“Seven Snakes? That old, fat pig, Ulon? Bah, he hasn’t left his den in years! Looks like you need a lesson on who calls the shots ‘round here,” Lionel scoffed.</p><p>Slavin remained stoic as their staredown continued. However, deep down, he knew he could not fend off this many fighters from raiding the brothel. <em>The customers will need to escape through one of the other side entrances, but it’ll be far too cramped. </em>His eyes glanced at Niko, who was already trembling as he cowered in the stairwell.</p><p>Before Lionel could order a raid on the establishment, a cry of pain erupted from the Red Lions opposite him. A chaos erupted among the six members, who were seemingly fighting something.</p><p>“Haha! Which idiot decided to interfere?!” Lionel smirked, knowing that his Red Lions members wouldn’t lose to a street thug. Most likely, it was a drunk customer trying to defend the club.</p><p>Any moment now, he would expect to see the beaten-up body of a no-name. Instead, he saw a dismembered limb with the Red Lions armband sail through the air toward him, landing at his feet with a bloody thud. Shock rippled through the Red Lions, but Slavin remained unphased—he knew who was on the other side of the attack.</p><p>“It seems you’re about to receive a lesson yourself.” Slavin grinned, rolling up his sleeves.<h1><a id="_gyjl4ldjnn1l"></a>Chapter 8: Lesson Delivered</h1></p><p>With a confident strut, the brothel manager stepped further into the alleyway, but his grin soon turned into confusion when he saw just a single person—Kyle.</p><p><em>What the… Where’s the rest of the Seven Snakes?</em></p><p>Before he could voice his question, Kyle pummeled a Red Lions thug to the ground. One by one, the members were thrown about as Kyle mowed through them. The brawl was nothing short of a theatrical performance, with groans and the cracking of bodies being broken acting as the soundtrack. If left Slavin with the urge to give a standing ovation to such a picturesque demonstration of prowess and perfection.</p><p>“Who the fuck is that? What are you numbskulls doing? Get him!” Lionel yelled, prompting the Red Lions on his side to charge forward to attack Kyle. However, one of them remained behind, clearly shaken by the brutal display.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?!” Lionel glared at him with a ferocious stare, but even his intimidation couldn’t stop the member from trembling.</p><p>“L-L-Lionel, that’s the guy! That’s the guy!”</p><p>“The guy? What guy? Speak clearly before I smack you!”</p><p>“H-H-He was the one Riker killed before he went missing! It’s a ghost!”</p><p>“What?!” Lionel took another look at the guy who was now somehow fending off three at a time in the narrow alleyway, using not only his arms to parry and fend off incoming strikes but his legs as well, his entire body turned into a weapon as he delivered </p><p>strong kicks that cracked shins and jaws with precision. Already three members were out for the count, one of whom had his limb horribly twisted and bent out of shape by Kyle’s grappling and joint locks.</p><p>Before the others could reinforce the rest, Slavin reached out and grabbed a Red Lions member’s head, smashing it against the nearby wall with a loud, resounding <em>crack</em>. “Can’t just stand around when the boss is in action.”</p><p>The members of the Red Lions jostled about as the backline tried to urge the front forward, but the frontliners were reluctant to face Kyle and Slavin on separate sides.</p><p>“Screw all of you; I’ll show you how it’s done!” Lionel shouted as he shoved the members aside, coming to the front and charging at Slavin first. The neon-red hammer swung wildly at the brothel owner, forcing him to dodge or block with his arms.</p><p>His right forearm took the brunt of a downward strike, but somehow, Slavin withstood the pain, which allowed him to throw an uppercut at Lionel’s chin.</p><p>Lionel backed off instinctively, dodging the incoming fist and swapping the hammer to his left hand. With a sideward swing, he nailed Slavin in the ribs, causing the man to gag and stumble backward.</p><p>Slavin winced as he resumed his fighting stance, but a sharp pain suddenly sprouted from where he’d been hit first on his right forearm, burning through his nerves. It was as if there was lava flowing in his veins at a timed interval. Before he could recover, another pain erupted from his ribs. <em>What?</em></p><p>With a smirk, Lionel exploited the weakness, knowing his hammer’s arctech engraving effect had kicked in. Three more hits landed on Slavin, with the final one crippling his knee, forcing him to the ground. “That’s right! Stay down like the little dog you are. AND YOU. YOU’RE NEX—”</p><p>Lionel was about to taunt the other attacker, but he soon noticed all six of his guys who were fighting Kyle had already been taken out. The last was dangling by the neck, Kyle nearly crushing it before throwing him to the side. The mysterious Seven Snakes fighter had not killed any of them, keeping them barely alive instead.</p><p>Lionel instinctively gulped. Even <em>he </em>didn’t have the confidence or ability to fight off six of his own members at the same time. And the enemy looked like he did it with just an enchanted metal pipe.</p><p>“It’s just one fucker!” Lionel laughed, the fake bravado masking the fear in his heart. “He’s acting strong; he must already be tired or injured by now. GET HIM!”</p><p>The remaining five members hesitated momentarily, but then they noticed Kyle was showing slight signs of exhaustion. “RED LIONS!” one of the members yelled, spurring the rest to charge in tandem.</p><p><em>Good. Now I can stay at the back and make a retreat if necessary</em>. Lionel smirked, moving slightly toward the back.</p><p>As the members rushed forward, Kyle stretched his limbs and massaged his sore shoulders. “A good warm-up. It’s been a while since I went to town.”</p><p>The first attacker approached, and Kyle threw his enchanted metal pipe into the air instead of preparing to parry.</p><p>“What…?” The attacker glanced upward, distracted by the soaring metal pipe, before a palm strike from Kyle caved in his lower jaw. The world spun as Kyle wrestled him, tossing him onto the ground.</p><p>Two more attackers rushed him from both sides, with Kyle dodging the first hit with a sidestep and grabbing the wrist of the second attacker, tugging him with a skillful spin. In a blink, Kyle spun around and used his body weight to slam them into each other, sending the men toppling to the ground. Kyle followed up by stomping hard on his groin, and the man let out an otherworldly sound.</p><p>One last brave attacker charged Kyle, but the pipe had finally fallen, smacking him right in the back of his head. Disoriented, he was no match for Kyle’s swift kicks and punches, forcing him to drop to one knee. The Seven Snakes gang leader delivered a spinning kick, concussing him.</p><p>“Fucking hell. He’s not wearing any enchanted gear either!” Lionel was panicking now, preparing to retreat. He began to walk to the other exit, only to find Damian and the rest of the Seven Snakes waiting for him patiently.</p><p>“The lesson ain’t over yet, Lionel.” Damian grinned widely.</p><p>On the roof of the flanking building, a lone civilian intently watched the battle, jotting down notes and observing through the pulsating pipes. His eyes focused only on Kyle as the man subjugated the rest of the Red Lions, writing down the observed strength and reaction of the Seven Snakes members.<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>“Didn’t know you were that strong.” Slavin flinched as Damian treated his wounds.</p><p><em>This is nothing compared to what I was previously capable of, </em>Kyle thought. “I’m far from strong. It’s not about strength; it’s about knowing how to use your body,” he replied nonchalantly.</p><p>Slavin obviously didn’t believe him after witnessing what he was capable of, but Kyle sincerely believed what he said. The two watched the Seven Snakes members tie up the Red Lions. They were now slumped against the side, Lionel’s face barely recognizable.</p><p>Kyle had explicitly ordered the Seven Snakes to keep all of them alive. Kyle held Lionel’s armor piece and hammer in his hands.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Breastplate of Nullification (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>I should learn how these types of equipment are made</em>. Kyle made a mental note to ask Damian later. They seemed to be the primary way the locals of this world fought at a higher level than ordinary humans in his previous life. <em>Doesn’t seem too prolific either; it might be another market to exploit</em>.</p><p>“Sir, what are we going to do with them?”</p><p>“Haul them into the holding cell and feed each of them a Euria-enhanced Stamina Potion. Give them three a day, then stop for four days.”</p><p>Damian didn’t understand why Kyle was giving away his product for free when it could be sold for twice its cost through the brothel. Nevertheless, he nodded and followed orders. “Does that apply to Riker as well?”</p><p>“No, don’t touch him. I have a special plan for him.”</p><p>An arctech wagon suddenly drove up near the brothel entrance, and four local enforcers stepped out. They saw the Red Lions members tied up and Kyle ordering the Seven Snakes associates around.</p><p>Kyle glanced over his shoulder to see an enforcer wearing a captain’s cap, approaching him.</p><p>“Seems the rumor of Ulon dying was true. Been a while since I’ve seen the Seven Snakes this coordinated,” the captain remarked as he looked at the scene with clear disinterest. Even the blood oozing and snaking toward the tip of his metal sole barely fazed him, as though gang fights were extremely common in the city.</p><p>Kyle reached into his suit pocket, retrieving a thick, pre-prepared envelope and slipping it into the enforcer’s pocket. “Just a minor scuffle between friends. That’s all,” Kyle said softly before patting the shoulder of the captain.</p><p>“Indeed, just a minor scuffle. Nothing to see here. I suppose we’ll be seeing more of this, though?” The captain didn't smile just yet, refusing to budge.</p><p>Kyle sighed, retrieved another envelope, and slid it into the enforcer’s pocket as well. “Yes, there will be more of this in the future. You shouldn’t waste your precious time tending to such minor incidents. Spend that time with your families. Life is more important, is it not?”</p><p>“Indeed, it is. You have a good day, sir.” The enforcer captain grinned as he adjusted his pockets and tipped his cap before leaving with his squad.</p><p>Kyle soon left along with the prisoners, leaving Niko and the rest of the customers staring in awe. “Holy shit! Did you see that? Who the hell was that? I don’t remember Seven Snakes having such a strong leader. Even the enforcers turned a blind eye.”</p><p>“Yeah, that was amazing. I think the Red Lions might seriously be in trouble at this rate.”</p><p>“That kid can’t hold a candle to Red Lion, not even the Left Paw himself! I’ve seen him in action recently; man’s a monster. If you thought this was cool, you ain’t seen nothing yet.”</p><p>Slavin cleared his throat, motioning for the customers to return to the brothel. The sex workers and other customers who had “finished” during the commotion had peeked their heads out of the windows to witness Kyle’s spectacle.</p><p>“That man is the new head of Seven Snakes,” Slavin said proudly. “You’d better expect some big changes around here. And to those of you who were planning on stealing from us, think again.”</p><p>Niko was completely amazed. The way the Seven Snakes had appeared was far too cool, as well as the performance from Kyle. Could he even join a gang like that?</p><p>Back at their base, Kyle grimaced in his room as he removed his shirt. As intimidating as he looked, he couldn’t avoid a few hits, and bruises were now forming in those areas.</p><p>The Necklace of Healing provided some much-needed relief, slowly but surely restoring his HP back to full, with a ten-second cooldown. A quick swig of a Stamina Potion also relaxed his muscles. <em>Might be time to make some healing potions. I’ll have to discover the recipe again in a similar fashion. Shouldn’t be too hard.</em></p><p>Before the night ended, he called all of the associates into the common area. “Great work out there. However, this is only the first of many skirmishes,” Kyle warned. “Starting tomorrow, we’ll be focusing on combat training on top of the existing physical training program. I will be teaching all of you directly.”</p><p>Murmurs spread through the associates. The brave gang member who had been knocked unconscious smiled with expectation, hoping to prove himself against Kyle.</p><p>“Shit, he’s teaching us directly? Since when do gang leaders do that?” another associate whispered to his friend.</p><p>“Fuck yeah! I want to be as strong as him. Maybe one day I’ll duel him and win.”</p><p>Kyle overheard that, grinning. “You can try. But before you continue dreaming, I’ll provide a demonstration to mentally prepare you.”</p><p>Kyle led the confused associates to a spare room, where a single Red Lions prisoner was tied up on a chair. He grabbed a nearby Euria-enhanced potion, forcing the liquid down the prisoner’s throat. He then used the Necklace of Healing on him slowly, healing the prisoner to full health over a minute.</p><p>“Wha… What’s going on?” The Red Lions prisoner was stunned. Was his captor saving him?</p><p>Kyle cut the ropes, allowing the man to move about. He turned to face the Seven Snakes’ associates. “Since I took over, I noticed a clear lack of brutality in the way we fight, especially last night. Too hesitant. Too slow.”</p><p>Before the prisoner could react, Kyle spun around and delivered a forceful elbow strike into his nose, causing blood to spurt out and him to collapse on the ground, writhing in pain. The associates were shocked at the sudden outburst of violence but were soon reminded of how Kyle had gotten into his position in the first place.</p><p>“Demonstration over. Tomorrow morning, each of you will take turns beating him up.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>In another district of the South Sector, a notebook was being read by a well-dressed gentleman as he paced slowly through a large dining hall filled with people enjoying a grand feast. The candlelight and extravagant furniture were only contrasted with the lack of manners each of the diners had, eating like hooligans at a campfire. Food and liquids were tossed about.</p><p>“The Ilysian Punks and the Red Lions seem to be neck to neck, while the Wretches are still treating their wounds from the last three-way war…” the man muttered to himself as he trawled through the observer’s logs.</p><p>“SEBASTIAN!” a voice bellowed from the far end of the long dining table. Everyone stopped to listen. “Why are you still working?! The Ardent Cretins don’t pay for overtime, you know?” A chorus of laughter erupted from the rest of the diners as a large man stood up and walked forwards.</p><p>Sebastian bowed respectfully, holding the book to his chest. “Sir, as the dominator of the South Sector, it is essential to observe and keep track of every movement within that can potentially threaten our reign.”</p><p>“Yes, but currently, none of the other gangs in the South Sector can match our sheer strength. Ten districts now, with even more to come! Even if we lose every member, there’s still me. I alone rule the whole damn place! ISN’T THAT RIGHT, BOYS?!”</p><p>“YES, SIR! ARES IS THE STRONGEST IN THE SOUTH!” the Ardent Cretins chanted in response, having practiced it often.</p><p>“Damn right I am.” Ares nodded with satisfaction. “Now, work is important, but I order you to eat with us!”</p><p>Sebastian begrudgingly dragged his feet to an open seat, plopping down on the bench while the others feasted on the scrumptious food before them.</p><p>However, the notebook was still open on his lap, with Sebastian glancing at it occasionally. A log near the end caught his eye.</p><p><em>Seven Snakes has a new leader, and he beat up a dozen Red Lions alone, with no arctech equipment. Further observations will be needed. Perhaps a talk is necessary to soothe ambitions.</em></p><p>“This will be a problem.”<h1><a id="_z6z23pnzsdkz"></a>Chapter 9: Red Lion</h1></p><p>“SEVEN SNAKES! COME OUT!” a man clad in reddish armor bellowed outside the Seven Snakes’ base, attracting the attention of many passersby. He was flanked by a dozen lightly armored individuals, all bearing the insignia of the Red Lions.</p><p>Many of the onlookers watched intently from a safe distance. It had been barely a day since the battle in the alleyway, but the word of Kyle’s prowess had already spread through the district. It was no surprise that the Red Lions would come to harass the Seven Snakes after such a harrowing defeat.</p><p>The man continued yelling. “COME OUT NOW! OR ARE YOU TOO SCARED TO DEFEND YOUR OWN TURF?”</p><p>Suddenly, the entrance to the base swung open, revealing a disgruntled Kyle who had just woken up, his eyes slightly closed. “Who are you?” he asked.</p><p>The man was stumped for only a brief moment before cackling loudly. Every movement of his seemed to be geared toward showmanship, showing off his equipment and his dominance over the ordinarily dressed Kyle.</p><p>Kyle squinted. <em>He’s putting on a performance for reputation and rumors. Typical.</em></p><p>“Don’t you know? I am the great Wrent, Left Paw of the Red Lions! It seems you’ve been taking good care of my boys.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And?” Wrent’s eyebrows twitched at the defiant tone, but he resumed his haughty attitude. “I believe <em>you </em>are keeping them prisoner, and <em>we </em>would like them back. I’m sure you wouldn’t want to cause an incident on this fine day, would you?”</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How much would it cost in rakels to buy your members?”</p><p>Wrent’s expression darkened. “Are you implying that we, the honorable Red Lions, would ever be willing to sell our—” A dark-yellow potion sailed through the air, with Wrent stumbling to catch it.</p><p>Just as he was about to berate Kyle for tossing random objects at him, he took another look at the item in question, staring intently. “This is… a Stamina Potion!” Wrent was no fool—he had already heard rumors of the Seven Snakes selling them through the brothel.</p><p>“There’s more where that came from. How many would suffice?”</p><p>Wrent coughed, his eyes darting around. “Perhaps it would be best if we discussed this inside, away from prying eyes.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The two of them entered the office, with Damian standing guard outside.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Ulon to fall so soon,” Wrent remarked. He glanced around the room and saw most of the usual ornaments that Ulon had loved to flaunt were missing. “Did you come from another gang? I don’t recall seeing anyone like you around.”</p><p>“No, I have been in the gang for a while now. I just felt I could do better,” Kyle replied, his back exposed to Wrent, who was eyeing him like a predator.</p><p>“Are you not afraid I would kill you right here?” Wrent sneered, his right hand slightly rubbing the pommel of an engraved, ruby-encrusted sword with a wide grin. </p><p>“You can try, if you want. I’m sure it’ll do wonders for your reputation,” Kyle replied apathetically, not the least afraid. </p><p>The sheer confidence exuded by Kyle frightened Wrent, causing him to be markedly more cautious. <em>This man isn’t the same as Ulon. The slow method may not work for him. I’ll have to fleece him as much as I can. There’s no way the debt Ulon racked up is gone within less than two weeks. I know they still owe a million to the Crimson Swords.</em></p><p>Wrent ran his hands over the arm of the guest chair before removing his sword belt and sitting down. “Perhaps your death does not affect my reputation as much as you think. No one knows you’re the new leader yet.”</p><p>“Enough posturing. We’re both businessmen here. Let’s get to the point. How many?” Kyle began.</p><p><em>He has an intelligent head on his shoulder, and he immediately knew from the start that I didn’t care about the prisoners. A dumber gang leader would have refused based on pride. If we weren’t enemies, I would have recruited him right away.</em> Wrent was never worried about the prisoners. Kyle could kill them for all he cared, as long as he got “compensation.” The Red Lions were a business, not a group based on friendship.</p><p>Wrent still had interest in how Kyle was getting so many potions. He had heard the reports of the brothel giving potions to their loyal customers, which prompted him to send a dozen members in the first place. Of course, he planned to use his weight to pressure Kyle into giving him more potions than was reasonable. The Red Lions could then easily sell them off in a heartbeat or use it in their own training. </p><p>Wrent tried to pry deeper. “You’re not getting these potions from Haui, are you?”</p><p>“That’s a trade secret. How many?”</p><p>Wrent remained silent for a moment, calculating in his head. <em>A ridiculous amount should suffice. If he rejects, it’ll tank his reputation, and I’ll increase the rate of harassment whether or not he releases the prisoners. If he accepts, the gang will be financially ruined, and it’ll be an easy win.</em></p><p>“Five hundred Stamina Potions,” Wrent declared. Based on Haui’s pricing scheme, it was close to three hundred thousand rakels’ worth of potions. With Seven Snakes in debt, it was nearly impossible for them to even have that much in stock.</p><p>“Done. You’ll have your full stock in ten days. Let me draft a contract.” Kyle retrieved a placeholder contract, filling in the details before handing it over to Wrent for inspection. </p><p><em>He caved that easily? The potions are worth three hundred thousand! Is he stealing them from an alchemist I’ve never heard of?</em></p><p>Wrent was still stunned when he read the contract. He checked over the clauses carefully, noting that everything was in order. “A non-aggression pact over the course of the contract…” This meant the Red Lions could not attack the Seven Snakes as long as they adhered to the contract terms. <em>Are my members really that valuable to him? What is he using them for?</em></p><p>As much as they were criminal gangs profiteering from illegal goods, contracts between gangs had to be adhered to—it was an issue of reputation. Any gang that thoughtlessly broke a truce or ceasefire would immediately lose the trust of both the people and other gangs, throwing them into isolation. Even merchants wouldn't dare trade with them unless coerced by force. Going against a contract signed willingly was a surefire way to have enemies gang up against the one who broke the contract. </p><p>Three hundred thousand rakels’ worth of potions was an eye-watering sum to Wrent, and he was basically getting it for free. “I accept.” Wrent readily signed the agreement. <em>The non-aggression pact is but a façade. The real war is fought on the open market with our businesses. If he’s as smart as I think he is, I’ll need to expedite my plan.</em></p><p>“Good. Each day at dusk, send five people to collect fifty potions at this meeting point. Pleasure doing business with you.” Kyle led Wrent out. </p><p>When Wrent left, he let out a hearty laugh, attracting onlookers who were curious about the resolution. “Seems like you got a good head on your shoulders, Seven Snakes. Smart of you to appease us so readily. Let’s move out!” He ordered his men to march back to their district. </p><p><em>A showman through and through. </em>Kyle returned to the common room, noticing a worried Damian on the side. “Sir, what was the agreement? Did we go into more debt?”</p><p>“A ten-day truce, along with fifty potions delivered a day.”</p><p>Damian was equally shocked, but not for the same reasons as Wrent was. “What? That’s it? We churn out two hundred a day, even while training!”</p><p>“It’s their loss. This gives us time to prepare, though we must shore up our finances. We’ll begin combat training immediately—we’re on a timer now. For the potions, make sure the first three deliveries are not Euria-infused. We will only infuse them randomly from the fourth day onward. Don’t want their alchemist to spot too much.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Kyle acted as an instructor for the rest of the morning, teaching the associates fighting skills. He used the prisoners as dummies, sending the associates in one by one to beat them up while continuously healing them. The rest were divided into sparring pairs. Kyle focused on sparring with Damian, drilling fighting basics into him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Healer (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>After lunch, Damian led the training, allowing Kyle to focus on preparing for the end of the truce. There was no doubt in his mind that the Red Lions would begin to pressure them now that they were well aware of their ability to produce this many potions. <em>As long as we can hold on for three days after the end of the truce, it’s a win for us.</em></p><p>Keith was in Kyle’s office, racking his brains over the gang’s finances and equipment, his head resting in his hands. “Is it doable?” Kyle asked.</p><p>“To get a similar armor set like the Red Lions? I don’t think so. It’s far too expensive.”</p><p>“Hmm…” Kyle pondered. He needed to boost the combat capability of his men before the fight broke out. If they couldn’t procure enchanted armor, what other methods did he have? </p><p>“Keith, one more task for you. Set up an induction program for new members and procure a few armbands with the logo of the Seven Snakes on them. Have it done by tomorrow.”</p><p>“New members?! We’re so tiny. Who would even want to join us?”</p><p>Kyle glared at his underling, who immediately zipped his mouth and nodded.</p><p><em>More members can help bulk up our numbers, but we need a qualitative improvement across the board. </em>Combat training could only last for ten days—not long enough to drill proper fighting skills into the associates. Sure, the physical training regimen had been running for two weeks, but that didn’t directly translate into fighting potential. Kyle needed instantaneous improvements.</p><p>His mind thought about the game-like interface that he now had. Killing people would earn him free stat points and even titles occasionally. However, the points only gave him a slight marginal benefit. It wasn’t worth the potential consequence of enforcers breathing down his neck for random murders happening across the sector—even <em>he </em>didn’t think he could cover up every kill.</p><p>The number of people he would have to kill in ten days would be cataclysmic to reach a level where he could take on the entirety of the Red Lions. He needed something different. </p><p>The main way to solve this would be to get more potions, but as it stood, there was no chance in hell that Haui had not heard about the deal with the Red Lions or the Lusty Arcian selling cheap stamina potions for repeat customers. With the absurd number of potions being supplied for “free,” the local market for potions must have been in peril by now. </p><p>Kyle decided to tackle this problem head-on, bringing a few associates to visit Haui’s shop. He stood just beyond the defensive line of arcia traps that surrounded the alchemist’s house, while the private guards immediately came out, brandishing their swords and maces, ready to fight.</p><p>The locals around the food market scampered away, afraid of getting caught in the ensuing fight, while a few brave souls remained to watch the outcome. Even the local enforcers didn’t dare get in between, keeping a clear distance as they carefully observed, reporting the meeting to their superiors.</p><p>Haui stepped out of the store in his alchemist robes. “I was expecting you to come soon. Are you planning to raze or to negotiate?” <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">* * *</p>

<p></p><p><h1><a id="_inzgl482oy8b"></a>Chapter 10: Negotiations</h1></p><p>“To negotiate, of course.” Kyle spoke clearly, causing Haui to raise his eyebrows.</p><p>“I don’t think one needs seven gang members to perform a rudimentary negotiation.”</p><p>“Negotiations require an even playing field.” Kyle nodded his head at the guards.</p><p>A smirk appeared on Haui’s face, his expression confident. “I doubt your members are as prepared as my private guards. Are you sure these are the only guards I have prepared?”</p><p>“Then you would just have to account for me as well.”</p><p>The two stared at each other for a brief moment before Haui finally broke into laughter. “Very good. Come in.”</p><p>The two of them entered the store, with the gang members and the guards staring each other down outside.</p><p>“I must say, I did not expect you to be the leader of the Seven Snakes gang. I merely thought Damian was paid a few rakels to escort a foreign individual of note around, seeing as how he had to explain everything to you.” Haui sat behind the counter, arranging his robes.</p><p>“I did not expect you to have paid for observers around the district.” Kyle paced around the store slowly, looking at some of the potions he had not examined the last time he came.</p><p>“The Seven Snakes can’t be the only ones patrolling around, can they? My business depends on who runs the district. But let’s cut the crap.” Haui’s demeanor suddenly changed, his eyes glaring with ferocity. “You’ve been undercutting my potions through the brothel and are now flooding the market with knockoffs via the Red Lions. Even if Wrent is from another district, the fluctuations in market price would directly affect me and upset the established rule of the Alchemists’ Guild.”</p><p>Haui stood up and paced around, picking up a chisel and twirling it in his hands. “There were a myriad of ways I could have gone about this. The moment I heard about the brothel providing half-priced stamina potions through a… ‘loyalty’ program, I contemplated an assassination or a kidnapping.”</p><p>“But you didn’t.”</p><p>“Indeed. I understand that for you to reverse-engineer my potions that fast, you must have an extremely impressive ability to decipher the closely guarded recipes of the Alchemists’ Guild without external help. Maybe even a device that can do it for you,” Haui replied. “And the mass-production scale is on the level of factories, something the Alchemists’ Guild is clamping down hard on to maintain the high price margins. As such, you are extremely valuable as long as you are able to evade detection. If I sent anyone to kill you, it would be a loss for me. I don’t believe any organization I hire would be willing to kill you if they found out the true reason behind the contract.” Haui sighed.</p><p>“And I can’t kill you myself because you are extremely well protected. I doubt this is the full extent of your security forces as well. I would not want to anger the Alchemists’ Guild either,” Kyle replied. This was why he didn’t just run over and kill Haui—it was far too costly, and he didn’t know the full extent of Haui’s backing.</p><p>Haui was a bit surprised before a broad smile appeared on his face. “It appears that we are quite alike, you and me. Neither party can truly eliminate the other. Even if we try to, the consequences would be far too brutal. So here we are.”</p><p>“What’s your proposal?”</p><p>“From my observations, you can’t create new potion recipes, as you don’t have formal alchemist training or connections. However, your competence with reverse-engineering and mass production gives me great insight into how to target a wider audience and potentially profit off the common people, not just the upper middle class or leaders of gangs. How about this—for every potion you reverse-engineer from me, you must give me half of the profits indefinitely.”</p><p>Kyle’s eyebrow twitched slightly. Asking for half was daylight robbery. “A tenth. And you must tell me the recipes.”</p><p>Both of them smirked, knowing they had entered the negotiation phase. </p><p>“The recipes are strictly off-limits. I am bound by code through the Alchemists’ Guild never to reveal such information to non-members. It spoils the market for other alchemists, you see. Even mass production is a no-go. However, the reason I ask for half is that I am willing to shelter you from the guild as well, by claiming you are my ‘associate.’ The recipes will still be off-limits, but you will not suffer repercussions. In exchange, the mass-produced potions must be of a lower quality to truly evade a deep investigation from the guild.”</p><p><em>Quality? Is he referring to the “Basic” tag on the potions? </em>Even if he rejected Haui now and went to another alchemist’s shop to purchase potions,  the Alchemists’ Guild would eventually catch onto him as well, seeing how good Haui’s informant network was.</p><p>“Fine. Two-tenths, but only for a year after for each potion type.” </p><p>“Ridiculous. Four-tenths, for three years,” Haui countered.</p><p>“Two-tenths, two years.”</p><p>“Three-tenths, four years.”</p><p>“Two-tenths, two years.” Kyle was not budging anymore. </p><p>“Fine. Deal.” Haui drafted a simple contract on parchment, passing it to Kyle to sign. A non-aggression clause was in there as well, to ensure neither party tried to backstab each other. They still could, but then it would be a breach of the contract.</p><p>Contracts between criminals were less of a legal requirement and more of a justification for retaliation. Kyle also didn’t want to earn a bad reputation for breaking a contract or pact he signed—Ulon had already done enough damage. Similarly, Haui also had a reputation to uphold. </p><p>There was another clause where Haui had the right to determine what potion recipes to give Kyle. “You must understand that the more exquisite potions are heavily guarded recipes of the guild. Under no circumstances can we mass-produce this without having a strong-enough power base.”</p><p>“You make it sound like we are already partners.”</p><p>“Of course. Your profit is mine as well.” Haui smiled. He had obtained Kyle as a future distribution network—a free money flow. </p><p>Kyle didn’t lose much either. In exchange for money, he had gained a direct source of essential potion recipes and protection from the Alchemists’ Guild. </p><p>“Well then, with the Red Lions now well aware of your mass production capabilities and you imprisoning their members, there’s no doubt a fight will come. May I suggest this potion? Again, I cannot provide you with the recipe.” Haui handed over two potions: the first being a glossy, indigo flask with a tinge of red swirling within the liquid.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Strength Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Boost muscle strength for a short duration. Good for quick battles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle nodded, taking a few potions. He didn’t need to pay Haui, as he had already provided twenty percent of the profits.</p><p>The men walked to the store entrance before Haui stopped Kyle. “A fair warning—the Ardent Cretins already have an observer watching this district. They are always watching. Do not act too overtly if you want to remain under the radar. I’d prefer it if another gang didn’t steal you away just yet. If you’re going to sell potions, do not oversupply like you did for the Red Lions. That alone might already cause the Alchemists’ Guild to start asking too many questions. Keep any subsequent contracts below a hundred for now.”</p><p>Haui and Kyle stepped outside, only to see the gang members and the private guards about ready to come to blows. They were throwing insults with wanton abandon. Haui sighed and called the private guards back.</p><p>The gang members were astonished even as the fight broke up. Today was a day of surprises, seeing how Kyle had successfully negotiated with two separate individuals.</p><p>“Hey, I thought Alv—Kyle was all about beating people up? I was almost certain I would see Haui beaten into a pulp.”</p><p>“Yeah, not sure what has gotten into him.”</p><p>Kyle ordered the gang members to return with him. As he walked, he noticed a lone local enforcer of the Sanctum eyeing him carefully. <em>The enforcers seemed to be on to me as well. </em></p><p>With so many major powers watching him, every action he took from now on had to be measured. Haui was right in that he was indeed planning to sell more potions, but he now had to limit the supply.</p><p>This also meant that prices would need to be in line with the current market. With this, Haui’s profit margin for the basic potions would still be fairly secured.</p><p><em>He sure is crafty.</em> <em>I must find a way to either get rid of him or integrate him into the gang. The Alchemists’ Guild must be extremely dangerous if every alchemist is like this.</em></p><p>Returning to the Seven Snakes’ base, Kyle began his potion discovery process, attempting to master the strength potion recipe. More ingredients were involved, so he tried everything he could think of. </p><p>With a simple distillation process, he managed to separate the liquid from the dissolved Greis Powder, though another material sludge was mixed into the residue. He grabbed the flask of residue, examining it.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Residue of Strength Potion</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>“First step completed.”<h1><a id="_8bs846uo177g"></a>Chapter 11: Addiction Symptoms</h1></p><p>The training routine went as planned. The main reason why Kyle wanted so many prisoners was due to the mental trauma inflicted on each prisoner after combat training. No prisoner could remain sane after being beaten up by twenty gang members in a row while continuously being healed. </p><p>“JUST LET ME DIE!” One of the Red Lions prisoners shook the coarse shoddyiron bars of his temporary jail violently. They were segregated into separate cages, ensuring they couldn’t help each other break out. </p><p>“Shut up, idiot. They can’t even hear you from inside this room,” Lionel grumbled. It had only been a day since they had been imprisoned, but a few of the members’ mental states were at an all-time low. </p><p>There was someone else in the room who clearly had it much worse, judging by the continuous groaning, the scratching of nails against rusted metal, and clattering of teeth. Lionel glanced over at Riker’s cage to see him lying on the floor in a cold sweat, shivering. </p><p>He wasn’t particularly surprised to see Riker here after they were captured. Kyle was that strong, after all, so he didn’t expect Riker to escape either.</p><p>“Fucking hell. What did they do to you? Potion overdose?” Lionel asked, but Riker barely registered the question, only turning and tossing about on the cold metal surface. </p><p>At this moment, the main door to the room opened, revealing Kyle flanked by Damian.</p><p>Immediately, the other Red Lions members started cursing and swearing at Kyle, blasting them with everything they had ever learned in their short lives within Raktor. Kyle simply raised an eyebrow at some of the more colorful expressions they had for him while Damian was lugging a sack of Stamina Potions, giving them one each. </p><p>Lionel grabbed a potion, still astonished at how many the Seven Snakes had. This was the third one they’d received since their imprisonment. Going by Haui’s price, it meant Kyle had spent more than 1,800 rakels on each prisoner. <em>Is this guy loaded or what?</em></p><p>He noticed Damian didn’t give Riker any Stamina Potions, but the moment Riker saw the potion in his hand, he turned into some sort of feral beast, lunging for it. The bars barely restrained him as Riker forced his arm through, trying to reach Lionel. </p><p>“How many days has it been?” Kyle asked Damian.</p><p>“About four full days since we stopped, sir.”</p><p>“Hmm… He still seems a bit too feisty. Open the cage.”</p><p>Damian carried out the order. Riker pounced on Kyle, but the gang leader immediately parried his attacks and flipped him onto the ground, slamming him down hard. </p><p>Riker gagged, a slight froth coming from his mouth, but he was far too weak to sit up. Lionel could tell Riker had not eaten for a day or so; the food platter was still filled in the cage. Riker had barely touched it.</p><p>Kyle dragged Riker away from the room, Damian shutting the door behind them. A cold shiver ran down Lionel’s spine. <em>What in the world are they attempting?</em></p><p>Riker was tossed into an empty room and tied down to a wooden chair, Kyle being the only other person inside. </p><p>“How are you feeling?”</p><p>“F… Fuck you…” Riker was still in a cold sweat, his eyes bloodshot as he tried to keep his head up. </p><p>Kyle placed his hands on Riker’s shoulder, who began to struggle but was unable to break free of the ropes and Kyle’s iron grip.</p><p>“Inspect. Analyze. Identify.”</p><p>Nothing appeared. </p><p>“Interesting.” Kyle thought he might have been able to see a statistical table of Riker or at least a status effect of some sort, but they did not exist. He tried a few more words, but nothing happened. <em>Hmm…</em></p><p>He began to examine Riker carefully, checking his eye reactions, heartbeat, pulse, and so on. <em>If only I had a full medical wing here. A side project for the future.</em></p><p><em>Noted symptoms: Increased heart rate, sweating, hot and cold flashes, hallucinations, and perhaps loss of vision, not unlike dehydration.</em></p><p>“Riker.” Kyle stood in front of him, snapping his fingers to catch the prisoner’s attention. </p><p>“If you defeat me now, I’ll let you go and give you this potion.” Kyle pulled a Stamina Potion from his suit’s inner pocket.</p><p>Riker’s eyes were suddenly rejuvenated with life, and his head nodded vigorously. As soon as Kyle removed the ropes, Riker attacked without hesitation. </p><p>Kyle did not counter-attack this time, merely dodging left and right as he observed Riker’s muscle movements and reaction timing. <em>Too slow, too weak, lack of awareness. A shadow of his former self. Perfect.</em></p><p>“I’ve seen enough.” </p><p>“N-No, wait. P-Please!” His hands tried to grab onto Kyle, missing completely as he collapsed onto the floor. Kyle tied him up again with ease and returned him to his cage.</p><p>Damian and Keith waited for him in the office.</p><p>“Continue to feed Riker, but do not give him any more Euria-infused potions.” Kyle plopped down into his chair. “Moving forward, we will split the remainder of the prisoners into three groups: not infused potions, Euria-infused potions administered non-stop, and Euria-infused potions only administered on the first day.</p><p>Each gang member will rotate and defeat one of each group every day in combat. At the end of the day, I’ll heal all of them. Got it?”</p><p>Damian nodded, leaving the room to pass down the modified training regimen. </p><p>“Sir, a few people have shown up at the entrance, wanting to join the Seven Snakes,” Keith informed.</p><p><em>Faster than I expected. </em>“Have them gather in my office as soon as possible.”</p><p>Ten young men rushed in soon after. They lined up, their eyes eager as they stared at Kyle. Niko was among them, having quit his factory job after witnessing Kyle’s performance first-hand, completely enamored by the prospect of gang life and strength. How could he accept languishing in mediocrity when greatness was right in front of him?</p><p>Kyle recognized most of them as onlookers from his fight with the Red Lions. He got up from his chair and inspected them for any irregularities. As he returned to the first of them, he suddenly launched a high kick towards the man’s face, only stopping mere millimeters away from it. The man barely had time to react, only stumbling a step backward a few moments later.</p><p>“If you’re here, you know what you’re signing up for. Death is a real possibility.” Kyle returned to his standing position. “I am not looking for men who simply want to take it easy or boss others around. Mutual loyalty is an integral part of how I run our group. Do right by me, and I’ll do the same for you, no matter what happens.”</p><p><em>I was right to come here! </em>Niko’s heart swelled with happiness, his fist clenching as he praised himself for making the right choice. His prior factory job was soulless, with the manager barely caring if anyone died or went missing. They were just numbers to be replaced. Kyle’s words had struck a chord with Niko, causing him and a few others to nod their heads vigorously.</p><p>Kyle’s modus operandi for the Seven Snakes was vastly different from the Red Lions’. His former life as a galactic crime lord had taught him an important lesson in fostering loyalty among even the lowest of members. </p><p>He did not do it because he was nice. Conversely, he had identified this method as the most secure in preventing betrayals. Something he did not do very well in his former life. </p><p><em>Performing a small beneficial action that is ultimately meaningless to me will mean a great deal to the recipient and will build loyalty over time. A minute cost for a great benefit.</em> Kyle gently smiled as he noticed the expressions on their faces. </p><p>“There is a war with the Red Lions coming in about ten to thirteen days. If anyone wants to back out now, this is your last chance,” Kyle said, his eyes cold and serious. </p><p>None of them backed out, standing firmly. All of them knew of the conflict. For some, it was why they had signed up in the first place. It meant a chance to get into a good position with the winning side, and everyone here knew exactly who was about to win.</p><p>“Good. Keith will now induct you. At the end, I will present each of you with an armband as associates.” Kyle showed them the Seven Snakes armband bearing an elaborate crest. </p><p>A clear wave of excitement rippled through the ten men. <em>Formal ceremonies to make them feel important are also critical to retaining loyalty. </em></p><p>The men left the office with Keith in the lead to give them a tour of the base. Kyle headed to the kitchen again, this time staring at the strength potion that now had its full description.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Strength Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Boost muscle strength for a short duration. Good for quick battles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Recommended Usage</strong>: Drink the entire flask in one go. Active for five minutes. Consuming another within a day will result in diminishing effects. May experience side effects after the main effect wears off. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Greis Powder, Olio Roots, Yul’s Tears, Water. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He sent two members to collect the required materials—Olio Roots and Yul’s Tears—which came separately in a sack and pot. </p><p>Kyle’s face scrunched at the reported price of the Yul’s Tears. A five kilogram pot was more than ten thousand rakels. <em>I only hope the recipe isn’t too intensive on the percentage of Yul’s Tears used…</em></p><p>He internally cursed the Alchemists’ Guild and Haui for not providing the recipe. However, Kyle was cognizant that he would have done the same. Recipes and methods of production were far too precious to be freely distributed in this kind of city.</p><p>The same brute-force method was employed as the last time, but with more than four ingredients in the mix, the number of potential combinations was a lot higher. Kyle brought in a few helpers to speed up the process, utilizing the numerous arcite stoves to iterate continually.</p><p>At one point, he had more than ten flasks going. He wrote down combinations on parchment, and crossed them out when he had failed.</p><p>Keith soon peeked his head in. “Sir, they’re ready for the ceremony.”</p><p>Instead of being irritated at being interrupted during the process, he put everything down and moved to the common area, where the men were already lined up.</p><p>They had already seen Kyle hard at work, so the action of him immediately stopping just for them made them feel even more valued.</p><p>The ceremony was a simple oath to the gang, and Kyle personally fastened their armbands onto their sleeves. “You are now official members of the Seven Snakes and under my protection. I will fight through Hell and back to ensure your safety, and I only ask you to do the same for your comrades—and me.”</p><p>The men bowed with true respect. “Yes, sir!”</p><p><em>The loyalty will take a few days to truly instill</em>,<em> but it’s a start.</em></p><p>Keith showed them to their bunks while Kyle continued trying to figure out the recipe.</p><p>The process proved to be difficult. There were a huge number of potential combinations, and Kyle didn’t know when he would complete it—too many variables were present in the recipe. He now understood why Damian said reverse-engineering alchemy was nearly impossible without a hint or a guiding book. </p><p>As he completed his sixtieth failed potion, a new title appeared for him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Potion Crafter (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>This title was supposed to be given on successful potions, but the failures are pretty hard to watch. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> +10 INT, increased accuracy of examined potions’ descriptions, +10% chance to craft an intermediate potion when using basic materials. +5% chance of discovering basic potion recipes per attempt. This effect can be stacked and is reset on discovery.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it was as though three pieces of information appeared in his head, partially informing him of what the recipe consisted of. <em>It seems that for every twenty attempts I make, one of the variables of the recipe is revealed. Hence, with sixty crafted, I now have three variables revealed.</em> </p><p>Kyle quickly drew a new combination table, narrowing it down to two variables, making it simpler. With time and more failed attempts, he locked down yet another variable. Kyle could already imagine Haui’s face if he knew exactly how Kyle was able to reverse-engineer recipes so quickly. </p><p>A few hours passed through dinnertime before he finally got the recipe down. “So, 15% Greis Powder, 15% Olio Roots, 35% Yul’s Tears, rest water. Boiled for five minutes.” Kyle nearly raged at the sheer amount of Yul’s Tears he had wasted, having finished the entire pot with only one Strength Potion to show for it. <em>At least another product has been completed. Infusing it with Euria should be possible too.</em></p><p>He didn’t try to reverse-engineer the health potion just yet. It was far too costly to waste Yul’s Tears on it. If the percentage were even higher, he might go bankrupt.</p><p>He sat back in his office, eating a late dinner, while Keith reported the daily finances to him. </p><p>“Sir, you can’t keep burning through money like this. We don’t have a lot of cash reserves left. Assuming you want to make another set of Strength Potions, it’s going to wipe us out for the rest of the month unless we get steady revenue.”</p><p>“It’s no problem. The expansion of the brothel will be finished in a few days. We’ll easily make it back, then. Who are the other rival gangs that are at odds with the Red Lions?”</p><p>“The Ilysian Punks and the Wretches are the main ones that come to mind, but they’ve been ignoring us for a long time.”</p><p>“I want the smaller gangs in adjacent districts, anyone the same size as us and lower, to get this message.” Kyle packed a few parchments into message tubes, handing them over to Keith.</p><p>“Ah, you want to ask for their help! I’ll send it right away.”</p><p>“No, Keith. We’re going to find some customers.”<h1><a id="_n8sr2o86pitc"></a>Chapter 12: Arcite Technology</h1></p><p>Wrent fiddled with a Stamina Potion in his hand, sitting at the end of a long table in a well-furnished room. “Have any of the alchemists replied? I want to know if the potions they are providing are complete knockoffs. A twenty-man team should <em>not </em>be able to produce five hundred a day.” </p><p>It had been less than two days since they signed the contract, but Wrent had yet to distribute the Stamina Potions to his gang members for fear of them being poisoned. Such an outrageous production rate was banned by the Alchemists’ Guild—anyone flouting this rule was either an ostracized alchemist or someone trying to pull a quick one.</p><p>“Boss, our in-house alchemists are all currently busy and will respond in two weeks’ time.” The Red Lions’ main headquarters were still involved in violent conflict with the Ilysian Punks and the Wretches. Wrent had not yet been requested to join the conflict; his controlled district was not adjacent to any of the fighting zones. </p><p>“How about Haui? Has he replied?”</p><p>“We provided him with a few samples, and he has verified that they are legitimate, albeit with a lower efficiency than his. It could be said to be extremely diluted but still effective.”</p><p><em>So the Seven Snakes are mass-producing it but with a much lower quality than if done by a certified alchemist…</em> “If Haui says it’s okay, then we can use it. Our priority is to distribute them to our members first for enhanced training and preparation. We need everyone ready to assault the Seven Snakes at the end of the non-aggression pact.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>If everything goes to plan, the initial samples their alchemists have received won’t be the Euria-infused ones, seeing as the first three crates are completely clean. Suppose it’s Haui who is testing; that would be even better.</em> Kyle tapped the table, thinking. It’s been two days since the start of the contract.</p><p>An associate entered, passing Kyle a few replies from the other gangs. He opened them, reading the contents before calling Keith into the room.</p><p>“The new recruits won’t have time to prepare for the battle. The other gangs have agreed to purchase Strength Potions from us at a fixed rate for the next month. Get the new recruits to begin production on a separate line. Follow the exact method I did for the Stamina Potions, but no Euria this time.”</p><p>Kyle had sent a contract proposal, undercutting the market price of the Strength Potions with a discount of ten percent and selling them for nine hundred rakels each. <em>This shouldn’t rock the market too much. </em></p><p>“Sir, are we not planning to get the other gangs addicted?”</p><p>“Not yet. Let’s not burn any bridges this early and focus on earning money first. The faster we deliver the batch of Strength Potions, the more cash we will have on hand to supply our fighters and operations.”</p><p>Keith agreed and headed to the common area to set up the production lines, while Kyle considered his war plan. With the potions secured and a revenue source established, the supply contracts with the other gangs and the brothel’s imminent expansion would cause his current pile of cash to skyrocket. </p><p>Nevertheless, he had to consider the method by which he defeated the Red Lions. Showing off too much would prompt the top leader of the Red Lions to intervene and most likely crush them in one fell swoop.</p><p>He knew the Red Lions at large were engaged in an open conflict with the Ilysian Punks and Wretches, which gave him more wiggle room. However, they were not the only party involved; the local enforcers and maybe even the Ardent Cretins were watching him as well. Any actions taken would cause ripples, the consequences of which Kyle remained unsure due to his short time spent in the city.</p><p>Either way, he needed to ensure a clear combat advantage if he wanted to be able to control the flow of the fight. <em>Time to look for new advantages I can get.</em></p><p>Kyle had Damian bring him to the nearest arctech dealer he could find. The shop was situated in the corner of the food market, with multiple types of armor and household appliances on display, all of which were powered by various forms of arcia; this was where Keith bought the arcite stoves. </p><p>The dealer wore a simple cloak, the glint of steel armor shining underneath. His demeanor and countenance hinted at a military background; the man might have been a former shock trooper for the Count of Raktor. They briefly locked eyes, their intentions exchanged without words. </p><p><em>Let’s not pick a fight first.</em> Kyle focused on gathering information through the holographic interface. He picked up a few items, reading their descriptions intently.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Glacial Defensive Bracelet (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Slow those who would stop you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Sprint</strong>: Allows the wielder to move faster.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 2 MP. <strong>Duration</strong>: 15 seconds. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 60 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Chest Plate of Strength (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A generic plate engraved with a strengthening mechanism.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> +5 STR, +5 VIT. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Strength</strong>: Allows the wielder to increase strength for as long as arcia is provided. Warning — arcite fuel is suggested. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 10 MP.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle inspected the chest plate, noticing it was fairly intricate. Engravings similar to the metal pipe he had ran all over the surface and interior, along with what seemed like two electrical terminals meant to be connected to something else that powered the piece.</p><p>“Ah, you’ll need an arcite fuel pack for that.” The dealer pointed to a basic waist belt filled with canisters of a mild, cobalt-blue liquid that pulsated slowly. Kyle recognized it to be of the same arcite glow that currently powered his potion stoves, albeit more powerful and efficient. <em>Seems like there are different grades of arcite fuel—in solid or in liquid.</em></p><p>“How much for it?”</p><p>“Well, normal civilians aren’t supposed to have their own combat fuel packs without a license, but we both know we’re well beyond <em>normal</em>, don’t we? Sixty thousand.”</p><p>Kyle’s face didn’t show any reaction, but he internally winced at the price. As much as the brothel was currently making, it didn’t seem feasible to buy the fuel pack. Furthermore, being exposed for having a fuel pack while on a shaky gang foundation might incite the enforcers to act against him. <em>I’ve already spent enough bribing them.</em></p><p>The dealer noted Kyle’s reluctance. “You can run the other two items without arcite fuel, but that’s all dependent on how much… <em>natural energy</em> your body has.” </p><p><em>It seems like he’s referring to the MP stat I’ve been seeing. I have zero right now. How do I increase it?</em> Kyle nodded in response to the dealer before leaving. The prices of the other two items were also in the tens of thousands, representing a significant investment that he wanted to mull over first. </p><p>Kyle continued to browse the other items until he spotted something that took him by surprise. <em>Huh. Did not expect to find this here.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Enchanted Flintlock Pistol (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>An arcia-gorging device that shoots pellets at high speeds. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Buckshot</strong>: Accelerate muzzle-loaded pellets at high speeds, causing damage on impact. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 25 MP.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The dealer scoffed at the gun as Kyle examined it. “Bah! I’ve been trying to get rid of that pistol for ages now. Nobody around can even use it, and it cost me far too much to acquire in the first place.”</p><p>“Nobody uses guns around here?”</p><p>“There aren’t any laws against wielding pistols, only laws against using military guns. The Count has much better guns being used. But seeing as you’re too poor to buy a fuel pack, you might as well forget about <em>this</em>.” The dealer shooed him off.</p><p>Kyle mulled as he walked back to the base. “Damian, how much is the gun and who else uses them?”</p><p>“Within the city, only the top of the enforcers, sir. But even <em>they </em>don’t have the energy to arm themselves with pistols and use them; it simply draws too much arcia energy and takes time to reload. The design and manufacture of such arctech is still far too complicated for factories to produce. I’ve heard the military has made some headway in improving the guns, but for now, we’re stuck with this.”</p><p>Kyle noted the information Damian had given him. <em>So it’s essentially a flintlock pistol that uses arcia instead of gunpowder. </em>Naturally, with his knowledge from the Galactic Era, it would be a cinch to dominate the market with high technology and his rudimentary understanding. But until he figured out what the current military technology was, he wouldn’t attempt to manufacture any guns. Too big of a jump would open up a whole other can of worms, and he already had his hands full dealing with the Red Lions. <em>None of the technology here is combustion based, so showing up with gunpowder will draw too many eyes. Best not go that route.</em></p><p>Returning to the base, Kyle laid out the three arctech items he had personally appropriated from Riker and Lionel: the Breastplate of Nullification, Enchanted Flaming Hammer, and Enchanted Metal Pipe.</p><p>Each item required MP to activate their skills. He had witnessed Lionel activating the hammer and Wrent wearing an armor suit that clearly had arctech capabilities. <em>Even with the Strength Potion, I’m at a disadvantage. When fighting, I can’t use the system interface to determine their effects beforehand without touching them. </em></p><p>“Statistics.”</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">* * *</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle frowned, but all hope was not yet lost. Based on his understanding of how titles worked, he had a rough guess at an alternative way to proceed. <em>Best ask the locals.</em></p><p>“Are there any items that boost the… natural energy of someone?” Kyle asked Damian and Keith. </p><p>Damian’s mouth dropped while an excited expression came over Keith’s face. “By Yual, Alvin! You’re back!” Damian reached forward to hug Kyle in what was to be a touching reunion but instead found himself facing the ceiling of the office, his arm locked.</p><p>“I already told you to call me Kyle or sir.”</p><p>Damian and Keith’s enthusiasm dimmed, and Damian slowly stood up. They were a bit shaken and glanced at each other with a knowing expression. “Sir, Slavin at the brothel has a few types of… erm… artifacts of a certain nature that might boost your lifestyle,” Damian replied with a hint of understanding.</p><p>“I understand if you want to let off some steam before the big fight.” Keith nodded in agreement as though the two brothers were wise men instructing Kyle about his destiny, stroking a non-existent beard.</p><p>“What the hell are you two on about? I’m talking about using arctech.”</p><p>“Oh. Right. Sorry. It might be worth a shot to try to find Ulon’s private stash then. It’s where your current necklace came from.”</p><p>“Haven’t we already auctioned or trashed most of it?” Kyle recalled disliking the useless trinkets and ornaments, and when he touched them, an interface didn’t pop up.</p><p>“No, those are just the public ones. I don’t know too much about it, but I do know it’s somewhere in the room. Though it is just a rumor I heard from other gang members. It may not be true.”</p><p>The three of them scoured the private room where Kyle was sleeping, eventually finding a wooden box in a bookcase embedded into the wall.</p><p>Keith had stars in his eyes, no doubt waiting to see what valuable items there were. “This is exciting! Maybe we can pawn some of it.” He rubbed his hands together feverishly.</p><p>Damian noticed the box was neither secured nor locked. “He probably thought no one would steal anything.”</p><p>They opened it to reveal a massive pile of junk, all useless trinkets. Kyle methodically went through them one by one, irked at the moldy condition of many of the statues. Soon he held a statue of a penis with stains on it, slightly used. He quickly handed it over to Keith, who had long lost the stars in his eyes and nearly gagged when he held it.</p><p>After sorting through more than a hundred objects, Kyle soon found a sapphire ring with a golden band. It appeared to be engraved, but it had somehow worn away over time. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Magus Ring of Theorin (Intermediate)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A ring from a former wielder of arcia.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> +5 MAX MP, +25% MP recovery rate.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>That’s a tiny amount…</em> Kyle immediately put the ring on his right hand, and felt a surge of what the denizens of this world called arcia energy rush through his veins like a hit of an exotic stimulant. It was minuscule in effect, but he could already tell his body had improved. He his fingers, noticing the existence of something else coursing through his muscles, though he could not pinpoint exactly what it was, where it was, and how fast it was moving. <em>Interesting… I don’t recall any base humans having such a feature.</em> Kyle sorted through the rest of the stash, only finding one book of interest. It was an intricately bound tome, complete with a metal binder and leather covers filled with engravings. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>A Treatise on Arcia by Theorin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>An incomplete guide on wielding internal arcia</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The theories are outdated but still provide a good baseline understanding.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>“My God! I didn’t know this still existed!” Damian exclaimed as he wiped the dust off the old tome. “Theorin was the first gang leader of the Seven Snakes more than twenty years ago. He was a natural-born wielder of arcia, a mage if you will. This allowed him to dominate the districts before arcite fuel became popularized. Didn’t expect Ulon to have held on to it.”</p><p>Kyle opened the tome, noting the complexity of the words and some of the more complicated terminology and formulas that would take time for him to understand. He would need Keith’s assistance to translate it. </p><p>With this book and the new ring, he could potentially begin to utilize more arctech in the future. Even <em>he </em>understood the limitation of his fighting skills against items that could impart special effects. <em>With this, it’ll be an easy win. </em><h1><a id="_vc3rrmwfj7t3"></a>Chapter 13: Assault</h1></p><p><em>A few days later…</em></p><p>“Boss, all our men are waiting for your orders.”</p><p>“Good.” Wrent nodded his head, wearing his reddish armor set. He strode out to the training yard where more than forty members were all lined up in formation under the evening sky. They each had a light armor set, but only four of them had arctech on them, which was the sign of the squad leaders. Each squad had ten members standing in neat rows.</p><p>“The Seven Snakes have been rapidly growing over the last two weeks. On top of that, they are still holding our men! As such, from today, we will be entering a state of war against them. Each squad is to target one of the major businesses immediately.”</p><p>Wrent held up a printed piece of paper with a rough sketch of Kyle’s face. “If you encounter the leader of the Seven Snakes, Kyle, retreat at once. Do not attempt to engage alone. The objective is to wear them down and split their forces. He is the only one among them who has any sort of combat training. The rest are weak idiots.”</p><p>Wrent knew this war had a chance of being dragged out. If they failed the first assault, they had to wear them down slowly over time.</p><p>The Red Lions had been using the Stamina Potions, but not all of them. Wrent kept more than four hundred of them in a protected area near the armory. However, he wasn’t worried about an attack on the base, seeing as he was here to defend it. This allowed him to maximize his attacking force, which he needed if he wanted to hold a numerical advantage over the Seven Snakes.</p><p>He passed a single arctech radio to each of the squad leaders. This way, Wrent would be able to monitor the situation, and the squad leaders could convey information to one another. Information was the key to winning everything—Wrent knew that well.</p><p>“These are precious pieces of equipment loaned to us by the main base. Don’t you dare lose it! Even if you die, your ghost must return this to me. Understood?”</p><p>The squad leaders nodded grimly. </p><p>“A few days, a week, two weeks—we will not rest until the Seven Snakes have capitulated and returned our comrades. The Red Lions never falter in the face of adversity. BEGIN!”</p><p>“Yes, Boss!” The squads began to move out, heading to their designated locations.</p><p>Wrent smiled to himself as he retreated into his office. <em>You may be smart, but the nail that sticks out will get hammered down first. It’s just business.</em> He was already internally salivating at the thought of taking over their potion production process, wondering what other secrets the Seven Snakes held on to.</p><p>An hour passed, approaching dusk. The arctech streetlights began to flicker on, their bright, blue lights illuminating the dusty cobblestone roads. The first squad reached the brothel first, but they soon noticed that the Seven Snakes associates were already out in force, with seven guys guarding the nearby streets.</p><p><em>“Boss, they seemed to be onto us,”</em> a squad leader reported through the radio.</p><p><em>“It’s expected.”</em> Wrent was calm, already having expected Kyle to be prepared in advance. <em>“When all squads are in position, we’ll attack simultaneously.”</em></p><p>Another ten minutes passed before all four squads were in position. The brothel, two pubs, and a restaurant were being targeted, but the squads reported seeing associates of the Seven Snakes in the vicinity.</p><p>“Any sign of Kyle?”</p><p><em>“No, Boss. But there seems to be more associates than the twenty expected. Closer to thirty or even more now.”</em></p><p>This didn’t faze Wrent at all<em>. If I’m right, he’s probably waiting at the base or somewhere in the middle where he can rapidly respond to any attacks. And the new recruits barely had a week or two for training.</em> “Move in now.”</p><p>The squads slowly began moving into the district, positioning aggressively and standing near the targeted businesses. The customers who were initially beginning to queue up began to scatter upon seeing the threatening Red Lions members stare at them from a distance. Word began to spread around like wildfire—it was a turf war.</p><p>One of the Seven Snakes’ guards began to confront them. “Hey! What are you red cunts trying here? You’re fucking scaring them off!”</p><p>“I’ll stand wherever the fuck I like. Why? Does your father own these streets? Didn’t know this was your grandfather’s road either. Mind your own business.”</p><p>“You better fucking move, or—”</p><p>“Or what? Run and hide, like you always did with Ulon? Once a bitch, always a bitch.”</p><p>All over the district, confrontations like this were beginning to drive the tension even higher. The Red Lions were provoking the Seven Snakes to attack first. It was all a childish back-and-forth of who attacked first and who was in the right, a game of public perception as a few brave onlookers watched the arguments grow more heated.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, it wouldn’t matter who started the fight or waved the biggest stick—only who won. Wrent was about to lean back into his comfortable office chair, waiting for the inevitable victory, when he suddenly heard a loud thud in the training yard before a metal door cracked open with a repeated hammering sound.</p><p>The grating metallic sounds pierced the air, prompting Wrent to immediately exit the office to see who was attacking. A lone man was smacking away at the hinges of the armory door with a neon-red arctech hammer, and they soon gave way, sending the door to the ground with a large cloud of dust.</p><p>“KYYYYYLLE!” Wrent lunged at him, retrieving his ruby-encrusted sword from its sheath and swinging wildly. However, the arctech shoes Kyle wore glowed yellow and allowed him to move a bit faster than expected, barely dodging the ferocious attacks. Kyle quickly ran into the armory, glancing around at the numerous racks of weapons and armor before spotting the potion crates.</p><p>A tingling sensation ran down his spine as he instinctively ducked, a red energy arc slicing through the air where his head had just been. The arc crashed into the potion crates with a loud explosion, sending dark-yellow liquid spiraling into the air.</p><p><em>That’s new.</em></p><p>Kyle glanced behind Wrent to see a pipe connected to a churning fuel pack at his waist and a sword glowing with arcia. “So, you’ve come to your death, then. Were you planning on raiding the armory to steal our equipment?” Wrent grinned, blocking the only exit.</p><p>Without a word, Kyle ran deeper inside, much to the surprise of Wrent.</p><p>“COME BACK HERE, YOU CUNT!” Wrent yelled as he charged through the armory. Kyle quickly used his hammer to smack the intersections of a few empty armor racks and tossed training weapons to stall Wrent. The well-organized armory started collapsing, the metal shelves and cupboards being overturned.</p><p>Wrent’s armor prevented him from moving as fast as Kyle, rendering him unable to keep up. Kyle leapt over him with one swift motion, landing in a roll. As soon as he recovered, he ran straight out the door. </p><p>“STOP RIGHT THERE!” Wrent yelled.</p><p>Kyle didn’t comply, only showing a small smirk before leaving, which infuriated Wrent even more. Wrent glanced around the room, seeing only an utter mess. No critical equipment was being kept here; all of it had already been distributed to the attacking squads. He tried to figure out Kyle’s objective, since the man was clearly avoiding a fight with him.</p><p>The dark-yellow liquid oozing onto the floor suddenly made him realize he had lost the entire stash of potions. The loss of the Stamina Potions weighed on him, but his pride mattered more. How could he have failed to capture the enemies’ leader when he was right there? He ran back to the office and grabbed the radio.</p><p>“Cease the attack and converge back on the base—Kyle is fleeing back through our district! Cut him off!”</p><p><em>“Boss, we can’t. We’re right in front of them. If we back off now, our reputation will take a hit!”</em></p><p>“Aren’t they pushovers? Just attack first, knock out a few of them, and then catch the leader!”</p><p>The Red Lions squads were now torn between leaving a confrontation they started and capturing Kyle. “Fuck it. If Wrent ordered it, we’ll do it!”</p><p>They quickly began to attack, but none of the Seven Snakes members were surprised, knowing their plan had succeeded. “Hold as many of them here! Don’t let them cut off our leader!”</p><p>Battles erupted in the street, the flickering of the arctech neon signs serving as the backdrop to dozens of men that fought in the streets in a rough melee brawl with fists, gauntlets, knuckle dusters, and pipes. Blood and the twisting of limbs became a common scene all over the cobblestone ground, with fighters wrestling and ganging up on single targets. Everything was fair game.</p><p>Much to the surprise of the Red Lions, the Seven Snakes were suddenly much better at fighting. They were able to dodge and parry effectively, to a certain extent. It was not only the effect of the homemade Strength Potions that boosted them. They had undergone training since Kyle had taken over, which was now close to a month for the original members, much like a boot camp.</p><p>Any of the Red Lions members who tried to carry out Wrent’s order were instantly intercepted by the Seven Snakes. However, the Red Lions still had the edge in arctech equipment and experience, allowing them to inflict more damage as the battle continued. The fights were brutal, with both sides suffering injuries and broken limbs.</p><p><em>“Boss, they aren’t that weak; we can’t beat them instantly like we expected!”</em></p><p>Wrent cursed and pounded his fist on his office table, cracking it in half. “ARRRGH! SEVEN SNAKES!” He couldn’t leave the base lest Kyle was performing a feint—there were still plenty of high-value resources that Kyle could quickly return to ransack.</p><p>The scale of the fights began to escalate, with exhaustion setting in. But the Seven Snakes were far more tenacious, gritting their teeth as they pushed back against the numerical and equipment disadvantages. “This is nothing compared to our training!”</p><p>The next hour was harrowing as the fights dragged on. Wrent impatiently tapped the table, waiting for some good news over the arctech radio. All of a sudden, one of the lights indicating an active connection to a squad dimmed. <em>Shit… One of the squads had their arctech radio broken?! It has to be Kyle!</em></p><p>With a squad out of contact, it meant that the net he had set up around the Seven Snakes’ district had fallen apart. Wrent’s brow furrowed intensely as he contemplated whether or not he should enter the battle himself to counter Kyle’s combat ability. However, he instinctively knew that he was now one step behind; entering the battle would be playing right into the enemies’ hand. </p><p>“All squads, retreat now!” Wrent ordered, aiming to conserve his forces. <em>I must cut my losses and reorganize before it’s too late!</em></p><p>The Red Lions were more than happy to comply, immediately retreating and limping away.</p><p>The Seven Snakes did not chase them, instead letting them retreat slowly. They themselves did not go unscathed, having suffered a few injuries and concussions far worse than the Red Lions. The potions helped them with the grit to stay standing after the brutal clash.</p><p><em>Should I call for reinforcements from the main base?</em> The brief thought flashed through Wrent’s mind when he realized he was now on an even playing field with the Seven Snakes, and may have even lost. Even if half of them returned, he had no Stamina Potions left to give them.</p><p>He shuddered when he thought of how the boss of the Red Lions would react if he asked for help. The main base had problems of their own when fighting other gangs, and if Wrent admitted he couldn’t handle a small-time group like the Seven Snakes, he could forget about climbing the ranks. <em>My position as the Left Paw would be stripped regardless of victory. I’ll have to do this myself.</em></p><p>Eventually, the squads returned, including the one that had lost the radio. They had to leave three of their members behind while the other squads returned intact but still wounded.</p><p>“W-What happened to our potions?!” a returning squad member exclaimed upon seeing the mess of broken crates and liquid on the floor.</p><p>Wrent didn’t respond, inwardly cursing himself for not protecting it to the best of his ability. He took out a secret stash of Health Potions, distributing them to the squad leaders.</p><p>“One squad will keep guard and patrol the district lest the Seven Snakes try to attack while we’re weak. Rotate every eight hours. All other squads are to sleep.” Wrent knew they needed to rest if he wanted to have a shot at winning at all.</p><p>With the assault failing, they had now entered a protracted conflict stage.<h1><a id="_wk2hzybq4s1p"></a>Chapter 14: Horizontal Merger</h1></p><p>“Sir, how did you know they weren’t going to call in reinforcements? It seems stupid not to do so, seeing as they lost half a squad.” Damian was confused as he oversaw the associates dragging captured Red Lions members to their holding cells.</p><p>“Wrent is a showman through and through. Any action that could potentially damage his reputation wouldn’t be taken. Even then, us providing Strength Potions to many of the other smaller gangs around them has increased the number of issues their main base has to deal with, which means they can spare even fewer men to counter us,” Kyle explained. </p><p>“Then why didn’t we chase them down and defeat them in one single blow? Now they’ll have time to recover and retaliate in a few days.”</p><p>“A cornered star fleet is just as dangerous as a wounded one.”</p><p>“Fleet? As in naval battles?”</p><p>“Never mind. Either way, pushing them too hard would attract more attention from the major bases. The victory over them must be complete but not too flashy.” </p><p>Damian finally understood Kyle’s line of thinking. It wasn’t right to go all out and stomp the opposition in a domineering fashion, especially when the foundations of the gang weren’t solid enough. There were too many big fish in the district watching right now. Having the Seven Snakes come to a draw or a very minor victory was less alarming. </p><p>The two of them began checking on the injured members, with Kyle healing them with his Necklace of Healing. The Red Lions were still dominant when it came to weaponry, causing some of the Seven Snakes members to fall unconscious after fighting enemy squad leaders fitted with arctech equipment. A few even had mangled or severely bruised limbs. <em>I should reverse-engineer a Health Potion after this.</em></p><p>He soon returned to his office, tired from the intense running he had had to do. The plan had been executed perfectly, though he might have been slightly forced to buy the Aero Shoes from the dealer to move faster. With this, the chances of the Red Lions attacking them would be much lower than expected; they were now even in numbers.</p><p>Kyle was well aware that the Red Lions still had the edge in terms of equipment, as evidenced by the damage inflicted on his gang members. Nevertheless, he wasn’t worried at all. <em>In a few days, they will crumble, and it‘ll be an easy negotiation…</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>Five days after the assault…</em></p><p>Wrent woke up groggy, his forehead sweating buckets as he struggled to get up from his bed. <em>Fuck. Have I been infected with a plague or something?</em> He could feel his heart rate increasing, and there was a general sinking feeling in his stomach. </p><p>The nerves on his jaw and spine were especially tender, as though he could feel every millimeter of his gums going numb, causing him to try to dislodge the feeling constantly. </p><p>The other Red Lions members were not faring any better either; some were puking or reporting intense nausea. “What in the world is going on?” Wrent muttered as he watched the members stumble about, lacking strength. “Hey, you. Weren’t you supposed to be on patrol? What if the Seven Snakes attack?”</p><p>“H-Huh?” The Red Lions member could barely register what Wrent was saying, obviously hallucinating.</p><p><em>Fucking shit. What is happening?!</em> Wrent tried to recall what had happened. <em>Did Kyle somehow infect the base’s utilities? How is this happening to us?</em></p><p>Wrent had been taking antidotes for the last two days, which had barely managed to stave off the symptoms. He had even tried a precious Health Potion, but it didn’t work at all. <em>It isn’t poison… So what is it?</em></p><p>His eyes landed on the broken crates of Stamina Potions, a sense of understanding finally hitting him. <em>Did they drug the potions? How in the world is it so addictive?! But I tested it!</em></p><p>Addiction was not a particularly new symptom, but he had not seen anything on the black market that came even remotely close to the level of addiction and mass production as this.</p><p>The strategy employed by the Seven Snakes was finally as clear as day. Before Wrent could think about doing anything, a loud bang at the base entrance was heard.</p><p>It was the Seven Snakes.</p><p>Kyle walked in, dressed in a clean, formal suit, unlike the arctech equipment he had worn previously. Damian and Keith flanked him, along with a dozen other members.</p><p>“You dare come to your own death? Red Lions, attack him!” Wrent grunted weakly. Instead of complying, the members merely staggered about, and some others suffered from mild seizures.</p><p>Kyle snapped his fingers, with the Seven Snakes moving forward to restrain the barely  resisting Red Lions. The most they could muster was an infantile resistance.</p><p>“Useless!” Wrent grunted as he grabbed his sword with his right hand, about to unleash another red arc with a swing. But in a single instant, Kyle sprinted toward him with the Aero Shoes, closing the distance in merely four strides before gripping the right hand of Wrent and forcing it down. </p><p>“ARGHH!” Wrent yelled in pain as Kyle crushed his right hand with the hilt of the sword. He tried to muster the strength to fight back, but the withdrawal symptoms made it impossible. Wrent could feel that his muscles were severely weakened.</p><p>“This is no way to treat your esteemed suppliers, is it?” Kyle flashed a sinister grin.</p><p>At this point, Wrent heavily regretted not asking for help from the main base, realizing he had fully underestimated Kyle. He had become too used to the image of the Seven Snakes being useless under Ulon.</p><p>“Do it then. Kill me,” Wrent said through gritted teeth as he was brought to one knee, forced to look up at Kyle. “The leader of the Red Lions will never let you off.”</p><p>“Ah. Why would I ever kill my precious customers? Please, no need for such courtesy. You can stop kneeling.” Kyle let go of his hand, and Damian moved forward to lift Wrent up. </p><p>They dragged him into the office, sitting him down at a table facing. Kyle retrieved a parchment from a message tube and slid it in front of Wrent for him to read. “I believe the samples we provided in the previous contract were much to your liking. In fact, it seems your members love it so much they’re even dying for it.”</p><p>“Y-You!” Wrent cursed as sweat dripped down his forehead. He could barely move his body now, and the bones in his right hand had been fractured by Kyle’s grip. </p><p>“Now for our next contract, we would like to enter a mutually beneficial supply contract. If you sign this, we will immediately provide a few crates in advance for your perusal.  How does that sound?” Kyle motioned outside the office window, where Wrent could see two additional Seven Snakes members carrying crates.</p><p>He could already see the hunger in his members’ eyes as they watched the crates come in. They weren’t dumb, knowing they were addicted to the potions now, but they didn’t have the willpower to fight their bodies. </p><p>Wrent took another look at Kyle, who was patiently sitting with Damian and Keith standing behind him. While Kyle’s expression was calm and serene, Wrent knew there was a cruelness hiding within. <em>What’s more important—my loyalty to the boss or my life?</em> </p><p>He glanced at his members suffering outside. Wrent grimaced and finally decided to look at the contract, rationalizing to himself that he was doing it for his subordinates. He began reading through it, noticing the clauses were roughly the same except for the fact that he now had to pay for the potions.</p><p>He read the changes to the non-aggression clause, noticing the contract had extended it to a year minimum. This was expected, but the next clause was what threw him off.</p><p>It stated that the Seven Snakes would <em>publicly</em><strong><em> </em></strong>admit that the conflict had been their fault and their loss. They would then pay reparations in the form of potion discounts and the release of prisoners.</p><p>Wrent was utterly confused, but as he looked up into Kyle’s eyes, a realization rose within him. <em>He’s leaving me a way out—a way not to be replaced by my boss. And if I or our side in general renege on the reparation contract, our reputation will go straight into the gutter. </em></p><p>With this additional clause, the Red Lions would not suffer any reputation loss, and the Seven Snakes would also have their non-aggression pact. Wrent would have a much higher chance of retaining his position and control over the district, which was precisely what Kyle wanted. In his mind, Wrent vowed to kill Kyle in any way possible. <em>This man is far too dangerous. At this rate, he’ll take over the entire sector within two years.</em></p><p>Wrent eventually relented and signed the contract with his personal stamp. “Good. I’m glad we’ve come to an agreement. Enjoy the potions. We look forward to your future cooperation.” Kyle smirked and left immediately. While the contract was between equals, Wrent knew he had become the underling in the unspoken hierarchy, gripping his fist tightly.</p><p>As the Seven Snakes released the restrained members and left the new crates behind, the members were confused about what had just happened. Some of the members were certain they were going to be killed.</p><p>Wrent didn’t know what to tell them. All they could do now was consume the potions. <em>I swear I’ll find a way to remove this addiction and take revenge!</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>Always leave a way out for a cornered corvette, lest they choose to self-destruct. It is better to milk your enemies. </em>Kyle was happy with the result. While he would be losing the prisoners, he had run sufficient tests on the addiction properties by now. With the gang members being trained for over a month, there was no need for addiction-ridden prisoners to fight against. They could simply spar against one another.</p><p><em>This will also prevent the more significant gangs from clamping down on us. Anyone else that tries to attack us will risk angering the Red Lions, seeing as we are supplying them in a reparation contract…</em></p><p>None of the Seven Snakes were unhappy with the outcome, even though it was to be publicly declared; they all knew they had emerged as victors of the conflict. It boosted their pride and sense of accomplishment, but most of all, it caused their respect for Kyle to soar far into the clouds. All the members were comparing him to Ulon, though it was a low bar to clear. Even the new recruits who hadn’t fought as much were starstruck by how easily they defeated the Red Lions.</p><p>“Holy shit! It was only a few hours of skirmishes, four days of patrols, and that’s it? Is our leader some sort of monster?”</p><p>“He managed to sneak into their base alone and escape even with Wrent defending! How awesome is that? Fuck the guy who told me Wrent was a beast!” Niko excitedly whispered as they watched Kyle return to the base with the rest.</p><p>Kyle began giving out orders. “Keith, prepare the public announcement. Spread it through our businesses. Get Slavin in on it as well.” The brothel expansion was going well despite the conflict, with the customers reasonably assured of the protection provided by the Seven Snakes. </p><p>“Damian, arrange for the prisoner transfer process. Return everyone, addicted or not.”</p><p>“Everyone else, gather in the common area in three hours for dinner. It’s time to celebrate.” A loud cheer erupted among the associates. They were excited to celebrate their first victory in over five years.</p><p>Kyle returned to his office, looking at the map that showed the districts again. </p><p><em>The base is now secured against most smaller threats. The locals are now well aware of the resurgence of the Seven Snakes.</em> Kyle nodded to himself, but he knew he was far from being a significant power in the city of Raktor. If he truly wanted to achieve his first original objective of building a solid power base, only when he had dominated an entire city would he consider it as some measure of success. </p><p>His eyes fell on the list of gangs in the South Sector, noting the prominent individuals and the top dominator—the Ardent Cretins. Despite the daunting challenges ahead, Kyle already had a step-by-step plan for what to do.</p><p><em>I used to rule nebulas, spice routes, and star systems with populations numbering in the trillions. What’s a small city like this to me?</em><h1><a id="_z5a0ukowb6wa"></a>Chapter 15: Repercussions</h1></p><p><em>The next day…</em></p><p>“Did you hear? The Seven Snakes lost to the Red Lions and have to pay reparations.”</p><p>“Nah, no way. I saw them fight each other—they were at a draw! Sure, the Seven Snakes were nearly beaten shitless, but they were extremely tenacious.”</p><p>“Their new leader seems to be much more competent than Ulon, but I guess a small-time gang will always be small-time.”</p><p>Such were the types of rumors going around the food market and the South Sector, but they were drowned out in a sea of other conflicts. The Seven Snakes were not the only gang fighting at the time—it was the city of Raktor, so a fight was around every corner.</p><p>“Are we going to be the next dominator of the South Sector?” one of the more overtly excited gang members asked.</p><p>“Idiot, no way! How the hell are we going to overtake the Ardent Cretins? Wait, fuck that. We can’t even go against the main force of the Red Lions!”</p><p>“Nah, believe in Kyle! I like him much better than his Alvin persona.”</p><p>“Can’t wait to have my own underlings; I’ll put them through the same training routine!”</p><p>The mood in the base was festive, but Kyle was not. At least not until the waves had died down. He sat in his office, waiting patiently until Keith came in, his face clearly shaken. </p><p>“Sir, there’s someone here to see you.”</p><p>“Is it the enforcers? I’ve been expecting them.” Kyle had anticipated a potential visit, seeing as they had now established their foundation in the district. He was not averse to collaborating with the enforcers—crime and law went hand in hand. Already in his mind, he was coming up with ways to entice and lure the enforcers into his pocket. <em>Perhaps a tax-generating scheme or even mutual assistance in reducing crime. </em></p><p>He could even use the enforcers to potentially suppress some of the thug groups lurking around the district. Despite the Seven Snakes’ resurgence, it was foolish to assume that they had complete control over every individual in the area—countless upstarts and small three-man gangs ran multiple smuggling rings and production lines as well.</p><p>But Keith shook his head violently. “N-N-No, sir. It-It’s n-not the enforcers.” Keith barely stuttered the words out, his hands trembling and with fear. </p><p>“Is he alone?” Kyle squinted his eyes, tossing out his current thoughts.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Kyle’s expression darkened. “Have him come in. Prepare the best tea we have.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Soon, a well-dressed gentleman in a butler outfit walked in, his hair slicked back in jet-black lines, and his face immaculate. The suit spoke volumes of care and attention to detail—the thread count was specifically selected and the gradient of the fabric was astounding. He did not bow nor show any signs of respect toward Kyle, treating him like a decoration while he simply walked around the office and looked at the bookshelves and furniture. “How quaint. I am a bit sad to see Ulon’s hallmark ornaments missing.”</p><p>“They were quite a distraction, so I had them auctioned off.”</p><p>“A pity. I would have hoped he kept some of my older gifts.” The man finally locked eyes with Kyle before sitting in a chair meant for guests, relaxing as though he had just arrived home.</p><p>“I’m sure he appreciated the gifts nonetheless.”</p><p>“Oh, my gifts pale in comparison to the gift you gave him.” The man chuckled at his own joke. Keith soon entered the room with a teapot and cup on a delicate tray, placing it down and pouring a cup for the guest. However, his hands were shaking terribly, the tea violently vibrating as the glass clinked.</p><p>The man simply smiled at Keith and turned back to Kyle. “You’re doing much better than Ulon did. When I first met him, he could barely reply to me or look me in the eye. I recall him trembling continuously, unable to form a coherent sentence. Much like this poor young boy.” He motioned his hand to Keith, who quickly bowed and took a step back.</p><p>“I would not use Ulon as a measure for eloquence—or a measure for anything.”</p><p>“Indeed. Ulon was never able to make use of what he had on hand.” The man chuckled, closely examining Keith and sizing him up. “A gait of a scholar. Sharp eyes, though bravery has to be worked on a tad more. Your abilities seemed to be far wasted here. Perhaps I can offer you another form of employ—”</p><p>“Get to the point,” Kyle interjected in defiance. The man did not seem irked in the slightest, giving a mere gentle smile as he crossed his legs.</p><p>“I’m here to deliver a form of greeting from our leader, Ares UIras. He has only the best wishes for the future of the Seven Snakes and hopes to potentially forge relationships where possible. We are open to partnerships or collaborations in any future ventures.”</p><p>Kyle nodded. “You may give him my thanks, Sebastian. I will surely take him up on his offer in the near future.”</p><p>“Ah, a man who has done his research. Consider me surprised that even an amnesiac knows about me.”</p><p>“It’s hard not to know legends and myths about the vice-leader of the Ardent Cretins.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t flatter me. I’m simply doing my job. I’m sure that you will have your own myths in the future—if given enough time.”</p><p>“Only if I am allowed to.”</p><p>Sebastian’s smile grew. “I knew we would understand each other. A big improvement over Ulon, as repugnant of a standard he might be. It seems like being an amnesiac is a gift of sorts; perhaps I should try it one day.”</p><p>“I can have an alchemist prepare a memory-erasing potion if you so wish. Perhaps we could set an appointment?”</p><p>Sebastian laughed, while Kyle maintained a stoic expression. “Maybe when I’m retired. For now, I still have to manage a group of naughty children who only get rowdier as they age. Always aiming to become the parent, thinking they have what it takes to rule the world. Do you have any tips for handling them?”</p><p>“Some sweets or cake would make them easy to handle. A gift or a concession goes a long way to fostering trust.”</p><p>“Ah, but children are quick to forget, especially when another carrot is dangled in front of them. That reminds me.” He stood up, rummaging through his inner pocket.</p><p>“A token of goodwill from the Ardent Cretins.” Sebastian retrieved a transparent glass bottle holding a miniature galleon suspended by wood inside. “An exquisite gift, handcrafted by one of our patrons.”</p><p>He stood up and placed it on the table in front of Kyle. The boat was extremely intricate and fragile. Keith looked at it and could tell that even a slight, sudden jerk could cause the boat to collapse. For Sebastian to be able to carry it in his suit without breaking it was stupendous.</p><p>“Do be careful with it. It is extremely delicate. If one were to rock the boat too much, the pieces within would begin to crumble. Hopefully it will still be intact the next time we meet. ” Sebastian took his leave, with Keith escorting him out of the base.</p><p>When Keith returned, his leader was still staring at the ship.</p><p>“Wow, I didn’t know the vice leader of the Ardent Cretins was so nice! That boat looks really expensive!” Keith exclaimed. </p><p>“It was not a nice conversation, far from it. It was a threat,” Kyle responded grimly. After all that he had done to make sure he remained off the radar, the big fish of the South Sector had still locked on to him. He expected someone of note from the Ardent Cretins to visit eventually, but he never expected the vice leader to come in person. </p><p><em>Don’t rock the South Sector, lest you want your gang to crumble into pieces.</em> Kyle knew what the warning was, clear as day. He clenched his fists tightly. </p><p>With the Ardent Cretins having their eye on him now, any sort of aggressive expansion or scaling up would be heavily scrutinized. The moment Sebastian detected a threat, Kyle knew he was the type to use everything he had to eliminate it immediately. That was the privilege of the strong, after all. Kyle himself used to do that in his former life. </p><p>“Keith, call Damian in. We will have to restructure the plan moving forward.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The Central Sector of the city was the most prosperous. Buildings made of arcia-infused glass towered over streets filled with automatic carriages, guided by the roads as they ferried aristocrats, nobles, and the general upper class to and fro. </p><p>An opulent and intricately detailed building reminiscent of a temple was one of the key features of the sector. While many of the locals and tourists would admire it as a work of art, it was equally feared by many of the gang leaders. </p><p>A lone girl walked up the marble steps, clearly excited as her cobalt-blue eyes darted around. She checked her pearl-white cloak, rubbing a small stain off the shiny, silver pauldrons. The golden hems of the cloak fluttered as she continued climbing, her straight dress pants and a buttoned shirt peeking from underneath. </p><p>“Inquisitor Kitana, here under orders from the archbishop.” She bowed to the guards at the entrance, who respectfully bowed back. They performed a simple check on her belongings before allowing her in.</p><p>She entered the vast temple, the ceiling and pillars adorned with paintings that had been completed over generations. At the height of it, all in prime view, was a portrait of Yual, the Emperor of the Yual Dominion that ruled over the city of Raktor and others.</p><p>As she walked, she could hear whispers from enforcers and clerks who stared at her, their echoes bouncing off the concave ceiling and domes. </p><p>“The inquisitors are here? Finally, we get some much-needed help.”</p><p>“Yes, the bloodbath in the West Sector between the Veiled Angels and the Violet Devils is escalating far beyond our control. If the inquisitors didn’t show up, we might have had to call in the military.”</p><p>“The military would never agree to intervene in civil affairs unless ordered by either the duke or the emperor himself.”</p><p>A servant led her to a smaller audience chamber, where an old priest was kneeling in front of a statue of the emperor. There were already nine others like her standing behind rows of pews and praying. Kitana quickly took an empty spot, clasping her hands in prayer as well. </p><p>After five minutes, the priest finally stood up, turning to face them. “My fellow priests and priestesses. It is with great honor that you have come before me and the emperor today to be given a special role.</p><p>“Crime has infiltrated the streets of Raktor, defiling the empire-wide bans set forth by the archbishop himself. Alcoholism, prostitution, senseless violence, and the proliferation of weapons are just some of the infestations that choke Raktors by the gut. The citizens of this city do not know what true purity is and are unwilling to adhere to the law. While the archbishop has turned a blind eye to it in the past, he can no longer divert his eyes from the stray sheep that are running amok.</p><p>“You shall act as the eyes and ears of the Sanctum of Yual. You are the arbiter, the judge, and the executioner of our will and our beliefs. Those who claim to be citizens of the Yual Dominion but do not uphold the same values must be taught otherwise, by words or by fear of death. For it is only through fear that they may learn to love the encompassing embrace that is our emperor.”</p><p>The priest retrieved a scroll, unrolled it, and read it. “As such, under holy appointment and orders direct from the archbishop himself, you are all now appointed as inquisitors of the Yual Reign. Go forth and cleanse this city of filth and bring glory to the emperor!”</p><p>“Glory to the emperor! Glory to Yual!” The ten inquisitors bowed.</p><p>They remained bowed as a few servants brought out a series of peaked caps, with the priest bestowing each individual with one, the symbol of the inquisitors clearly visible. The inquisitors solemnly received it, with one even bearing a grim expression as though he were about to be sent to the gallows.</p><p>Contrary to the others, Kitana received the cap excitedly, a fire lighting up in her eyes as she bowed in respect. The old priest chuckled before placing his hand on Kitana’s shoulder. “Keep that enthusiasm strong and steadfast. You’ll need it to face down the evil lurking in the city.”</p><p>“Yes, Bishop.” Kitana bowed even lower.</p><p>Soon, the ceremony was over, and Kitana was already ordered to head toward another room to meet the department that she would be in charge of. Each pair of inquisitors was to oversee the assistance of a different sector so as not to clash with each other. They were not working alone—they would be reporting to the overseeing bishops of each sector and working with local enforcers. </p><p>The inquisitors talked amongst themselves as they walked. “I sure hope I get assigned to the Central Sector. If I get sent to the West, I’ll die.”</p><p>“Why did the Sanctum even assign me here? This has got to be the worst place to be stationed right after graduation!”</p><p>While the inquisitors lamented the results, they barely noticed Kitana’s absence. Instead of following them, she had headed to a secluded area, grinning as she placed the cap snuggly on her head. She then glanced around, making sure no one was near. As she hunkered down, she whispered to herself, “Statistics.”<h1><a id="_3dx14b0c683"></a>Chapter 16: Corruption</h1></p><p>The arctech enforcer wagon rumbled as it crossed rugged and poorly maintained cobblestone streets, a far cry from the pristine capital of the Yual Dominion where Kitana had lived during her training. Her inquisitor partner found amusement in her uneasiness as he puffed a Euria pipe. </p><p>The blue smoke drifted across his gray beard, with each breath relaxing his tired wrinkles that seemed to mark every inch of his face. </p><p>“First time out of Tryas?” the old inquisitor joked as he stuffed more Euria Seed Powder into his pipe. </p><p>“I’m afraid so,” Kitana grumbled in reply, glancing through the back of the covered wagon. A grimy street trailed behind, with squatters half-drunk on the side of the road. </p><p>The pavement was half-covered in piss, vomit, or some other liquid. Gangs of young teenagers roamed the streets, harassing others, while dejected factory workers languished in piles of trash, blacked out from overdoses of various black market concoctions. </p><p>It was vastly different from the prim and proper feeling of the Central Sector. Here in the south, the fumes of the factories ballooned high above, while the dense streets were full of travelers, traders, mercenaries, and exiles from not just the Yual Dominion but other nations past the border as well. It was a pure melting pot of cultures, people, and the lowest of scum.</p><p>“Statistics,” Kitana muttered to herself, her eyes darting around at seemingly nothing. <em>So, I’m still level 1. I guess Mother was right about having to kill people to level up.</em> She peeked back at the streets and suppressed a smirk. She could see plenty of targets just asking to be <em>accidentally </em>killed. </p><p>She caught her partner staring at her, and she calmed herself down. <em>Better to play a zealous, naïve girl for now to stave off any suspicion. The more naïve I make myself, the better.</em></p><p>Just as the wagon passed yet another thug fight, Kitana stood up to stop the driver. The old inquisitor stood up to stop her, sitting her back down with a stern look. “Calm down, girl. Do you think you can take on all ten of them? Wait till we get to the office.”</p><p>Visibly fuming, she sat back down on her seat, glaring at her partner. His face showed no signs of anger or righteous fury. “What kind of inquisitor ignores crimes occurring against the Sanctum of Yual in front of their very eyes?” Kitana kept up the act.</p><p>“The practical kind.” He sighed. “I’ve seen plenty of people like you get killed instantly because they had no tact. Want to survive long enough to make a difference? Play it cool.”</p><p>“How the hell did you become an inquisitor?”</p><p>“Because I do my job. No more, no less.”</p><p>“Isn’t your job to punish crimes?” </p><p>“Oh, dear. This is what they get when they send such a fresh girl straight from Tryas. Listen, stay behind me and let me do most of the talking when we’re at the office, all right?” The old man continued to puff his smoke.</p><p>Kitana internally celebrated. <em>Good. Saves me the scrutiny.</em></p><p>The wagon soon stopped in front of a chapel.</p><p>“We’re here, esteemed inquisitors. Welcome to the Magda.”</p><p>The Magda was the South Sector’s enforcer headquarters—a block of buildings centered around the main chapel, providing the logistics and support necessary to each of its branches situated in each district. Thousands of cases and reports were handled here, as well as equipment procurement. </p><p>Kitana and her partner hopped out the back of the wagon, following their driver. They were led not into the chapel but into a side office building. Floors upon floors of administrative clerks handled requests for arcite ore or fuel, wagon repairs, and arctech equipment. Arctech phone lines rang non-stop at the station while stressed interns ran about with stacks of paper. The printing press shuddered violently, copies of case evidence and documentation churning out in a never-ending stream.</p><p>The two inquisitors walking through the office drew many eyes and whispers from the other enforcers, their white uniforms and decorative lapels sticking out like a sore thumb. Everyone they passed bowed to them, with the male inquisitor simply smiling and waving them off. </p><p>Soon they reached their destination—the bishop’s office. </p><p>It was a grand room with a ceiling two stories high. Bookshelves lined the walls as the light from the sunset shone through the stained glass windows, filled with depictions from the Sanctum of Yual.</p><p>“Ah, Mason. Thank Yual that they posted you here instead of that oaf Fredrinn.” The bishop smiled as she got out of her chair. Kitana noted her scarred hands as they approached the table, which was filled with piles of papers requesting her approval. </p><p>Mason chuckled as he came to a stop in front of the table, giving a half-hearted mock salute. “Inquisitor Mason and Inquisitor Kitana, at your service, Bishop Vernette.”</p><p>“This young? Are they sure about this? I would have thought the posh ones would have all remained in Tryas, or maybe been sent to a coastal city in the north,” Vernette commented as she examined Kitana from head to toe. </p><p>“Or maybe someone above has other plans for her. Who knows,” Mason replied with a half-shrug. He plopped down on the sofa to their side and retrieved his Euria pipe. “So, what’s the deal?”</p><p>“I think it’s better if I let Baron Cain do the talking. He’ll be here any minute. Would you like a drink, Kitana?” Vernette sat back in her chair, smiling gently.</p><p>“What deal are we talking about here? Are we not here to clean up the city?” Kitana ignored the offer, still playing the naïve, zealous girl. She also had to put up such an act in front of the bishop.</p><p>Vernette simply shot a fierce glare at Mason, who laughed in response. “Girl, as I said, let me do most of the talking here.”</p><p>“My name isn’t <em>girl,</em> it’s—”</p><p>Before Kitana could finish, the doors to the office swung open, with Baron Cain walking in with two knights. The baron was decked from head to toe in luxury—a posh velvet cap, a well-pressed suit adorned with jewels and initials on the cuffs, and a handkerchief sticking out of his breast pocket, nicely folded and marked with the insignia of the Yual Dominion. The knights were equally domineering, clad in arctech armor with engravings all over the painted metal. </p><p>“Ah, my requested inquisitors have finally arrived.” Cain smiled with open arms as he did not bow or salute any of them. He strutted across the room, and with a loud plop, he sat comfortably on the sofa next to Mason. The bishop and the two inquisitors immediately stood up and bowed with respect. </p><p>The nobility was far higher than those in the religious order, so even Bishop Vernette had to bow. Someone had to pay the budget.</p><p>“Hmm… You seem familiar,” Cain remarked as he took a closer look at Mason. </p><p>“Yes, sir. I’ve worked here with your father on a different operation in this city a decade or so ago. Inquisitor Mason at your service. Though I won’t claim to know the intricacy of the underground any longer,” Mason said respectfully.</p><p>“Ah! Then you’re the best man for the job. The nature of this operation is the same as before, and I’m sure you’ll meet a lot of old faces. I have a party to attend in an hour, so let’s get right to it. You two, bring out the map.”</p><p>The knights walked into the center of the office, unrolling a map of the city that had already been marked with red lines and red stars indicating points of interest. “Unlike other sectors in Raktor, the south is relatively stable. However, it is this stability that is hurting my finances. I take it you understand, Mason?” Baron Cain raised his eyebrows, taking note of Mason’s expression.</p><p>“Of course. You want us to rough up the current status quo. Keep them on their toes. Knock the gangs down a peg.”</p><p>“Exactly. But not too much, lest they start to move their ratholes around.” The baron held a wide grin on his face before his expression became even more solemn. </p><p><em>So, beat up the gangs a little to shake some money from their pockets. A protection racket, but run by the baron. Intriguing. </em>Kitana listened intently. </p><p>“There’s another reason I’ve asked you all to come here. There have been spies smuggling weapons out of our military factories and bases that are contracted to produce new types of guns and various classified arctech equipment. We lost a shipment a month ago, and I’m sure Bishop Vernette here recalls how that went.”</p><p>“Poorly. We didn’t find a single trace of it. Perhaps you can consider increasing the budget—twenty enforcers to a district of tens of thousands is hardly enough,” Bishop Vernette shot back. </p><p>“You can’t get military equipment out without having an insider,” Mason remarked. “If we don’t have access to the military personnel themselves, it would be difficult to clamp down on them.”</p><p>“That’s for the military to solve, not us. We don’t have the legal authority to do so anyway. However, it is clear that another organization within the South Sector is helping the insider, and I want to know who. If it’s that slimy Sebastian, I want to know immediately.”</p><p>“Sebastian is still around? Interesting.” Mason took a closer look at the map on the floor, counting the number of red stars marked. “That’s… That’s a lot of factories. Do we even have enough enforcers to cover them?”</p><p>“You don’t. I’m not planning to give you any more money until you prove your worth. Get the gangs to pay me, and maybe we can talk about increasing the budget.” </p><p>“Any leads?” Mason asked.</p><p>“None as of now,” Bishop Vernette replied in place of the baron. “But there are mild suspicions that it is the work of a foreign nation trying to steal our military technology. Or it could be neighboring Kregol and Perial trying to get the upper hand on us.”</p><p>“Those damn backwater counties are always jealous of Raktor. I have a good mind to petition the duke for a tribunal against them,” Baron Cain scoffed. “Regardless of who it is, under no circumstances can the technology be leaked any more, especially if it’s being sold to the civilian population. That last shipment was the final straw. Other barons have already increased checkpoints and security at the exits and entrances of the city.”</p><p>“I don’t understand. We’re here to protect some random factories instead of cleaning up the city?” Kitana interrupted the baron, her naïve, zealous act on full display. “From what I’ve seen on my way here, this entire sector is a lawless place! If you knew about it, you would have raised the budget immediately.”</p><p>Cain was slightly taken aback before an incredulous expression took over his face as he glanced between Mason and Vernette, who simply shook their heads in response. </p><p>“What? Why the fuck has everyone been hiding stuff from me ever since I got here?” Kitana challenged the three of them.</p><p>“Mason, could you please do the honors?” Cain gestured with his hands. </p><p>“Yes, sir.” Mason bowed, sternly walking up to Kitana. </p><p>“Wha—” Mason’s fist connected with Kitana’s face, the sound of her cheekbone cracking from the blunt force resounding in the silent room. Before she could stumble backward, Mason grabbed her by the uniform’s collar and kicked the back of her knees, forcing her to kneel in front of the baron. </p><p>Kitana groaned in pain as she held her broken nose, her mind spinning as blood trickled down through the seams between her fingers, staining the carpet. “What’s her name?” Cain asked Vernette.</p><p>“It’s Kitana, sir. I’m afraid she’s fresh from Tryas.”</p><p>“Fresh from Tryas… Well then.” Cain got up, patting his suit down before standing in front of her. “One rule to learn during your short, pitiful life here: don’t you ever fucking talk back to me. I pay the bills around here, so I’m the law. Got it? As for the rest of you, I expect to see results.” Cain spat on her head before leaving with the two knights. </p><p>The moment he left, Mason immediately took out a Health Potion and stuffed it in Kitana’s mouth, forcing her to drink it. The green aura slowly mended her face, but the blood stains remained. </p><p>“Girl, I already told you to leave the talking to me. What were you thinking, shouting like that?” Mason sighed as he let Kitana rest on the floor. </p><p>“Mason,” the bishop started. “If she doesn’t change, she’s quickly going to die here. You know someone above is counting on that.”</p><p>Kitana was still conscious, but delirious. “Who? Who is going to kill me?”</p><p>“Don’t you know why some fresh graduating inquisitors are sent to Raktor?” Mason asked, offering a hand to help her up. “It’s usually because of three things. One, you’re too talkative. Two, you’re too zealous. Three, you’re too naïve. And as far as I can tell, you’re all three.”</p><p><em>Might be true for the other nine, but they don’t know I’m the only one who volunteered myself because it’s where the most action happens… legally. </em></p><p>Kitana grumbled as she stood upright, slapping away the hand offered by Mason. “You’re telling me they trained me to be an inquisitor so I can look the other way? I still don’t understand what the fuck is the purpose of us coming here!”</p><p>Mason suddenly pulled out an arctech pistol, aiming it right at Kitana. Her training instinctively kicked in, with her trying to draw her pistol as well. However, her pistol was missing.</p><p>“Recognize this?” Mason motioned with his head to the pistol, which was clearly nicked from her. </p><p>“The truth is you’re a young, naïve, half-baked inquisitor who was sent here to die. Do you know why they don’t have to assassinate you? Because based on your current attitude, you would have died in less than a day on the streets of Raktor. You can’t even defend yourself or keep your pistol secured—what hope do you have against the gangs?” Mason berated her. “If I kill you right now, it would be a mercy.”</p><p>The sound of the arctech pistol’s safety being clicked frightened Kitana; her heart pounded as she stared at the barrel aimed at her forehead. Mason’s hand suddenly jerked, causing her to flinch instinctively. Opening her eyes slowly, she saw that Mason had tossed the pistol on the floor instead. </p><p>“Your safety was off,” Mason remarked as he sat back down on the sofa. “Look. I will do everything in my power to keep you alive for the duration of this operation. Once this is over, you can return to your zealous, holier-than-thou solo crusade and kill yourself for all I care. At least it’ll be off my record. Follow me, and I’ll train you to survive. Do we have a deal?”</p><p>Kitana nodded. “What are we going to do about protecting the factories? We don’t have enough bodies to cover all of them.”</p><p>“I heard there are a few organizations around this sector that specialize in protection; let’s knock down some doors tomorrow with a bit of lethal force, maybe talk with Sebastian. For now, get some rest.”</p><p>The two of them were shown to their quarters, a luxurious studio apartment. Kitana checked the room before closing the curtains, ensuring no one was spying on her. </p><p>She nearly couldn’t stop grinning as she checked her statistics again. <em>I was right to choose Raktor—I’m going to surpass my siblings within a year. With this much EXP running around the streets, who can stop me now?</em><h1><a id="_82k2qaojxnyw"></a>Chapter 17: Seductive Serpent</h1></p><p><em>A few days after…</em></p><p>Damian settled himself into the chair gingerly, reveling in the soft, smooth texture of the velvet. “Look at me, Keith! I’m the king now. King of the District!”</p><p>“You’d better get out of that chair before Kyle comes back.” Keith sighed as he continued pouring over financial reports and inventory lists. </p><p>“What? Can’t the underboss relax a little? I’ve been in this gang for so many years—I think my back deserves a bit of velvet.”</p><p>“We’re not out of the woods yet. We still owe a debt to the Crimson Swords—they are coming to collect the interest soon. If you really were the underboss, you’d get off your ass and check for opportunities!” Keith shot back, obviously stressed. </p><p>“Relax. As long as Kyle is at the helm, we’ll be fine.” Damian’s faith in Kyle was obviously at an all-time high due to the success against the Red Lions. At the start, he was simply watching and not fully committed as of yet. Being the underboss of a small gang was significant to him, but not as much as one would expect when the gang was only thirty members strong. But being the underboss of a gang that had taken down the Left Paw of the Red Lion? That was different. </p><p>“I’m flattered by the belief placed in me. Nonetheless, I believe that is my chair.”</p><p>Damian shot right out of the chair, quickly stepping out of the way as Kyle walked in. Keith also stood up, but Kyle waved at them to stand down. “No time for decorum. We have issues to discuss. We have yet to nail down exactly how to expand our operations. Let’s focus on that.”</p><p>Each of them took a seat, with Damian and Keith sitting opposite Kyle around the office table. </p><p>“As of now, we only have two businesses under our wing—a pub and a brothel. Which—”</p><p>“You mean the Lusty Arcian?” Keith interjected.</p><p>“Yes.” Kyle could have sworn they had an obsession with saying the name but chose to ignore it. “Which is far from enough to generate the profits necessary to pay off the Crimson Swords. We have less than three months to clear the debts, and due to the Alchemists’ Guild’s restrictions, our potion contracts are severely limited.”</p><p>Kyle didn’t really see a way around the restrictions. Sure, he could ignore the ban, but only if he had enough power and connections himself. Defeating a subset of the Red Lions was far from becoming dominant enough to ignore such rules, so until then, he would have to play ball with Haui. </p><p>“We can look for other avenues,” Damian pointed out. “Now that we have a reputation, we can begin to spread our influence throughout the district. Perhaps even begin some additional protection rackets as well.”</p><p>“No protection rackets for now. Such an extortive method would only serve to turn the current populace against us. We must position the Seven Snakes as a force for good overall, something integral to the survival of the district. The moment the locals perceive that there are more cons to having us around than benefits, that is the moment we fall.” Kyle elaborated. <em>Perhaps that is why I fell as well in my last life. </em></p><p>Damian scratched his head, not sure of what else to suggest. Protection rackets had been his main job under Ulon and their primary source of income, so he was lost on what to do next.</p><p>“What we need to do is a bit of market research,” Kyle continued. “The potions are one good example of us being able to enter the market, but it is limited and hampered by a strong guild. That very limitation allows the price to be far higher than its cost, so products like that are desirable.” </p><p>Keith caught on quickly. “So basically anything that is prohibited under the Sanctum of Yual, correct?”</p><p>“Exactly. Any leads?” Kyle deferred to Damian and Keith, who were obviously more knowledgeable about the local area. </p><p>Keith offered another suggestion. “How about guns? We could try to break into the weapons market.”</p><p>“I recently heard about two inquisitors arriving in the sector. Rumor is they’re here about guns, though I don’t have any details.” Damian said, rejecting Keith’s suggestion. He always had his ear close to the ground, having many connections with the locals due to his long years in the gang, so he was always being told all sorts of rumors. </p><p>“Then it’s best not to enter the gun market until we know exactly what is happening.” Kyle didn’t want to poke the hornet’s nest, not right after the visit from Sebastian. “We need something far more lowkey, something that everyone is doing, so that no one will bat an eye at the Seven Snakes joining in.”</p><p>“Smuggling is an option. Human trafficking pays fairly well with the slave trade being ubiquitous in Raktor. Even small gangs here do it.”</p><p>“Out of the question—that would also piss off the locals, and we don’t have the manpower to operate in other districts either,” Kyle said. “Operating there would also piss off the gangs in charge. Far too dangerous. However, you mentioned the small thug groups here. How many of them are there?”</p><p>“Well, it can be assumed that every block has about one to two. Our district has about fifty-four blocks populated, with another twenty abandoned, now occupied by squatters and others. Many small groups flock here because of the lack of enforcement, primarily from us rather than the enforcers,” Keith replied.</p><p>Such a high ratio of gangs would be unheard of in the other districts. Kyle sighed at their abysmal lack of influence, contemplating his next step. He had initially improved the performance of the brothel thanks to the addictive stamina potions, so the logical next step would be to improve the performance of the pub. </p><p>“Keith, any financial report on the pub?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, but the report doesn’t really make much sense. Some months, the pub reports a one-to-one ratio of revenue and operating cost.”</p><p>“Down to the last rakel?”</p><p>Keith nodded, his response setting off alarm bells in Kyle’s head. <em>Someone has falsified the accounts. Even such a business should experience seasonal changes due to events and holidays.</em> Kyle assumed it was Ulon, but he couldn’t rule out the possibility that the pub’s manager was also involved. </p><p>“Let’s check the pub that we own before making our next move.”</p><p>“You mean the Seductive Serpent?”</p><p>“Who the hell is coming up with these names?”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Unlike the brothel, which was run by the competent Slavin, the pub was an absolute disgrace, a place fitting of the name “watering hole.” The décor was shabby, the lighting dim and flickering, and the entire place stank to high Sanctum of Yual. Empty cups were barely cleaned, with some being left on tables for weeks. Dried residue of piss and vomit lined the crevices between shoddy wooden planks, and Kyle found it hard to find a piece of wooden furniture that did not have some sort of large crack along its length. </p><p>Near the rear of the pub were three thick, long ropes hung from corner to corner in a drooping curve, upon which a few Seven Snakes members were sleeping. </p><p>“Do our members not have beds?” Kyle asked Damian as he noticed Niko dangling on the coarse rope and snoring away peacefully while a dribble of vomit seeped from his mouth, piling up in the belly button of another blackout drunk below him. </p><p>“They do, but many prefer this idea of hanging over a rope.” Damian shrugged before walking up to what could be barely described as a bartender and slapping him awake.</p><p>“I… uh… Who… What?” The bartender groaned as he rubbed his cheek gently… and fell off the rope onto the floor in shambles. Seeing the man struggling to get up, Kyle’s impression of him dropped significantly. <em>I can’t have my bartenders getting drunk themselves.</em></p><p>“Keith, check the finances. Where’s the manager?”</p><p>“Uhh, sir? This is the manager.” Damian pointed to the obviously drunk bartender, who was now staggering all over the place, banging his head on the wall and collapsing. </p><p>“That’s not good.” Kyle’s gaze slowly turned dark, a simmering rage building within him at the sheer incompetence. Compared to the Lusty Arcian, this pub was a hellhole.</p><p>“Sir. There’s no financial record kept here. Everything seems to be written in this notebook.” Keith handed over a stained notebook filled to the brim with the tabs of each customer. Kyle flipped through the book quickly, noticing almost nine-tenths of the customers were Seven Snakes members, causing his heart to sink.</p><p>Furthermore, none of the Seven Snakes members had actually paid their tabs. The operational cost seemed to have been entirely fueled by the loan taken out from the Crimson Swords. <em>This isn’t even skimming off the top in some self-interested scam—it’s a complete self-scam!</em> </p><p>Kyle wanted to tear the entire place apart. “There’s nothing seductive about this place at all! Why is it called the Seductive Serpent?!”</p><p>“It used to be quite the spot, back in its heyday,” Damian replied. “Sir.” He added quickly as Kyle threw him a furious glare. </p><p>“Then for our members to continue drinking here, the alcohol must be somewhat passable.” Kyle took a seat on one of the creaky barstools, motioning to Damian to serve a mug. Damian immediately knew what to do, heading back into the storehouse to crack open a keg. “You seem to know your way around the bar.”</p><p>“I used to bartend here before joining the Seven Snakes.” </p><p>As the beer sloshed out of the keg and into the mug, a rancid smell filled the room, causing even the usually stoic Kyle to cringe in disgust.</p><p>“I think the beer is fine; been drinking it for three years, you know? Better than the swill we get at the squatters area,” Damian remarked, handing the mug over to Kyle. “Don’t judge a beer by its, err… smell. Or taste. And color.”</p><p><em>Then what do I judge it by? The bubbles?! </em>Kyle grimaced, slowly sipping a mouthful and drinking it, his eyes closed. “Any other types?”</p><p>“We got ale as well.” Damian repeated the process, with Kyle taking yet another swig. The gang leader sat in silence, his eyes still closed in what seemed to be deep contemplation. Damian watched expectantly as Kyle didn’t show any further disgusted reactions, buoying his hopes of validation.</p><p>Instead, the leader opened his eyes and stared at Damian before letting out a deep sigh, his anger seemingly lost. “Remind me not to trust your tastebuds ever again.” He didn’t really blame Damian for it, seeing as Damian would have never tasted better alcohol in the first place. Kyle was simply far too used to hypercontrolled alcohol, brewed in microgravity to maximize yeast fermentation, and its replicable taste. </p><p>“Hey, come on! You might be the boss, but I won’t have my taste insulted. Plenty of other folks in the district love this!” Damian took a stance. As strong as his belief in Kyle was, there were just some things he wouldn’t budge on. </p><p>“Then why are these ‘plenty of other folks’ not filling this pub?”</p><p>“Well, we pretty much serve the same thing as other pubs.”</p><p>“Really? Show me.”</p><p>Without warning, an impromptu pub crawl began, with Kyle sampling various nearby pubs run by locals. The other customers gave them a wide berth, recognizing their recent victory against the Red Lions. Even though Damian was in the midst of trying to prove a point to Kyle, he relished in the influence and reputation that he had garnered for himself. </p><p>Keith, too, was amazed at the attention and respect that they were receiving. He was never one to stand in the spotlight, but for the young man craving validation, the attention soothed his ego in just the right way, his demeanor far more upright than it had been before.</p><p>On the fifth pub, Kyle knew he had lost the argument with Damian. Every pub indeed had a similar-tasting beer and ale to what the Seductive Serpent served. However, it was a good thing. <em>This means I have caught a potential market.</em></p><p>Just as Kyle was about to conclude the pub crawl, the bartender of the fifth pub stopped him for a moment, offering a new drink on the house. “Got a new supply coming in recently. It’s leagues better than the beer. Here, give it a try.”</p><p>Kyle glanced at the drink, noticing it was a distilled hard liquor. “Moonshine? You made this yourself?”</p><p>“No, I’ve been getting it from someone else. Bunch of ragtags in the abandoned blocks.”</p><p>“What’s their name?”</p><p>“Oh, I wouldn’t know much about it…” The bartender shrugged, his palm faced upwards in an obvious gesture, prompting Kyle to retrieve a few dozen rakels, placing them on the counter. With a swift motion, the bartender grabbed the coins and slid them into his pocket before leaning over and whispering, “From what I know, they ain’t a part of any gang, you know? They do their own thing. I mean everything—brewing, supply, and even scouting. Apparently, the leader is an expert in alcohol brewing. Heard he even had done proper university research on it!”</p><p>“Any ideas where they are?”</p><p>“I didn’t ask, but I’m sure you’ll find them around the area. Considering you haven’t encountered them yet, I’ll say the crew is top-notch too. Their scout is really good at observing and planning routes. I’ve never heard of them being accosted by an enforcer either.”</p><p>Intrigued, Kyle tipped the bartender again to learn more information. As soon as he got everything he needed, he patted Damian and Keith on the back, prompting them to take their leave.</p><p>“Time to go. We got some moonshiners to catch.”<h1><a id="_jdovrz8mdhy4"></a>Chapter 18: Moonshine</h1></p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>In a derelict warehouse, a lone man was fiddling with a basic distillation apparatus, adjusting the angle of the condensation arm running into another doubler barrel. His hair was ragged, giving him a disheveled look, and his clothes were unkempt. However, his demeanor showed some semblance of noble mannerism, with a residual tinge of upper-class behavior in his actions. </p><p>A loud bang came from one of the side entrances, startling him. With a frown, he went over to see who it was. “Fucking hell, Monica, you gave me a scare. Maybe a simple knock would have sufficed.”</p><p>“Shut up, idiot. I ain’t got no extra hands carrying these sacks.” A burly lady had kicked open a small door with her right leg, her hands occupied as she hefted two large sacks of grains and sugar, sweat dripping down her white tank top.</p><p>With a loud grunt, Monica dropped them next to a mixing container. “Where’s Adrian and the rest? You the only one left in here?”</p><p>“Yeah. The rest went out to make sure there were no Seven Snakes slithering around. They’ve been getting real nosy with this district ever since they lost to the Red Lions.”</p><p>“Sounds about right.” Monica grabbed a well-worn concrete-crusted bucket and used it as a stool. “So, is Eric still the best distiller around here?” She motioned toward him with a mocking smile.</p><p>“It’s <em>Eric Dicar, </em>and yes, he should be the best in the district. Unless someone else somehow got the freshest mountain water from the Culdao Peaks nearby, we’ll monopolize the market over time.” Eric smirked.</p><p>“Well, cook it slow. We ain’t rushing for time. If we make too much of a bang, Kyle might show up.”</p><p>“Bah. It’s been two weeks since he was last seen negotiating with the Red Lions. Probably cooped up and huffing away at Euria Seeds with the way he’s been buying them off the market. His whole base is probably one big smoke cloud by now.”</p><p>Monica chuckled and stood up. She ripped the sacks open and poured them into a container, then ground them into a mash.</p><p>Eric continued to complain on the side. “Honestly, we should have gotten a much bigger pot. Our production scale is miserable. It’s barely ten gallons per batch at this rate.”</p><p>“Gotta stay portable. We don’t want to be pinned by the Seven Snakes or any other gang. If this district gets too hot, we shift. We agreed on this earlier,” Monica warned.</p><p>Eric didn’t reply, obviously unsatisfied, as he continued to tailor the temperature of the arcia stove before firing it up. Instead of asking Monica to dump the mash into the pot, they both waited, standing near the walls and peeking out of the barricaded windows of the warehouse.</p><p>“They’re taking far too long. Something’s up,” Monica mumbled after a few more minutes passed. She was about to ask Eric to pack it up when Adrian ran into the warehouse hastily.</p><p>“Fuck. The Seven Snakes are prowling nearby. If they so much as catch a whiff of the moonshine, we’ll be in trouble! I think they’ve been asking around for us!” Adrian gasped for air as he tried to catch his breath. “I had the other two walk in separate directions to pull off their trails, so we got maybe ten or fifteen minutes to move.”</p><p>“All right, just like we practiced.” Monica and Eric weren’t bothered at all. They had already moved through the various districts of the South Sector multiple times, exploiting the territorial gaps and derelict buildings in the vicinity. It wasn’t the first time they were hunted by the ruling gangs who obviously would not tolerate others subverting the alcohol production and smuggling business. </p><p>They packed up the equipment nicely, placing the pots and condensation arms into neat cardboard boxes before loading them up onto separate trolleys.</p><p>“Split up. We’ll meet at Point 23, got it?”</p><p>They had already premarked a series of locations in the vicinity where the operations could be performed. Even if squatters had moved in, simple intimidation or negotiations would usually suffice—a routine procedure.</p><p>Eric donned a felt cap with a flat top and put on a factory worker’s garments, making it seem like he was pushing basic supplies and scrap metal around. He slowly pushed the trolley through the streets on the side of the pavement, keeping his head down.</p><p>The streets were crowded and filled with business. Construction and food supply wagons rattled by while people loitered on the sides of the streets. Schoolboys played punk and played football in the alleyways while buskers strummed a sad song for rakels no one could afford to give.</p><p>Eric blended in nicely, acting like he was pushing supplies to another factory. He saw three Seven Snakes gang members head in the opposite direction, seemingly attempting to corner off their last known location. <em>Hah, dumbasses.</em></p><p>The relocation went off without a hitch, with Eric reaching the predetermined meeting point quickly. It was a run-down office-style building with large factory floors.</p><p>Eric pushed open the barricaded doors, hearing a loud scrambling inside and some whimpering. <em>I would say “fucking squatters,” but I’m not any different now, am I?</em></p><p>The first floor was an obvious slum, with makeshift barrel heaters blackened from the use of flammable materials. He saw five squatters in separate locations, keeping a wide berth from one another as they huddled up in as many clothes as they could, the stink unbearable from the pile of clearly unwashed linen stained with puke.</p><p>“All right, fellas, we’ll be here for a few days. In exchange, we’ll get you some moonshine, how about that, hmm? Maybe you guys can do a few deliveries for us too,” Eric asked from outside, peeking his head through the door. His voice echoed and wafted through the empty floor, easily reaching the ears of the squatters.</p><p>The squatters nodded. It was a common occurrence in the city of Raktor, and they wouldn’t say no to some free moonshine and extra cash.</p><p>“Good.” Eric didn’t enter with the trolley yet. Who knew if the squatters would suddenly decide to turn on him and take his equipment? <em>Better wait for Monica and the others.</em></p><p>Soon, Monica and Adrian arrived, both safe. “Anyone follow you?” Eric looked behind them, trying to spot anything suspicious.</p><p>“No, they were all checking out the last location, so we’re safe. I counted more than eight of them moving there. I really miss the days of Ulon. We could go unharmed for weeks.” Adrian sighed.</p><p>“Got a few squatters in there. We’ve reached a temporary agreement for a bit of swill and some movement.”</p><p>“Right. Let’s get the stuff in before we’re spotted.”</p><p>The three of them shifted the equipment and set it up just like before. Adrian scoped out the area, using a crowbar to smack one of the old, rusty doors to ensure they had a secondary exit in case of a raid.</p><p>Monica huffed as she lugged the heavy equipment back into place. “Shouldn’t have put the mash in first…” she said, slightly stumbling as she shifted it across from the trolley.</p><p>“We should be good for a few days, so we can start right now. Gotta deliver some before night.” Monica dumped the mash into the pot, and Eric started the fire. “Now we just have to wait.”</p><p>The three of them took a rest, rotating watch duty as they sat and lay on the floor. Eric took out a logbook, noting down the specific temperature, the type of condensation arm he used, and so on. It was important to note as it helped him improve his method of manufacturing. It was his livelihood, after all.</p><p>“‘Scuse me, good sir.” One of the squatters found the courage to talk to Eric after a good hour, while Monica and Adrian stared at the approaching squatter warily. “If you don’t mind me asking, what does this setup do?”</p><p>Eric’s eyes lit up brilliantly, like never before. With a slight cough, he stood up to his full bearing, assuming the gait of a university professor of sorts. “Glad you asked! This setup distills liquor in a deceivingly simple method, using pure Cornia, malt, and sugar. Mixing them and heating them allows us to distill vapor, which is concentrated through the doubler and subsequently through the worm.”</p><p>Monica rolled her eyes. “There he goes again. He just can’t help explaining this shit to everybody.”</p><p>“Ah, just let him have it. It’s not every day that he gets to act like what he used to be.” Adrian shrugged.</p><p>The other four squatters were enamored by the lecture provided. The questions asked were exceedingly childish and obviously uneducated, but Eric was more than happy to answer them.</p><p>“Sir Dicar, this is amazing!” One of the squatters stood next to Eric, staring at the setup with amazement. “With such a simple setup, we’re able to be free of the Sanctum of Yual’s inane bans. You could produce for the entire district!”</p><p>“Indeed. I strongly disagree with the alcohol prohibition. A mature man should be allowed to drink whatever he so desires. Such a ban implies a common lack of trust from the authorities, who are better than… Wait a minute… How did you know my surname?”</p><p>In a blink, the squatter next to him grappled Eric, pinning him to the ground, while the other four squatters, who had gradually gotten closer to Monica and Adrian, lunged toward them.</p><p>The two barely stood a chance against the surprise attack, having been caught completely off-guard. “What the?!” Monica struggled, but the squatter on top of her had expertly locked her limbs down in a martial art–style grapple. He took out an arctech radio, speaking fast. “Damian here, we’ve got them. Move in now.”</p><p>Eric instantly recognized the name. <em>The vice-leader of the Seven Snakes?! They fucking disguised themselves as squatters?!</em> Eric was dumbfounded. He had never seen a gang go to such extremes to catch them in his many years of being a moonshiner. “Is this even a gang anymore? You’re more like undercover enforcers!”</p><p>Damian didn’t reply. Soon, the eight Seven Snakes members entered, joining the disguised squatters and capturing the moonshiners. They hauled them and the equipment back to the Seven Snakes’ base, tossing them into the office.</p><p>As Eric struggled to get onto his knees with his arms bound, he already knew that there were two more captured in the office. They were the other two from his operations, having been caught long before they even relocated.</p><p>The five of them were about to start blaming one another on who snitched or was caught first, but the office door swung open with Kyle and Keith entering.</p><p>Kyle strode up to the office desk, his demeanor fierce. A domineering presence washed over the five of them, causing Eric to gulp internally. This was not his first time being caught, but it was an eye-opening experience. Somehow Kyle seemed to exude this sort of confidence and leadership that Eric had never seen before. The well-ironed formal suit Kyle wore further emphasized it as he leaned against the front desk, standing in front of the five groveling five members.</p><p>“Prepare a message to Wrent thanking him for his detailed information.” Kyle motioned to Keith, who bowed and sat at a new desk prepared just for him.</p><p>“Professor Dicar, what a pleasure to finally meet you. I’ve heard many rumors from your customers, mostly about your incredible skills and your time at the university.” Kyle looked down.</p><p>“If you truly find it a pleasure, perhaps you should consider my level of comfort being bound like this,” Eric scoffed as he lay like a worm on the floor, unable to lift himself.</p><p>“My apologies. You two, untie him and have him sit in the guest chair.”</p><p>Eric gingerly rubbed his wrists as the rope was undone before he sat and leaned back into the luxurious velvet chair. “Interesting that you put that much effort into capturing me and my crew. Getting bored of the potion business after a mere month and a half since becoming the leader?”</p><p>“When building an empire, it is better to diversify and hedge one’s bet. Also, pubs hardly run on potions alone.”</p><p>“Ah, entering the slavery business, I see.”</p><p>“I don’t intend to enslave you, Professor Dicar. Instead, I have an offer.”</p><p>“I doubt you have anything to offer that can weigh against my freedom,” Eric spat. He was well aware of how gangs wanted to use him to make their moonshine. <em>Brutes and grunts playing at nobility, ignorant of the true essence of brewing alcohol.</em></p><p>Kyle motioned for the two guards to grab Eric off the velvet chair.</p><p>“Please, follow me. I guarantee you will be interested.”<h1><a id="_orlopoq2goaj"></a>Chapter 19: New Ventures</h1></p><p>With the other moonshiners hauled off to holding cells, Eric was manhandled to another room. “Let go of me! I can walk by myself, thank you very much.” He tried to shake off the guards’ grips.</p><p>Kyle nodded his head as a signal, and the two guards let go of Eric. They walked through the common area, Eric taking note of the associates training hard against dummy figures or sparring with each other. Tons of Stamina Potions were stacked in wooden crates along the side, causing Eric’s mouth to fall agape in astonishment. </p><p>“I did not expect your production scale to be so huge,” Eric was astonished, estimating close to a thousand potions were stacked there alone, accumulated over the weeks. “I was under the impression that you were only supplying less than fifty per day or so.”</p><p>Kyle didn’t reply, still walking toward an unmarked door. They entered a separate room, and this time Eric’s jaw completely collapsed. Forgetting his predicament as a captured moonshiner, he ran forward, ogling at the unique distillation apparatuses that were far more advanced than anything he had ever seen, even at the university. </p><p>“I… I’ve never seen anything like this! Where did you get it from?” Eric was like an excited fanboy, jumping up and down as he examined the intricate details of the setup. </p><p>Kyle had implemented a factory-style distillation process, something he reverse-engineered from his memories. <em>Alcohol in the Galactic Era was produced much more efficiently, but at least the basic principles remained the same.</em></p><p>Eric suddenly let out a loud gasp. “This condenser is extremely unique! What is the jagged surface on the exterior of the condensation arm? This enchantment on the barrel—what does it do? Is it powered by arcia to give special effects?” He ran around a series of kegs, noticing they had unique enchantments on them as well that seemed to speed up the fermentation. </p><p>Kyle motioned for one of the guards to provide three samples in small cups. Eric was a bit hesitant, knowing there was a chance it could be poison or some sort. </p><p>“Professor Dicar, if I wanted you dead, I would have had you killed there and then, making it look like an accident.”</p><p>Eric finally relented and tried the first sample. It was a high-proof moonshine whiskey, free of any impurities, and smooth on the throat. “My God! It’s even better than anything I have tasted!”</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Moonshine Whiskey</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A high-proof whiskey distilled with precision and factory-level quality. None of that rugged taste</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Duration</strong>: Depends on the imbiber’s race</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He quickly drank the next sample, savoring the bubbling sensation with a sweet aromatic taste. “This is wine… but not one made from the usual ingredients… Grain wine? The sparkling sensation is not unique, but the combination is.”</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Cherry Sparkling Sake</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A sparkling rice wine made from polished grains. Smooth taste with a posh feeling</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Temporary Stat Effect</strong>: -5 INT, +3 STR. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Depends on the imbiber’s race.  </p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Eric then tried the last one. “Another grain wine, but this time with a burning sensation, highly distilled. The addition of the lemon taste gives it a secondary kick. Amazing! Where are all these recipes coming from?! I’ve spent my life studying alcohol, but I have never come across any of these!”</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Lemon-Flavored Soju</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A mixture of grains fermented. Mixed with a dash of lemon. Great with beer or yogurt</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Depends on the imbiber’s race.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>You’d probably lose your mind in the Galactic Era, then…</em> “Do you want to know?” Kyle asked with a knowing expression.</p><p>Eric’s excitement suddenly plummeted, the circumstances of his current plight coming back to him. “Cut to the chase. What do you want?”</p><p>“Work for me, and you’ll have this entire room, where those recipes came from, and a brand new pub.”</p><p>“And my crew?”</p><p>“They’ll be part of the gang. I’m counting on you to convince them.”</p><p>“What if I say no?”</p><p>“You already know what happens.”</p><p>Eric weighed the benefits in his head. For years, he had been a professor researching new methods of alcohol production. He had been expelled for no reason due to the sudden and rapid ban on alcohol, forcing him onto the streets in order to make a living. </p><p>Too many gangs had tried to recruit him, even with the threat of force, but a simple bribe and a few drops of moonshine were always enough to get the guards to go against their bosses and break away from the gang. That was how he met his current crew, anyway.</p><p>However, Kyle had shown him a new path, a chance to regain his old life. The new recipes lured him tantalizingly, and he couldn’t stop thinking about all the types of alcohol he could make with the setup in front of him. <em>Perhaps I can learn the recipes, then slowly get away as well. </em></p><p>“You have a deal. Let me talk to them.”</p><p>Eric was brought to the holding cell, where the other four moonshiners were still restrained. “Eric, you all right? Just agree to whatever they say; we’ll break out soon enough.” Adrian said, worried.</p><p>“Yes, I’ve accepted their deal. We will all be Seven Snakes members for now.”</p><p>“Great, I’m starving.” Monica’s stomach rumbled loudly. This wasn’t their first rodeo, having escaped a few gangs before. “We’ll be out of here in no time.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The pub restoration was now underway, with Kyle estimating that it may take two weeks to get it up and running. He had already fired the former bartender, and any existing Seven Snakes members who had a tab running were forced to work extra hard to clean up the messes. It was not any fun cleaning up a place where their own vomit and piss had caked into the seams, but no one dared to go against Kyle any longer, not after his showing of force in multiple fights. </p><p>It would still take some time for the new gang members to be accommodated, but Kyle already began to see an opportunity for expansion. However, he did not rush anything, instead building a solid, loyal power base and providing enough time for the integration of new members into the fold. It would be foolish to make any major moves or large recruitment campaigns where potential spies from both the enforcers and the Ardent Cretins would enter. </p><p>Damian soon returned from the induction of Eric Dicar’s crew. “Sir, the induction is complete, though I get this feeling that they may look for every opportunity to break free.”</p><p>“Keep a close eye on them. They are competent in their jobs, especially Adrian.” Kyle had managed to outwit them, not through prediction but by covering all possible hideout locations. Damian, being planted among the squatters, was just one of many members—Kyle had mobilized twenty members, split up to attempt to form a net around them. <em>If I can entice Adrian to remain with us, it will be of great benefit to my gang.</em> </p><p>Kyle was also aware of the seemingly close ties that the crew had with one another, something unusual in criminal groups. Holding one of them in the Seven Snakes would then serve as an additional guarantee against a potential backstab or departure. </p><p>“We should begin to appoint vipers to provide a sense of responsibility in order to tie them down.”</p><p>Damian nodded in agreement. “Just like the Red Lions’ squad leaders. It would be good to have an inner circle of trusted, competent members.” Kyle had already previously announced the position of viper, but no one had yet to fill that role. All the associates were still gunning for it. </p><p>“Only after vetting them for a month or so. Choose the most hardworking ones or those who are competent. For example, Eric Dicar, who will be the new bartender for the pub once it has been relaunched, assuming he sticks with us. And by the way, I’m thinking about changing the name.”</p><p>“What?! How can you change a name like Seductive Serpent? It’s a well-known name in the district!” Damian was shocked, his nostalgia for the pub screaming out.</p><p>“Well-known for being a hellhole,” Kyle shot back, but he had to admit internally that he currently did not have a better name for it. He was never the best at naming things; his daughter in his former life used to always complain about it.</p><p>“What should we do about that woman?”</p><p>“Monica? She can handle logistics for the brothel and the pub for now. But do have her and Adrian help out in the free soup kitchen and at public cleanup events as well.”</p><p>“Got it. Are we planning on selling the alcohol? I got a few contacts who might be willing to buy from us,” Damian offered, knowing the alcohol recipes by Kyle were bound to be a hit with the locals, especially if sold at an affordable price. </p><p>“Not for now. We’ll make it exclusive to the Seductive Serpent to draw in customers and turn them into loyal regulars,” Kyle replied before stopping as he saw a wide, shit-eating grin on Damian’s face. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing. Just glad you kept the name.”</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>Kyle was soon left alone in the office, pondering over the next steps. There was no doubt the performance of the pub would be greatly improved now, but it remained to be seen whether it would be enough to pay off the Crimson Swords’ debt. </p><p>The main two income streams were the potions contracts with other minor gangs and the Red Lions, as well as the Lusty Arcian. Kyle performed a quick calculation, noticing that they were still off target, unable to clear the debt within the time limit provided. <em>I can’t just sit around and wait for the pub to be completed—I have to look for other options.</em></p><p>It was already abundantly clear that the weapons and human trafficking markets were currently off-limits. Kyle had plans for a public soup kitchen and a regular cleanup event to integrate Seven Snakes into the local social fabric. By showcasing their worth and benefit, they could stave off any lingering hate accumulated by Ulon, as well as garner goodwill and potentially information from the homeless and squatters who would frequent the soup kitchen the most. <em>It will serve as a good recruitment zone as well. </em></p><p>Suddenly landing on another idea, Kyle quickly called for Keith to come. “Keith, I need you to find potential casino locations, preferably ones we can strongarm or buy over in good condition to reduce the amount of construction work needed.”</p><p>Keith nodded. Casinos were par for the norm amongst gangs in Raktor. “I’ll work with Damian on it. He knows much better than I do how to properly cover up a casino.”</p><p>“Good. Try to get it done at the same time as the pub.”</p><p>Kyle felt restricted; his movements were watched from every corner. It seemed as though he had been locked into his own sandbox by Sebastian and the other slightly larger gangs. He currently did not have the power to break through the implicit blockade, so he needed to find more advantages if he wanted to avoid succumbing to the debt. </p><p>Forgoing payment of the debt would also leave a big target on his back. Kyle was sure he was not the strongest person in the city, so enticing hitmen and assassins to target him was not an ideal scenario. <em>Best case, we pay off the Crimson Swords, and it’s a done deal. </em>The completion of the loan repayment would also further boost their reputation, improving their influence in the black market and allowing them to take out bigger loans. </p><p>Kyle’s eyes wandered to the map of the city beyond its borders, where the forests and monster regions lay. <em>If I can’t expand in the city, perhaps I can obtain benefits from beyond its walls. Out there, I would be less observed and tracked. </em></p><p>He still had to determine what benefits he could obtain outside the city. <em>Come to think of it, I have never left the city since I came here. I should ask Damian and Keith. </em></p><p>However, for today, he would need to make some personal preparations before leaving, such as boosting his knowledge of arcia and its uses. Kyle was well aware that arctech would be the key focal point of many battles to come—it would be wise to learn as much as he could over the next few weeks.</p><p>The technological level of the world he was in was haphazard, and unlike historical advancements, thanks to the existence of arcia. The past few days had him setting up the in-house brewery. In the night, he studied the tome left behind by Theorin in order to understand arctech better.</p><p>The book taught the basic engravings and how to combine them and overlay their effects. Kyle had already done a preliminary implementation of the fermentation of mash in the kegs, allowing him to implement a simple decay engraving, accelerating the fermentation process and subsequently the production of alcohol.</p><p>If he had his way, he could implement microgravity brewing fermentation processes from the Galactic Era here. However, such engravings that could manipulate the very laws of physics were naturally extremely rare.</p><p><em>Arcia is far too amazing. If discovered, such an exotic material would have the entire human quadrant scrambling for it. </em>Kyle had yet to find evidence that he was even in the same universe or timeline as his original one, though he still did not believe that arcia was magic or fantasy.</p><p>It was more like electricity—radiation and oil—which the locals might also consider magical. <em>Anti-gravity, plasma weapons, and faster-than-light travel would be considered “magic” by the people here…</em></p><p>The study of enchantments had yet to yield a title or a bonus of sorts from the reading. Kyle surmised that it was a lack of implementation—he had always been rewarded for repetitive action rather than learning. </p><p>He returned to his room, where there were more than two dozen ordinary metal pipes on a table, along with Riker’s next to it. A single needle-like etcher hooked up to a portable arcia generator was placed as well, Kyle having bought it to practice. </p><p><em>Repetition is the key to success, after all.</em> Kyle sat down and began etching away at the metal pipes, copying the engravings on Riker’s. Right now, he only had a few pieces of arctech equipment, most of which were stolen from the Red Lions’ members.</p><p>It would be good if he could customize his own armor set and weapons. He dearly missed his exosuit from his former life, which made him wonder if he could replicate it in the future. The overlaying of enchantments and engravings reminded him of how nanocircuit boards were made. An arcia-printed circuit board did not seem too far out of the question. <em>Something to keep in mind.</em></p><p>The title was not as easy to reach as previous titles were, requiring multiple days of non-stop practice. As he reached his hundredth copied metal pipe, a title was finally awarded to him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Arcia Engraver (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>Damian ladled fresh soup into a bowl before handing it over to a disheveled young man. “There’s bread to go with it. Go over to that man there.” He pointed to Niko, who was busy serving an endless queue of homeless people desperate for free food. </p><p>“Thank you so much!” The man bowed respectfully and joined the queue. Damian genuinely smiled before serving the next person in line. The Seven Snakes had booked an area near the food market, spreading the word through the locals that they were offering free meals to those in need, no questions asked. There were obviously a few who feigned poverty just to save a few rakels, but it didn’t matter. The cost of the soup kitchen was barely a dent in their finances, and its benefits far outweighed its cost.</p><p>Some of the nearby food stall owners complained about the surge in homeless people who smelled like rotten eggs, but the local people in general looked favorably on the initiative. Neither the enforcers nor the Sanctum of Yual hardly did anything like this; if they did, it would always lead to a conversion. Many of the homeless didn’t want to be exploited or tangled up in some religious mess despite being citizens of the Yual Dominion, so they were more than appreciative of what the Seven Snakes were doing. </p><p>Monica and Adrian entered the soup kitchen with a few others, all of them panting as they held brooms and large buckets filled with trash picked up from the side of the street.</p><p>“Good work. Take a breather and head out to the next street when you’re ready. We got to clean up the next three streets before nightfall.”</p><p>“THREE?!” Monica was about to lose her mind, but Adrian hastily tried to calm her down. “We’ve been sweeping the entire day!”</p><p>“Better than wasting your life away making swill in random buildings, no?” Damian smirked. “You’ll get used to it.”</p><p>Monica seriously contemplated running away with her crew, but Eric was trapped inside the base, spending almost all his time in the new brewery. She had an inkling Eric did not actually want to leave and began to weigh whether her freedom was worth ditching Eric.</p><p>“Psst, Adrian. You wanna try to escape later?”</p><p>“Escape?” Adrian pondered for a moment, the hesitation clear on his face. </p><p>“What? Don’t tell me you like taking orders from these cunts.”</p><p>“I don’t, but to be honest, they are doing something good here.” Adrian motioned to the soup kitchen. “I used to be a squatter myself before you recruited me; you know that. What they have now is nothing short of amazing to me. And I really feel much better and at ease doing something upright here.”</p><p>Monica scoffed. “They are doing this so they can collect information across the district through the squatters and scout potential recruits. You know this!”</p><p>“Doesn’t change the fact that they are getting free meals. It don’t matter to me what they do—at least they are alive and full.”</p><p>While the two of them bickered, a Seven Snakes associate ran up to Damian. “Sir, Boss Kyle wants to meet you in his office right away.” </p><p>Damian dropped everything, handing his role over to another before making it back to the base. As he entered the office, Keith and Kyle were already discussing something important, which shocked Damian.</p><p>“You want to venture out beyond the city?” Damian exclaimed in surprise. “But why now? We just secured our ownership of the district, and the pub is about to be finished!” </p><p>“What we have right now isn’t enough. Even with the in-house brewery, potion contracts, and the new casino and pub on the way, it would be impossible to clear our massive debt on time. If we default on that debt, everything we own right now would be up for grabs by the Crimson Swords,” Keith explained. </p><p>Damian sighed, crossing his arms as he looked at the map of the nearby regions around the city of Raktor. “So what can you possibly get outside the city that can benefit you? Everyone from the villages came to the city to make money—moving back doesn’t make any financial sense.”</p><p>“That’s not true.” Kyle pointed to a few regions nearby. “Every resource and commodity within the city is harvested or collected from the outlying villages or monster regions. For example, Keith and I have been tracking the production of Yul’s Tears, which we use for our Strength Potion. It’s extremely inefficient and requires adventurers to forage for it in the mountains.”</p><p>“If you manage to get a stable supply, undercutting the market will bring eyes to us again. Aren’t we limiting ourselves to this district for now because of Sebastian’s warning and the inquisitors?”</p><p>“Indeed, which is why we need to establish a shell company that will begin to supply the other sectors. We need a front to deflect attention while collecting the money. In short, raw material production should be industrialized, allowing us to reap the profit from economies of scale.” </p><p>“But what material should we be targeting?” Damian tried to rack his head. There were so many materials that they could focus on, but which one would provide the most profit?</p><p>“Keith?” Kyle motioned with his hand.</p><p>“Yes, sir. The report you asked for on individual consumption that has a good potential for future restrictions is ready. While the sample size is limited to this district alone, consumption of Euria seeds for personal enjoyment is quite high. Nearly fifteen percent of the population smokes it right now. Food tops the chart, but the ingredients used are far too diverse to compete against Euria seeds.”</p><p>Damian quickly raised an objection. “Wait, wait, wait. Shouldn’t we be targeting prohibited stuff like we discussed previously? Maybe like the raw ingredients for alcohol or arcia itself? What about Yul’s Tears? That’s expensive.”</p><p>“The objective of this expedition is not to spook any gang or enforcers. We don’t have a clear picture of how the other gangs are getting their supply, so doing anything related is slightly dangerous, especially since we’re aiming to enter other sectors and districts.” Kyle had clearly learned his lesson from moving too fast. He had assumed this world was a simple pushover, but it was far more intricate than he thought. It was not going to be that easy to climb the ranks. </p><p>“Yul’s Tears directly affect the Alchemists’ Guild, so doing anything related to that would make Haui’s partnership and protection meaningless. I am willing to consider legal ventures as a way to make money.” </p><p>It was not rare for criminal gangs to operate legitimate businesses. It helped to both obfuscate and complicate investigations into how far the criminal network spread. Kyle also considered it a diversification of revenue beyond just illegal stuff. </p><p>“Okay, so Euria Seeds. There are a few plantations of the stuff nearby, but nothing of a large scale yet, which is why it is relatively expensive. Probably impossible to buy them over with our current cash reserves,” Damian pondered out loud. “Euria Trees are native to the Culdao Peaks, which are infested with monsters, mostly goblins.”</p><p>“Goblins?” Kyle was confused. </p><p>“Yeah. Small, little deformed things. Extremely primitive. There are a couple of dens around the area. Some adventurers have them estimated at two hundred per den. Very territorial. There’s a small town nearby where you can gather some information. Most of the adventurers have a base there.” Damian pointed to a mark on the map. </p><p>Kyle remained quiet for a while, contemplating. “Can the goblins understand human language?”</p><p>“Only fundamental words, but yes, communication is possible. But they generally kill on sight, so it’s preferred to avoid them whenever possible. You’re not planning anything funny, are you?”</p><p>Kyle let out a slight grin, the same whenever he had a plan in play. “Have the pub and casino ready by the time I come back. It’s time for a small excursion.”</p><p>A slight shudder went down Damian’s spine. <em>Why do I feel bad for the goblins now?</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>At the edge of the South Sector bordering the West Sector was a towering gate embedded in the ancient walls of the city. It was one of the major entrances into Raktor. Thousands of caravans dragged by horses and donkeys went to and fro, many from the neighboring county of Kregol, passing by the immigration checkpoints. </p><p>A timetable lit up in dull blue arcia lines showed all the private transportation services to nearby villages, towns, and even other cities. Passengers wearing thick winter coats and dragging their luggage ran down the crowded cobblestone street, trying to find their assigned caravan, some sighing as they missed their ride.</p><p>Adventurers, mercenaries, and local gang members from the Veiled Angels and the Ardent Cretins were hanging around as well, as were local enforcers who performed random inspections on passing cargo. There seemed to be a sort of tacit agreement between the Veiled Angels, the Ardent Cretins, and the local enforcers—any wagon marked by the gangs was not inspected at all, or at least the enforcers closed one eye when they saw what was inside. Such was business at the overlap between major sectors.</p><p>A lone cloaked man held onto a thin ticket detailing the time and destination. He squinted at the timetable, trying to decipher the myriad of lines that changed rapidly. </p><p>“LAST CALL! LAST CALL FOR CULDAO PEAKS TOWN!” A young boy yelled with a loudspeaker as he stood on top of a stack of boxes. “AT BERTH 19-C, RIGHT NOW!”</p><p>The cloaked man shifted the backpack on his back and began to move, slightly buffered by the sheer number of travelers and peddlers shouting at the top of their lungs, selling goods and potions of all sorts. </p><p>“Traveling alone? Need some companionship? Buy this crazy lizard off me right now—sure to keep you company with its incessant laughter! If you feed it right, it can grow to human size and laugh even louder! No, seriously, buy it off me. I can’t shake the damn thing off! One rakel!”</p><p>“Sleeping Potions! Don’t get woken up by snores or even a bandit attack! It ain’t worth your time! Just let them rob the others! Hell, just let them rob you! Sleep is way more important!”</p><p>“A headband engraved with a silence skill! Why even tolerate the dumb idiots in your wagon wagging their tongues? Get one now for five hundred rakels!”</p><p>“Afraid of your wagon and cargo being overturned? Hostile monsters got you surrounded? Don’t worry; our emergency response mercenary team got you and your merchant business covered. Simply activate the device in trouble, and our nearest patrol will respond immediately, no matter the threat. Only for the low, low cost of two hundred thousand rakels!”</p><p>“Arctech wagons too slow for your liking? We got the fastests likrids on hand, race-winning steeds that haul you a thousand yards in a jiffy! Comes with an attached handler too for an additional cost!”</p><p>The cloaked man shoved his way through the dense crowd, pushing past weary travelers and dumb tourists from the towns and villages gaping at the sight of the city. He soon made it to Berth 19, where a gruff man in dirty overalls was impatiently tapping his foot as he leaned against the metal-spoked wheels of a covered wagon dragged by two obviously jittery horses. His eyes glanced at the cloaked man, eventually landing on the flimsy ticket he was holding. </p><p>“You the guy I’ve been waiting for?”</p><p>“Only if this is the transport to Culdao Peaks.”</p><p>“Finally! Get on. I’m already ten minutes behind schedule. My boss is going to whip my ass if I run any later.” The gruff man motioned to the back of the wagon, where there were already five others sitting in place. </p><p>The cloaked man gingerly entered the wagon and placed his backpack on the floor, nodding with respect to the other passengers before sitting down quietly. The other five were already engaged in a seemingly heated debate as the wagon moved out from the berth, the cobblestones causing the seats to rumble violently as it jerked back and forth. </p><p>“Look, I don’t know what kind of Euria you’ve been sniffing, but there’s no chance in hell the inquisitors are going to allow any sort of gang or secret society to exist in Raktor again. Mark my words; it’ll be a short few years till Raktor will finally be cleansed!” One of the more wealthy passengers, who seemed to be a merchant, scoffed. “I’d rather have a healthy business environment than a dangerous one when I have to succumb to the gangs.”</p><p>“You really believe that? First time in Raktor? Hundreds of inquisitors have come and gone, half of them even dying. We got the highest enforcer death rate in the damn Yual Dominion. This time ain’t any different. They only come in when the nobles’ pockets are being threatened or they are looking to expand. To me, the bans are ridiculous and just a façade for the enforcers to take in anyone—no one outside of the major city even adheres to it,” another merchant rebutted angrily. </p><p>“I agree. The bans are far too ridiculous and should be lifted.” A third merchant chimed in.</p><p>“Prostitution is a sin! Drunkenness is a sin as well!” The first merchant angrily wagged his finger at the other two. “This world is sorely lacking in morals, and I, for one, am glad the inquisitors are here to purge them!”</p><p>The wagon suddenly came to a halt, with two Sanctum enforcers checking for their identity. Each of the passengers handed over their identity card as well as a city permit. </p><p>“Kris Grayborn…” The enforcer looked at the face of the cloaked man, comparing it to the identity card. He was a bit suspicious, but the enforcer couldn’t be bothered to pursue the matter, signaling to the front to let the wagon pass. The cloaked man let out a sigh of relief internally. <em>Guess I haven’t been marked yet by the enforcers. </em></p><p>Kyle stared out of the back of the wagon, looking at the towering stone walls engraved with various glyphs, boosting its defense. It wasn’t until they had moved far away enough up a hilly slope that he truly saw the scale of the city, sprawling across a large area with a massive river flowing through it. The South Sector looked tiny in comparison with the horizon, but it didn’t surprise a galactic crime lord, who always had his sights further.</p><p><em>Finally, I’m out of the city.</em><h1><a id="_wox96oazuhul"></a>Chapter 21: Forest Ambush</h1></p><p>“We’re camping here for the night; one more day to the Culdao Peaks.” The gruff man, who doubled as the driver, motioned to a rest area that other travelers had used countless times. It was a clearing in a forest a bit further away from the main road but still big enough to have ten people sleeping in comfort. </p><p>Kyle did not set up any equipment like the rest of them, simply sitting on the ground and leaning slightly against his backpack, observing the surroundings. </p><p>The stars were clearly visible, though the constellations were all far different from what Kyle could recognize. <em>Is the orientation different, or am I truly in a different world?</em> Kyle still couldn’t believe he had reincarnated in a different world, having grown up in the Galactic Era, where science dominated. </p><p>In any case, he could not read the stars—space travel in his former life was all done by A.I. star trackers that automatically did the calculations. He was not trained as a navigator either. However, he could see that the Milky Way Galaxy was not visible at all, a slightly faint pinkish hue enveloping the background instead. </p><p><em>I’ll figure it out when I gain more resources and power.</em> Kyle turned his attention back to the passengers. The three merchants were still bickering over the arrival of the inquisitors, making Kyle slightly regret not having bought the headband that supposedly silenced the environment. </p><p>“They are a feisty bunch, aren’t they?” one of the other passengers remarked as he sat down next to Kyle. He flicked his hood off, revealing glossy black hair slicked back and a small scar across his nose bridge. He held out a hand, offering a handshake. “Name’s Orthon, mercenary heading back to Culdao Peak. You?”</p><p>“Kris. I’m an herbalist, looking for new potential medicine there.” Kyle shook his hand briefly, noticing the calluses on his palm and the unmistakable mark of a sword wielder. </p><p>“Oh, without an escort? Could get pretty dangerous.” Orthon sized up Kyle, looking at his cloak and equipment, his eyes landing on the Aero Shoes for a while.</p><p>“Those three merchants seemed to be doing fine without any help.” Kyle noticed Orthon’s gaze but did not react. He eyed a repeating crossbow slung across Orthon’s back, loaded with bolts. It was extremely luxurious and ornamental—almost as if it were meant for nobility. An interesting violet mark was painted across its body, shaped like a demon.</p><p>“Of course, they got escorts! Me and my buddy, Troy.” Orthon motioned back toward the last passenger, who simply nodded as he re-tied his bow, checking the tension of the string. “It looked like an easy job; both of us were already heading that way, so we just grabbed some easy money along the way.”</p><p>“How much was it?”</p><p>“Oh, not much. Just three hundred rakels per person. Barely enough in total to buy a Strength Potion, but enough to survive if you know where to buy your food in Raktor. Why? Interested in hiring us?”</p><p>“Perhaps. I’m looking for native Euria Seeds.”</p><p>“Hmmm.” Orthon scratched his chin. “I know they are in the Culdao Peaks, but I don’t know where the largest concentration is. You might want to ask around in town.”</p><p> “Thanks. I’ll give it a shot.”</p><p>“No worries, mate. If you ever need help, just head down to the tavern and ask for me or Troy. We’ll be around for a month or two. Gonna go for a quick wee.” Orthon patted Kyle’s shoulder before leaving into the bushes, causing Kyle’s eyebrow to twitch slightly at being touched.</p><p>Kyle watched Orthon leave, shifted his backpack a bit further away from the campfire that was just set up and laid down to try and get some rest.</p><p>“Mr. Grayborn? Want any soup before resting?” the gruff man called out, but Kyle acted like he was sleeping soundly.</p><p>“Hey, I’ll gladly take his portion if he doesn't want it.” One of the merchants scooped a bowl quickly and gulped it down, burping with satisfaction. The gruff man also drank the soup, with Troy watching them intently.</p><p>Soon, they fell fast asleep, the rumbling of snores echoing through the rest area. Troy pretended to sleep as well, waiting for the merchants to be in a deep slumber. As soon as they did, his eyes slowly opened. <em>Time to make a move. </em></p><p>He slowly got up and turned his head, looking into the forest, before signaling with a soft whistle three times. Slowly realizing something was wrong, he glanced around the area. <em>Where is Kris Grayborn? His backpack is still here. Did Orthon make a move first?</em></p><p>Wary, he retrieved his bow and was about to walk out into the treeline when someone suddenly dropped onto him from above, slamming him onto the ground with both knees pinning his shoulder blades. </p><p>“ARGH—” Troy screamed, but a ragged piece of cloth was stuffed into his mouth, muffling the sound. Unable to turn around, he felt five hammer strikes hit his body at different positions of his limbs, causing him to yelp in pain. </p><p>Kyle walked off to grab a rope from his backpack, while Troy immediately spat out the cloth and tried to stand up, pulling out a knife sheathed in his belt and aiming it at Kyle. Kyle did not react, simply walking toward Troy with the rope. </p><p>Before Troy could move a single inch, the delayed pain from the neon red arctech hammer kicked in, causing him to scream again. Kyle immediately lunged forward and grabbed his cheeks, toppling Troy’s head into the ground with a loud thud and knocking him out. </p><p>Despite the screams, the merchants and driver did not wake up, barely budging. <em>Drugged by the soup…</em> Kyle tied Troy up and dragged him into the treeline, hiding his body in the bushes. Kyle waited at another position, planning to ambush anyone coming. </p><p>After a few minutes, two men and Orthon walked out of the treeline toward the campfire with large grins on their faces. “We’re getting rich today, boys! Check the merchants for any emergency response devices. Can’t have them calling them on us.”</p><p>The two men complied, moving forward, when suddenly Orthon grabbed them by the shoulder. “Wait! Something isn’t right! Troy and the new guy are missing!” </p><p>Just as the two men began to glance around, a shadow lunged out from the sides, accelerated by his shoes. The shadow swung a neon red hammer, delivering a direct uppercut to the first man, immediately knocking him out cold. </p><p>“Shit!” Orthon cursed, pulling out his own sword. The other man began to panic as Kris leapt and weaved around him before delivering a sweeping kick and swinging the hammer in a downward strike as the man fell. </p><p>The hammer strike cracked the man’s ribs, causing bone splinters to jut out from under the skin from the sheer force. Another swift kick to the head knocked out the man for good as well. </p><p>A sudden swing of the sword forced Kyle to back off, the sound of air rippling as Orthon grunted. “Who the fuck are you? An enforcer? Or the Veiled Angels? I doubt you’re a Cretin—Sebastian would have you flogged for this.” Orthon didn’t chase after Kyle, instead retrieving the ornate repeating crossbow with his free hand, the cocking mechanism engraved with arcia. </p><p>Kyle assumed the force of each shot would be light due to the size, but the arcia enchantments along the length improved the force, accelerating the bolts faster than he expected. Two bolts whizzed past his head, while a third hit him in the left shoulder, causing him to stumble back. Blood trickled out as Kyle staggered, pain jolting through his nerves like a sharp lightning bolt.</p><p>“Never expected this, huh?” Orthon grinned, gripping the sword with the other hand and approaching carefully, assuming the stance of a well-trained sword duelist. With a powerful step forward, Orthon unleashed a three-move combo, swinging with all his might. </p><p>He nearly nailed Kyle with the second swing, but on the third swing, Kyle suddenly parried with the handle of his hammer before closing in the gap in a daring forward step, catching Orthon off guard. Capitalizing on the surprise, Kyle threw a strong left hook right into Orthon’s jaw, knocking him back into a daze. </p><p>Orthon was no slouch, quickly using his sword to force Kyle to back off, though the latter was already well prepared, dancing around Orthon despite the bolt in his left shoulder. With another exchange, another knee to the stomach from Kyle caused Orthon to collapse to the floor. Kyle swung the hammer down on the back of his opponent’s head three times, knocking him out cold as blood trickled through the man’s hair.</p><p>Kyle panted, moved to a tree stump, and slumped against it. Luckily for him, the crossbow bolt was fairly shallow and not fully embedded in the bone. Kyle used his fingers with grit, digging into the exposed flesh himself as he winced. He located the arrowhead and slowly eased it out, bearing the pain. </p><p>Soon, he managed to pull out the entire shaft and arrowhead and used the Necklace of Healing to heal himself lightly as a temporary measure. The wound sealed up as a green aura surged around it, boosted by his Healer title. </p><p><em>Nifty for post-battles, but that’s assuming I win the battle in the first place. </em>Kyle stood up, testing his shoulder’s articulation. The healing had yet to be complete—Kyle would have to channel it a few times later. Picking up Orthon’s crossbow, he examined it. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Ornate Repeater Crossbow (Intermediate)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle had yet to acquire a ranged weapon, so he held on to it, slinging it behind him. He walked up to one of the unconscious attackers, wondering what to do with him. </p><p>Kyle noticed he had not gained any EXP so far. The last time he had gotten any EXP was only when he killed Ulon Baktar, the former Seven Snakes gang leader. Even beating up a dozen Red Lions did not net him anything. <em>Is the System forcing me to kill? That’s fine, but surely I can get more benefits out of it?</em></p><p>He retrieved Troy’s dropped knife, using it to quickly slit the throat of one of the unconscious men, killing him on the spot. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Forest Bandit, +50 EXP.</p><p></p><p>Kyle waited for a while, noticing there were no new titles. <em>Perhaps I have to do it differently.</em> He walked up to the second unconscious man, slitting his wrists and allowing the blood to seep out slowly. He then stabbed the man a few times, causing him to wake up from the sheer pain and scream out. It ended with a quick jab to the nose, knocking the man back out. </p><p>Soon, the blood formed a sizeable puddle, prompting another System Message to appear in front of him.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Forest Bandit, +50 EXP.</p><p></p><p><em>Huh, let’s focus on getting information, then. </em>Kyle moved on to the next. This time, he grabbed Troy’s body and slapped him awake. </p><p>“Burh…” Troy groaned as he was abruptly woken up before his eyes narrowed in shock. He tried to break free of the rope that tied his arms and legs.</p><p>“Who are you affiliated with? Why did you guys assume I was the Veiled Angels?”</p><p>“W-What? I—” Troy was still lightheaded from the previous concussion but soon shrieked in pain as Kyle used the knife to dig into the ribs.</p><p>“Answer.”</p><p>“I… We’re affiliated with the Violet Demons! We hijack caravans for them! Please let me go!” Troy struggled against the knife while he began bleeding profusely.</p><p>“How many of you are there?”</p><p>“Twenty, no… forty! Sixty! Let me go now, or they’ll hunt you down! Orthon is a big shot among us. If you kill him or me, you’re dead meat!” Troy tried to intimidate Kyle, but the galactic crime lord was not having any of it.</p><p>“So I’m questioning the wrong person then,” Kyle summarized before pulling out the knife and stabbing Troy in the heart. Troy’s body convulsed violently for a few seconds, his limbs twitching until he finally slumped over and died.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Forest Bandit Troy, +100 EXP</p><p></p><p><em>Last try, then. </em>Kyle walked up to the unconscious Orthon, tying him up with a rope and slapping him awake.</p><p>“Uhh… wha… WHAT?!” Orthon stared in shock, unable to come to terms with the sheer amount of blood and gore around him. His comrades’ bodies were stacked next to him, dripping slowly in a dark-red snaking river that oozed toward him. “You… Who the fuck are you!? What kind of enforcer does this?”</p><p>“Who says I’m an enforcer?” Kyle suddenly stabbed a knife deep into Orthon’s thigh, gouging the bone. “I’m the one asking the questions here. Answer correctly, or else you’ll end up like them.”</p><p>“I’m not going to give you any—GRRRNNH!” Orthon winced as the knife was buried deeper with a twist, the pain nearly causing him to scream.</p><p>Kyle didn’t stop, continuing to twist. “STOP! STOP, OKAY?! PLEASE!” Orthon relented after three more twists, his thigh already a bloodied mess through his pants. </p><p>“Where is the forest bandit’s base?”</p><p>“South of here, seven kilometers. Wooden fortress, you can’t miss it.”</p><p>“How many of them are there?”</p><p>“There’s… about twenty-five of us.”</p><p><em>So Troy really was useless. Or Orthon is lying. </em>“All as equipped as you?”</p><p>“No… ARGGGHHH! YES, YES! WE HAVE BOWS AND CROSSBOWS!”</p><p>Kyle stopped twisting the knife for a moment, thinking deeply. Orthon noticed the hesitation in Kyle’s eyes. “T-That’s right! If you kill me off as well, my comrades are going to be hunting you down! No one escapes us in this forest. This is our home ground!”</p><p>“That sounds bad.”</p><p>“Yes, it is. So if you wanna live, you’ll—” Orthon couldn’t speak any more, his eyes bulging as he choked on his blood, his windpipe sliced open cleanly by the knife. He stared at Kyle, who did not even continue to look at him, walking off. Kyle couldn’t care less about the gurgling forest bandits—he was more occupied with the new system messages in front of his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle arrived at Culdao Peaks Town by foot, walking all night along the main road while chugging Stamina Potions whenever he was exhausted.</p><p>It was the crack of dawn by the time he arrived, but he did not enter the town immediately, instead tossing the bloodied clothes into a ditch nearby before changing to a clean set from his backpack.</p><p>He entered the town casually, acting like a traveler who had walked from the city due to missing the caravan. No one cared about him appearing, with Culdao Peaks being a regular stop point for travelers on foot or by wagon.</p><p>Culdao Peaks Town was a small place of close to eight hundred people, primarily hamlets, a few high streets of shopping stalls, and a central market. Already, Kyle could see the stall owners working hard, dragging out items unsold since yesterday and hoping to make a quick buck. </p><p>Looking around for an inn, he found the best one he could get, paying with rakels on the spot no matter the quoted price. Why should a crime lord live in squalor or stinge, after all? A few hundred rakels would barely make a dent in the debt either way. However, Kyle could already imagine Keith nagging him for spending two hundred rakels for a single night.</p><p>The inn was quiet in the morning, and the sleepy attendant, who had barely woken up, led him to his room, which was furnished with a queen-sized bed and a private bathroom. While not much in the Galactic Era, this was a luxury, especially when this was not the city. </p><p>As he walked through the inn, Kyle had been keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. His vigilance grew even bigger when he was finally left in the room, where he checked every nook and cranny for any engravings, enchantments, or devices. A habit from his former life. </p><p>Kyle finally loosened up after an hour of searching, lying on the comfortable bed. His mind recalled the system message about him receiving a class upon reaching Level 10. <em>Classes… What are they?</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></strong>: <strong>Classes</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>What? Terminal? Class Change? Milestones?</em> Kyle had never heard any of these terms before. He tried asking more, but no more system messages appeared. It seemed like that was the only question that had triggered an active response from his interface so far.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Information</strong></strong>: Classes Generated</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle glanced through the classes, none of them even being mildly interesting. The Biochemist class seemed interesting, but there was more to running a criminal empire than just drugs alone. <em>Nothing short of Crime Lord or its equivalent is good enough to satisfy me. </em>Kyle thought, which suddenly prompted the system message to disappear and a new one to appear.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Information</strong></strong>: Generating Unique Class</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle’s face twitched slightly at the mention of “self-preservation.” <em>Is this interface mocking me for what happened in my former life?</em> He begrudgingly accepted the class in his mind, causing the message to disappear and a new one to take its place.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>WARNING</strong></strong>: Class Integration Beginning</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Huh? Safe location? </em>Kyle barely had time to worry about it when a sudden jabbing pain erupted at the nape of his neck.</p><p>The fiery pain shot through the nerves, spine, and bones like lava coursing through in a rush, causing him to double over terribly. He gritted his teeth, trying to bear the pain, but it was unlike anything he had ever experienced. Not even the Dynasty’s training nor the imprisonment in his former life could inflict this much punishment on his body.</p><p>His arms felt the prick of a thousand needles inside every vein, capillary, and pore while his abdomen cramped up. He bent over as he rolled on the bed, his back beginning to sweat profusely and his head thumping with the sound of his accelerating heartbeat in his ear, overwhelming his senses.</p><p>It was painful just to breathe, forcing him to take short, measured breaths to withstand whatever was happening to his body. “GRRRRHHH!” Kyle grabbed a rolled-up piece of the blanket and clamped down hard on it, his hands gripping anything he could reach in sheer tension. </p><p>His body began to swell and contract in a grotesque fashion, as though something alien within was remodeling his body from within. It felt like a hot iron branding him from within, causing him to nearly cry out in pain. </p><p>As the pain continued, Kyle became more and more aware of something that felt foreign in his body, somehow integrated into the very fabric of his body. Too many effects and processes were happening internally, making it hard for him to focus on what was exactly happening, not to mention the mind-numbing pain. </p><p>Kyle had no idea how much time had passed until the pain finally subsided, allowing him to finally take a breather. His body felt exhausted, as though it had burned all his energy in a single instant. Kyle quickly activated the Necklace of Healing and drank the Stamina Potion without checking his stats. <em>Better be safe than sorry.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Class Obtained</strong></strong>: Crime Lord</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle didn’t bother checking the skills in-depth, immediately checking the time. It was almost nighttime now—the class integration had taken the entire day. His body was covered in sweat and blood, prompting him to take yet another shower.</p><p>He glanced at his face in the mirror, realizing his facial structure had slightly improved, with the former Alvin’s face being boosted with a charismatic effect. <em>What the hell is this interface?</em></p><p>The bed was soaking wet with sweat and bloodstains from his hands, so he got the room service to change it out. Keeping his belongings with him, he left the room while they cleaned up the place, heading down to the inn’s lobby for dinner.</p><p>This time, the inn was crowded, filled with many of the townsfolk. Kyle noticed the three merchants and the gruff driver were already in the same inn, telling stories about a monster attacking the forest bandits.</p><p>One of the merchant’s eyes landed on Kyle’s face for a brief moment before looking away and continuing to tell the story to enthralled listeners. <em>Is my face really that different, or did they just not pay much attention? Well, that saves me some trouble, at least. </em></p><p>Kyle found an empty table and sat down, peering at the menu that had been carved into a board above the bar. Ordering his meal, he glanced around the inn, listening in on some of the conversations happening around.</p><p>“Got shaken down again by Fred. Fuck man, he used to be an all right enforcer until the Sanctum of Yual sent one of their priests into town. Now he’s all righteous and holy, unwilling even to look the other way for even a moment. We used to drink in this town all day and night. Now? Not even a single drop!”</p><p>“Mate, my hands are already shaking from the lack of card games here. It’s only been a week, but I’m dying right now. Maybe I should just head and join the forest bandits.”</p><p>“You serious? After hearing about the monster that attacked them? What would Mary say? You can’t just leave her and the kids.”</p><p>“Bah, the three merchants are off their rockers. Fuck it, I’ll bring them all along. Maybe I’ll join the slave traders too when they make their next pass-through.”</p><p>“Don’t count on it. The next time they come around, Fred and his cronies will probably be all over it. A bust like that would be big on their record.”</p><p>“HAH! Fred won’t stand a chance against them guards. He barely swung a sword in his life!”</p><p><em>Looks like the prohibitions are being enforced in the neighboring towns too…</em> Kyle took note of the conversations in town, marking them in his head for future reference. If he wanted to establish a proper supply line of Euria Seeds, this town might have a big part to play in it. </p><p>Euria Seeds had yet to be deemed prohibited, so Kyle did not have to worry too much. However, seeing how the Sanctum of Yual was willing to ban many things outright, he was certain they would soon start banning Euria Seeds, especially with the way he was about to develop the business. </p><p>There was not much else going on, mostly just other people complaining about the enforcers moving into town. Kyle did not see any idea of a local mob or mafia existing yet. There was a chance for business here, but he could only do something once he got a better picture of the town and made some more connections. <em>Perhaps I could set up a few shell companies here to handle the trade of Euria Seeds.</em></p><p>He was also on a strict time limit, with the repayment of the debt coming up. For now, he decided to focus on finding the habitat of the Euria Seeds and the goblins who supposedly lived in the same area. </p><p>The next day, Kyle immediately left the inn as early as he could, continuously checking behind him for any tails or people watching. He was unsure if any of the city gangs had posted someone to watch over him, but he already knew that if the Violet Demons learned of him killing their forest bandits, he would have a problem.</p><p>Using a replica map bought from the town, he navigated his way through the dense forest, trudging through the foliage and dead leaves. He spotted a few animals, noticing that most of them were similar to those of Ancient Earth. Squirrels, deer, wild pigs, and rabbits were seemingly common here. He slightly expected a bit more of a fantasy twist, seeing as goblins were already around.</p><p>As he walked through the forest, a bloody stench soon wafted through the air, becoming stronger over time. It put him on guard, forcing him to keep his hammer at the ready, his eyes darting all over the tree branches to check for ambushes.</p><p>Pushing his way through a few dense bushes, he soon got a glimpse of the source of the smell. It seemed to be a mass grave of sorts, except the bodies were all fully decomposing and rotting, clear signs that they had died quite some time ago.</p><p>Three goblins were crouched over in the mass grave, sorting through the rotten human meat and limbs. They used their little green grubby hands to scoop something out of the meat, stuffing it into dirty pouches made of leather and skin patches, grunting at one another.</p><p>Kyle decided to hide and watch, seeing as the goblins did not notice him. The three goblins worked their way through the pit, scooping continuously. Soon, Kyle finally understood what they were doing. <em>They are harvesting the maggots from the decomposing meat as food. Interesting…</em></p><p>Suddenly, a loud, rickety sound could be heard, with the three goblins immediately scampering away toward the mountains. Kyle hid even more, lying low in the bushes as he spotted a wheelbarrow coming through a small path. It was two forest bandits, one escorting and one pushing two dead girls on the wheelbarrow.</p><p>They dumped the bodies into the mass grave pit, with one of the forest bandits peering over the edge. “Hey, look. Your former girl is doing pretty good.”</p><p>“Cheh. Thought she would have been reduced to bones by now. I guess the maggots and goblins don’t even like her. What a waste of rakels that one was.”</p><p>They didn’t converse anymore, simply heading back the same way. Kyle did not move at all, continuously observing his surroundings. He soon saw the three goblins reappear, obviously not having collected enough.</p><p>He paid more attention to their loadout this time. Each one was barely armored, with only a flint or stone knife hanging from a loose cloth belt. Only one of them had a decent metal knife, which seemed to serve as the only weapon they had.</p><p>When entering a new environment, observing how the locals worked was the best way to get the lay of the land the fastest. Kyle decided to follow the goblins back to the den before deciding on a course of action. <em>Maybe they can be the perfect underlings…</em><h1><a id="_r9cv5cv7rwsv"></a>Chapter 23: Mental Fatigue</h1></p><p><em>Three days later…</em></p><p>Kyle had the place mapped out for now. There was indeed a vast amount of Euria Seeds in the region. If he somehow managed to pick everything up, he could supply the city of Raktor with up to fifty times its current consumption each year, and that was just his estimate. Not even the plantations he had learned about from Damian could produce that much in a controlled environment.</p><p>The reason no one harvested much here was due to the constant threat of goblins. While the weaker ones were sent out to forage for food, the stronger ones remained in their dens and protected the nearby areas, which somehow corresponded with a dense concentration of Euria Trees. Kyle had already watched another human harvester get chased out of some of the denser Euria Tree habitats, which seemed to be considered sacred or protected by the goblins. </p><p>The stronger goblins had much better gear from former fallen adventurers and failed expeditions. Some goblins were even stronger than Kyle, although that was rare. </p><p>Kyle had located one goblin den nested in an abandoned mining shaft from decades ago, the tunnels leading into the mountain's base. It was well defended, with nearly twenty to thirty goblins patrolling the main entrance at all times. </p><p>Working his way around the mountain, he found a secondary entrance to the same mining tunnels, though it was much smaller and subsequently less defended as well. He only saw five goblins on guard duty at any given time, and they were significantly less defended. </p><p>Kyle knew they were not the only group or tribe of goblins in the area. There might be a dozen tribes or more, but the area was big, spanning hundreds of kilometers. Even if he attacked a den and the other tribes reacted, they would take too long to respond.</p><p>However, he had found no sign that the tribes were working together on good terms. On one occasion, he had seen five goblin guards immediately kill a stray goblin who seemed to have lost his way.</p><p>This consistent observation also triggered a few titles over the three days.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Tracker (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle had also found a small alcove nearby, a short walk away from the secondary entrance to the goblin’s den. He rested there, planning how he was going to tackle this issue. There was no way of starting a Euria Seeds harvesting business without clearing the goblin tribes.</p><p>Theoretically, he should have brought two dozen Seven Snakes members and had them sequentially wipe each tribe. However, that will draw far too many eyes, especially with the enforcers in the town watching his gang’s movements. <em>No doubt Sebastian and Wrent are also eyeing my members closely now for any anomalies.</em></p><p>Hiring adventurers to fight the goblins would create unnecessary attention. Other businessmen and merchants were also interested in harvesting the bountiful Euria Seeds but were currently blocked by the high cost of eliminating the goblins. Kyle would prefer if that natural barrier remained so as to enable him to quickly develop a monopoly.</p><p>However, there was one additional benefit Kyle had over the other merchants and businessmen—it wasn’t the first time he colonized a planet with local natives. If he was right, all the tactics he learned in the Galactic Era would work here easily as well. <em>If only I had my exosuit, I could have them revere me as a god. But let’s start with the basics first.</em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The same three goblins headed out to another part of the forest this time. They always sent out two groups to collect more food for the growing tribe. The tribe was always growing. This was how life was in Culdao Peaks.</p><p>They harvested fruits, dug up tubers, and sometimes pinched a few fungi, stuffing all of them into the same dirty pouches they had been using for generations. Some boasted a few newer pieces of equipment, seemingly homemade and of adequate quality.</p><p>Suddenly, one of the goblins spotted a rare sight that would make anyone in the den go crazy—a loaf of bread dropped on the ground.</p><p>Fresh.</p><p>The goblin pounced on it immediately, quickly eating half of it.</p><p>The other two saw it before immediately tussling and grappling the first goblin, trying to get a bite of the rare bread as well. Loud grunts and squeals echoed through the treeline as the three goblins fought over it.</p><p>A silent shadow loomed over them, perched on the tree branches. The moment the three goblins began to tire out from their fight, the shadow dropped, swinging a neon red arctech hammer and caving a goblin’s skull inward in a single downward swing. A follow up strike finished the goblin for good.</p><p>The remaining two goblins yelped, but before they could wield their knives, they were immediately kicked in quick succession, the wind knocked out of their chests. They did not stand a chance. </p><p>As night soon fell, a lone goblin guard in the den ran in to report to the shaman, who was the leader of the goblin tribe. Both groups sent out to forage for food did not return home. </p><p>The shaman frowned but did not think much of it. The forest was not exactly a safe place, and six goblins were hardly a dent in their numbers. The tribe had more than three hundred goblins. Goblins could already start working after two years of childhood, so the shaman was not bothered, simply sending the guard away.</p><p>The next day came and went, but the exact same thing happened. All three groups disappeared as well, never to return. Even the search parties sent to find their bodies were unsuccessful. The shaman was now slightly worried. </p><p>On the third day, the killings stopped. The forage groups were afraid to venture out but somehow did not encounter anything. The shaman was extremely confused now but decided to put the past two days behind him. He simply doubled the number of guards at the entrance as well as at the secondary entrance. </p><p>On the fourth day, the killing resumed. Search parties still failed to find the bodies, with one of the search parties never returning as well. The shaman ordered the forage groups to be beefed up, attaching two goblin warriors to each of them.</p><p>The killing didn’t stop on the fifth day, with the addition of the goblin warriors not doing anything. Now, the shaman was in full panic mode, unable to determine what was going on. The guards were still doubled, and the entire tribe was in a high-tension mode. By now, it had already lost more than two dozen goblins, along with a few trained warriors. Scouts were ordered everywhere in the forest, but they could not find anything.</p><p>On the sixth day, nothing happened. No killings, no sightings. </p><p>The pattern repeated, with the shaman unable to fix or remedy it. He could send out more troops, but that would leave the base more vulnerable. As the ninth day approached, the shaman immediately sent as many foraging groups as he could, following the pattern of no killing. </p><p>The doubled-up guards, who had been in high tension the entire week and doing continuous patrols, finally took a break, knowing that there would be no killing on this day. It was at this very moment of mental fatigue that Kyle began his attack. </p><p>The guards at the secondary entrance did not even see it coming, with Kyle activating his Aero Shoes and smashing their heads with terrifying precision. He quickly entered the mining tunnels, collapsing the structure and closing the entrance before leaving. </p><p>He then headed to the main entrance, where the number of guards had dropped significantly. The trained warriors were all taking a rest in the den itself, leaving only rookie goblins to defend the main entrance. It was a simple wooden barricade, with a few abandoned houses that used to store mining equipment or serve as dorms, along with a watch post. </p><p>Kyle noted there were a few goblin archers, but he had the crossbow from Orthon, along with twenty bolts loaded into the cartridge. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Ornate Repeater Crossbow (Intermediate)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>He sniped the archer at the top of the watch post with pinpoint precision, who could barely scream with a bolt stuck in its windpipe. </p><p>Moving quickly, he attacked the main entrance head-on, causing an alarm to be raised. The rookie goblins valiantly fended off Kyle, but he leapt and danced around their amateur swings, simply kicking them or using his hammer to parry their hits before cracking their limbs or bones. </p><p>After dealing with the guards, he could already hear the stronger warriors coming out from inside the den. Kyle immediately ran up to the mine shaft, collapsing only one of the beams in a controlled fashion. The initially large tunnel that could fit seven humans from end to end started to crumble, the rubble now allowing only one goblin to squeeze through at a time. </p><p>Kyle did not plan to fight all three hundred goblins simultaneously but rather reduce the number of opponents he had to face as much as possible. </p><p>The goblin warriors did not think too much, simply charging through the tunnel and running right at Kyle. The skill of the trained warriors was far better than expected, having fought adventurers and other tribes. Kyle had to focus more, practicing his combat skills in a continuous series of life-and-death duels.</p><p>The Necklace of Healing could not heal a wound fast enough during the battle itself, so Kyle placed more emphasis on avoiding wounds, parrying hits, and putting the full range of his former martial arts knowledge to the test. </p><p>He fought close to a dozen goblin warriors in a short ten minutes, killing all of them. The system messages for each kill were temporarily ignored by Kyle as he chugged a Stamina Potion and a Strength Potion to keep himself going.</p><p>An hour passed, the bodies of goblin warriors piling up next to him. Even the goblin warriors were starting to lose their original fervor, the previous mental fatigue catching up to them. They also realized that this human was the main culprit behind the killings, adding even more fear and intimidation. </p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar burst out from the tunnel, with the goblin warriors being shoved out of the way by a much larger goblin. Wielding a rusted battleaxe that was obviously stolen from an adventurer, the goblin was two heads taller than Kyle. Its green skin was adorned with tribal tattoos, and runes were carved into its face.</p><p>The rest of its body was covered in full metal plate armor like a knight, potentially the only complete heavy armor set that the goblin den had. The arm had a vambrace that was noticeably arctech equipment, built completely differently from the rest of the armor set. It had green arcing lines along the length, making Kyle wary about its effects. </p><p>The two stared at one another as the goblin warriors, still cramped in the tunnels, watched on in fear. Even some of the forage groups who heard the fighting did not dare to try and backstab Kyle. </p><p>“Human!” the goblin champion suddenly yelled, shocking Kyle. “You, die, here!” It spat on the ground and gripped its battleaxe with both hands, ready to duel. </p><p>Kyle didn’t respond, immediately wielding his crossbow pistol and firing three bolts at the champion’s head. Instead of being afraid, the vambrace began to glow brighter, before three energy bolts suddenly shot out, hitting the crossbow bolts and deflecting them away.</p><p><em>Point Defense?!</em> Kyle was surprised at the appearance of the engraving and caught off-guard as the champion charged with the battleaxe, performing a deadly horizontal swing that almost nicked Kyle as he leapt backward. </p><p>With the Aero Shoes, Kyle sprinted forward slightly faster, using his hammer to bash the armor plate of the goblin as he was still swinging. The hammer instead bounced off, unable to do any damage. <em>I need more power! Penchant for Violence!</em></p><p>The skill activated, giving him a boost in combat stats. His body suddenly roared with a surging force from deep within, as though he had unlocked some small hidden potential in his body. The strength increase was significant enough for Kyle to feel as though the hammer was close to a tenth lighter.</p><p>He flanked the goblin as the momentum carried him around, just as the goblin was about to swing downward in a counterattack. With speed as his advantage, he delivered a kick against the goblin’s shin, causing it to kneel. Kyle slightly winced in pain from kicking a full metal plate, but he gritted his teeth and continued fighting, narrowly dodging a right hook from the goblin. </p><p>Kyle was about to lift his hammer to strike, but the champion’s vambrace activated again, sending a bolt toward the hammer and sending Kyle slightly off balance. The unexpected use of the vambrace caught him off guard, allowing the goblin to recover and swing the battleaxe again, forcing Kyle to duck and avoid it.</p><p>With a decisive blow, Kyle delivered a straight right uppercut into the groin of the champion, causing its eyes to bulge. Kyle took advantage and punched the goblin’s face three times in rapid succession, toppling it over.</p><p>Suddenly, the tribal tattoo on the goblin’s face glowed green, a healing aura working through the body. <em>What?!</em> Kyle was not about to let him heal right in front of him, grabbing his hammer again and pummeling the goblin in the face with as many strikes as he could manage.</p><p>Despite the green aura, the goblin’s face soon became a bloodied mess of meat and flesh. The rune was disfigured now, breaking the healing aura and killing the champion. </p><p>Kyle heaved as he stood up, his face and arms bloodied from the splatter. He glanced at the remaining goblin warriors, all of whom were now shivering in fear. Their champion had been killed in less than a few minutes, so what hope was there against this human?</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Goblin Killer (Basic)</p>
