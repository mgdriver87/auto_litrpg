<p></p><p>Chapter 24: Uplift Procedure</p><p>Kyle had to kill off a few more brave goblin warriors before they finally relented, recognizing Kyle’s domineering strength. He knew he would not be able to win against all three hundred, so the method of skimming their forces slowly and funneling them through a single cramped entrance worked perfectly. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. </p><p>The goblin warriors and the forage groups all dropped their weapons in surrender, hoping to appeal to the human’s morality, if any. Some tried to get a sneak attack as Kyle approached to collect their weapons, but were always immediately killed by Kyle, further driving fear into their hearts. </p><p>He picked up the vambrace of the goblin, patting away some of the meat and flesh and putting it on. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Projectile Defense Vambrace (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle rounded up the surrendering goblins at the mine entrance, tying some of them up with rope left in the storage huts. Soon, a goblin shaman appeared, escorted by warriors. The shaman was small, frail, and sickly, but Kyle could see the same runes that were on the champion carved everywhere on the shaman’s visible parts.</p><p>“Human! For what purpose do you slaughter us?” The goblin shaman spoke with surprising clarity and some mastery of the human language, though it was accompanied by a low, guttural accent and obviously broken grammar.</p><p>“I’d like to negotiate the purchase of the tribe.”</p><p>“Pur-chase? Money? The tribe is worth far more than your trinkets,” the goblin shaman scoffed.</p><p>“You’re in no position to take such a stance.”</p><p>“The tribe is three hundred goblins strong!”</p><p>“And also must have the elderly, sick, and young still hiding in the den. You do not have three hundred <em>warriors</em>. I estimate close to fifty of your best warriors have died at my hands over the last week.”</p><p>“Means human should pay reparations! For grievances! You have yet to defeat our champion!” The shaman was not budging.</p><p>“You mean this guy?” Kyle motioned to the body of the champion he had pummeled to death, causing the shaman to yelp in surprise and calm itself down.</p><p>The shaman did not immediately reply, opting for a quick chat with the warriors around it instead. Kyle could somehow pick out a few words thanks to his title, allowing him to understand a bit of what was being said.</p><p>&lt;…  strong… ambush? ...too strong… want.&gt;</p><p>The goblins finally finished their discussion. Clearing its throat it reassumed its position. However, before it could speak, Kyle aimed his crossbow and fired bolts at two of the warriors next to the shaman, the bolts piercing their eyes and killing them instantly. </p><p>“This is taking too long, and I decided you’re not worth the price. You will now all answer to me.” Kyle spoke with a domineering attitude, triggering his new skill, Intimidation Aura, as well. </p><p>The sudden switch from negotiation to violence shocked the shaman, curtailing its defiant stance and forcing it to submit lest more of its kind be slaughtered. It was how self-preservation worked in the forest—the law of the jungle. The remaining goblin warriors immediately bowed along with the shaman, groveling on the floor. </p><p>Kyle did not even flinch nor hesitate when killing the warriors. For him, violence was a given, something he could do at a drop of a hat if there were no repercussions. Based on his former experience, violence and show of strength was the best way to initially pacify a native population. The rebellions would come later, but Kyle had that all sorted out as well. </p><p>“You, name.” Kyle pointed his crossbow at the goblin shaman.</p><p>“Gulak, at your service!” the goblin shaman replied quickly. </p><p>“Gulak. Show me around the goblin den.” </p><p>“Y-Yes!” Gulak immediately got up, clearing a path for Kyle to walk through the still-groveling goblin warriors. They escorted him down the mining tunnels, winding paths of forks and dead ends. </p><p>The goblin warriors whispered to each other as they walked, with Gulak continuously giving hand signs as though it was fidgeting with its hands. Kyle pretended not to see it, instead focusing on the abandoned mining equipment as he listened in on the whispers of the goblins behind him. </p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Goblin Observer (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Entering the den of a goblin tribe alone is quite a feat</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> +10 DEX, +50% success at learning goblin language.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The improved title allowed him to pick up a few words from the whispers. &lt;…ambush… dead end… plunder…&gt;</p><p>The tunnels were barely illuminated, save for the glow of some mushrooms and unknown jewels embedded in the walls, with former mining lanterns lit up intermittently between passages. Gulak kept making turns and leading Kyle down, all the while the number of goblin warriors and archers behind Kyle began to increase.</p><p>They soon reached a dead end, with Gulak turning around with a wide grin. The runes on its body began to glow white, a sort of hazy optical illusion slowly masking the shaman from view from the legs up.</p><p>Gulak smirked. “Human, today you—” A swift hammer uppercut knocked its chin upward, stopping the optical illusion and sending him flying into the air before crashing into the side of the tunnel’s wall. Kyle was already more than prepared but was slightly surprised at the effect. <em>Optical Illusion technology? It’s not as advanced as it should be, but arcia is really amazing.</em></p><p>The archers launched a few arrows at Kyle, prompting him to activate the armguard he had taken from the champion, allowing him to block them with green energy bolts lancing out and deflecting them. Activating Penchant for Violence again, he rushed at the throng of goblin warriors, swinging wildly with his full strength. </p><p>He bashed through the warriors in the tunnel, sometimes even using their bodies as shields and ramming them against the warriors themselves, causing them to tumble over. Kyle methodically killed each and every goblin warrior involved in the ambush. The battle lasted for nearly five minutes.</p><p>Gulak finally came to its senses, only seeing the bloodied Kyle standing in front of it and the bodies of its brethren behind him. “Looks like you don’t understand yet.” Kyle grabbed the goblin shaman’s neck and lifted it up, causing its legs to dangle as it tried to scratch Kyle’s arms off. “I am the master of this tribe now. Your warriors are all dead. Do you still wish to resist?”</p><p>“N-N-No! I will submit!” Gulak relented, struggling against the iron grip of Kyle. It now realized that Kyle could understand goblin language to a certain degree, which was the only reason it could think of as to why Kyle knew about the ambush.</p><p>“Good.” Kyle dropped Gulak to the floor. It gasped for air as it massaged its almost crushed neck. “Gather all remaining goblins in your largest common area. You will be the translator.”</p><p>Half an hour later, close to two hundred goblins were all gathered in a large cavernous area, their common dining area. Gulak stood on a makeshift stage from turned-over mining carts and crates, clearing his throat. </p><p>The goblins were all murmuring with each other, staring at Kyle with curiosity and wariness. Many of them have not left the den before but have heard stories of evil humans who killed goblins for fun. </p><p>Kyle’s mouth began to move, speaking to Gulak while he translated to the goblins. “Fellow tribesmen, today is a good day! A human hero has arrived and has quelled the monster who had been killing our warriors over the last week. While we have lost many of them in the fight, this human here has saved us in our time of need. With our tribe left vulnerable, this human will help defend our den from rival tribes and other creatures of the forest.”</p><p>The goblins were all stunned. A human helping goblins?</p><p>“The human has offered to provide us with food, technology, and equipment as well. I have agreed to this deal in my capacity as a shaman.”</p><p>The crowd of goblins didn’t cheer, but they didn’t react adversely either. They weren’t too smart, unable to understand the implications of such a favor. Kyle estimated the intelligence of most of them to be that of an eight- to twelve-year-old kid, which was just right for the next part of his plan. </p><p>Gulak dismissed the crowd, gathering the smartest goblins in a group to meet Kyle. There were only three of them: Gulak, Gringer, and Gobalt. All of these three knew the truth about what Kyle had done and were now completely subservient to him until they found a way to beat or eradicate him. <em>We just have to wait until the goblin king sends their regular envoy to collect tribute, and then we shall receive their assistance!</em></p><p>Kyle observed the crowd of goblins dispersing. After he eliminated most of the warriors, only the elderly and the young were left behind. <em>The elderly are of no issue, but for the longevity of this operation, subverting the young is necessary. </em></p><p>“This tribe now falls under me. I will have all goblins work to harvest Euria Seeds.” Kyle showed them an example of the seed. </p><p>“This… This is a sacred fruit that only the shamans can touch when performing the rituals. Having the uneducated goblins touch them is sacrilege.” Gulak couldn’t help speaking out. Decades of tribal traditions were ingrained into their brains.</p><p>Kyle simply had to rest his hand on the hilt of his hammer and Gulak zipped its own mouth, no longer speaking back. “How many able-bodied goblins do we have left?”</p><p><em>You killed our warriors, and you’re asking us this?</em> “Fifty able-bodied goblins remain, though they are not trained to fight. It would have been much more before.” Gringer was in charge of the warriors, bowing respectfully with a tinge of hatred in his voice.</p><p>Kyle ignored the veiled jab, looking toward Gobalt, who was in charge of the logistics of the tribe. “Food supplies?”</p><p>“Dwindling. Only enough to last two weeks.” <em>Because of your filthy actions, human. </em></p><p>“That’s good enough. From today on, I will train all fifty warriors in a different fighting style. Gather all the weapons from the main entrance and bring them here.” Kyle ordered.</p><p>The fifty warriors soon lined up in front of him, trembling slightly as he walked through and inspected their bodies. While Gulak had claimed that the human hero was here to protect them, they couldn’t help feeling like they were being sold as a product. Some of them were well aware that this human was the <em>monster</em> that had been killing them, instilling even more fear in them.</p><p>Gringer translated as Kyle spoke. “All of you will be trained as archers from now on. The training routine will be tree climbing, marksmanship with bows, and knife combat.”</p><p>The goblins all immediately went into a frenzy, with Gringer turning to glare at Kyle. “Tree climbing is for shitty elves, not us! We are better!” Gringer spat with derision, as did many of the newly trained warriors. </p><p>Kyle suddenly stood up, speaking in the goblin language. &lt;Who can defeat me? Come forward.&gt;</p><p>The warriors all froze. They did not know the truth about Kyle killing their warriors, but they had heard the story from Gulak that Kyle killed a monster that one hundred of their warriors could not. </p><p>Gringer himself did not dare fight Kyle. If the champion could not defend him, who could?</p><p>“Then the training routine is settled.” Kyle began to order the dilution of the highly concentrated stamina potions he had brought along in his backpack. “Do not drink until I tell you to. Anyone who does not follow the order will not receive another.”</p><p>The next day, the training began in earnest. The goblins were much more physically inclined than the humans, but their shorter stature limited the range of combat styles Kyle could teach them. Kyle instructed them on how to use the trees for cover, leaping from branch to branch and taking advantage of their low weight and small figure to avoid retaliation. </p><p>He had them run mock battles against each other through the forest, honing their marksmanship and combat skills. The warriors soon began to see how effective the fighting style was, which was much different from their usual blunt and head-on battles with other tribes. </p><p>A week passed under Kyle’s intensive training. They trained day and night, not requiring muscle rest due to the stamina recovery options provided. Kyle had brought highly concentrated potions before diluting them with water and passing them out. This meant they managed to clock in close to eight to twelve hours of training each day.</p><p>They weren’t expert fighters by the end of the week, but they were competent enough that three of them could give any normal human a run for their money. Kyle was satisfied with the result but was soon confronted by Gobalt. “Human! We only have enough food for a week!”</p><p>Kyle took out his map of the forest, where a big red circle marked the location that Orthon, the forest bandit, had told him previously. “Don’t worry, our food supply is right here.”<br /><br /></p><p>Chapter 25: Raiding A Fort</p><p>Paulie roared as he drove a cleaver into the wooden table, causing the cutlery to jump. The two forest bandits standing in front of him shivered slightly as the large man leaned back, the veins of fury clearly visible on his face. </p><p>The slaves to his left and right were not bothered at all, remaining completely still and silent as Paulie cursed and swore with every phrase he could find in his limited vocabulary. </p><p>“You’re telling me that after three whole weeks of searching far and wide, you can’t find a single hair or tail of the guy that killed Orthon and Troy?! ARE YOU EVEN A FOREST BANDIT?!” Paulie bellowed, chucking a glass against the wall, which shattered brilliantly. A few of the glass pieces rebounded and cut into a slave’s skin, but she did not move a single inch, remaining passive. </p><p>“Boss, we really tried! The closest we could get to was Kris Grayborn, but the only thing we found was his bloodied cloak. No one in town seems to have heard of the guy before!”</p><p>“What about the three merchants who were with them? The driver?”</p><p>“They are all dead. They swore they did not know anything even under torture. I’m telling you, I think the rumors of it being a monster are—”</p><p>“SHUT UP! You know there is no such monster in the forest. WE are the monsters of the forest. The goblins, including their ‘king’, tremble at the sight of us!” Paulie slammed the table. He fumed for a while, before dismissing the two guys and pondering quietly. </p><p>Paulie wasn’t an independent boss—most of his work and hijacking happened because of information given by the Violet Demons in the West Sector of Raktor. He would receive a cargo list, and his boys would be posted on it as guards. The stick-up was supposed to be plain and simple: money or their lives, and usually, the former was chosen. </p><p>Sometimes the drivers would be more than happy to “give up” the cargo: they got a cut from the Violet Demons directly, and their employer wouldn’t be able to blame the drivers for the loss. It was an easy business, but having four of his men killed in what was supposed to be a simple nab and grab left a sour taste in Paulie’s mouth. </p><p><em>Is it the Veiled Angels pulling a fast one on us? Or are the new inquisitors in town trying to get the two of us to clash harder</em>? “You, bring me another glass,” Paulie ordered one of the slaves. He frowned and tried to consolidate the evidence he had now. Was the heat finally catching up to him?</p><p>Frustrated, he grabbed the new glass of mead served by the slave, drinking it down in one swift motion. The glass was already slightly jagged, cutting his lips slightly. “FUCK!” Paulie raged and slammed the glass onto the slave’s head, knocking her out onto the ground with a loud crack. Blood began to pool on the floor, but the remaining slaves didn’t react. </p><p>“You three, grab the body, clean, and dump.” </p><p>The slaves complied, hauling the dead body out of the room while another slave desperately tried to mop up the dripping blood stains. “Fucking useless idiots, why did I even agree to buy you all from Vin? I should rough him up the next time his slave caravans come around.”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud bell could be heard ringing through the base. “What?! What’s going on?” Paulie demanded, with the slaves all shaking their heads in response. The bell was meant for an enemy attack, but it had not been rung in the five years they had been in operation. </p><p>Scrambling outside, Paulie could only see the dead bodies of watchtower scouts falling to the ground, three arrows lodged in their necks while their faces were frozen in shock. “Wh-Who is attacking us?!”</p><p>“I don’t know, but they are hitting us from the treeline!” One of the bandits at the top of the wooden walls that surrounded the forest bandit’s base reported down to Paulie before an arrow went straight through the bandit’s head, killing him instantly. </p><p>“GET TO COVER!” Paulie roared, running back into the room as a barrage of arrows flew over the walls, hitting indiscriminately. It was random, but the arrows lodged themselves everywhere—the storage sheds, the walls of houses. One even made it through the windows of Paulie’s house. He observed the arrow, noticing it was shoddily made, but its arrowhead was extremely sharp. <em>Goblins? But why?</em></p><p>He quickly grabbed his armor set, crossbow, and sword. The remaining forest bandits were no slouches either, quickly responding to the deaths of their comrades and firing back into the treelines. </p><p>A few goblins were hit, their bodies now visible to the forest bandits. “What? Why are the goblins attacking us, and since when were they so good at using a bow?”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. They are all stinking rats anyway. Gear up the point defense engravings - Let’s show them who’s the boss of the forest!” Paulie galvanized his men with a rousing shout, leading the counterattack as he climbed up the walls, firing back with precision, killing a goblin with each bolt. </p><p>The bandits’ point defense engravings proved useful, but were easily overwhelmed by the sheer number of arrows that the goblins shot at them, as though they were prepared for it.</p><p>Another loud bang drew Paulie out of his momentum, causing him to turn and see a lone human at the wooden gate, which had been smashed apart by a series of hammer strikes. The man wore a cloak, but his back clearly had the ornate crossbow that Orthon used to have. <em>It’s him!</em></p><p>Paulie slapped the shoulders of the two closest guys. “Get that man! He’s the one inciting the goblin attack!” Five forest bandits were already aiming at him, an indiscriminate barrage of arrows following shortly after.</p><p>The man lifted his vambrace, green energy bolts flying out and deflecting the incoming arrows. Behind him, more than two dozen goblins wielding bows and swords rushed into the fort, climbing the walls and engaging the forest bandits in close combat. </p><p>With the goblin archers shooting from the top of the trees and the goblin warriors attacking from within, the forest bandits were pincered, forced to defend from the side and from the front as well. Paulie immediately recognized he was about to lose this fight, quickly grabbing one of the forest bandits and using him as a shield, as his body soon became a pincushion for arrows. </p><p>He ran back into his house, scrambling for his secret stash. <em>I need to get out of here. If the Veiled Angels catch me, it will be all over!</em> “You four, go block that door for me!”</p><p>The slaves followed the order, quickly carrying the furniture over to the door and barricading the door. Screams and shouts echoed in from outside as the remaining forest bandits began to waver, trying to flee. </p><p>Paulie soon managed to dig out his secret stash from under the floorboards, grabbing everything valuable, when a cloaked man jumped in through the windows all of a sudden. Paulie grimaced before waving wildly at the slaves. “What are all of you doing?! Kill that man!” <em>If he’s here to rescue the slaves, he will never hurt them. This is my chance!</em></p><p>The four female slaves grabbed anything that could act as a weapon nearby, charging at the cloaked man. Without a single breath of hesitation, the cloaked man wielded his hammer and immediately hit the front two slaves right on the head, killing them instantly, while using his free arm to punch the third in the face and sending her sprawling. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Female Slave, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p>Paulie now knew he was done for—a true killer had arrived. </p><p>“Wait, wait, wait! We can talk this out! What do you want? Are you an overseer of the Violet Demons? I’ve been following up on every payment! I’ve paid all my dues on time!” Paulie desperately waved with one hand, while his other hand reached for a sword on his waist. </p><p>“We can talk this out, right? Look, I’m open to switching sides. Veiled Angels? Ardent Cretins? Uhm… Ilysian Punks? No problem, I’ll even take a lower cut!” Paulie tried to buy time as he inched closer to the back of the house, trying to feel the floor with his foot. </p><p>The cloaked man continued walking briskly toward him, his hammer on his right and crossbow pistol on the left. As he walked into attacking range, Paulie grinned and lunged forward with his sword drawn, charging with a forward stab. </p><p><em>This is My Turf.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Skill</strong></strong>: This is My Turf (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Paulie continued charging when he was suddenly forced back by an unknown force field that appeared around the cloaked man, seemingly out of nowhere. </p><p>Paulie got up and tried to swing at the man, his sword bouncing off the invisible force field that seemed to extend three meters in a radius around the cloaked man. “What the fuck?!” Paulie swung desperately, his sword continuously being deflected off as the cloaked man walked closer and closer to him.</p><p>“Who the fuck are you?! What do you want?! Money?!” Paulie backpedaled, his back against the wall now as he held the sword in front with both hands. The cloaked man never stopped walking, continuously moving toward Paulie. </p><p>The force field began to touch the sword, the sheer resistance forcing Paulie to drop the sword as the skin on his palm was nearly shredded from the resulting friction. The invisible wall began to push up against Paulie, making him unable to move as he was pinned against the wall. The armor on his body began to creak as the cloaked man inched ever closer, as though he were trying to crush Paulie with all his might by simply stepping forward.</p><p>“Please, stop! I’ll give you everything you want! Jus—ARRRGHHH.” The cloaked man walked even closer, the force field squashing Paulie into the wall. The cloaked man also began to feel resistance from the force field, like he was pushing a steel block. He pushed forward, his feet cracking against the wooden planks in the ground and causing splinters to fly in all directions.</p><p>As he took the second and third steps, the flesh was compacted, and the skeletal structure of Paulie snapped, twisted, and deformed beyond its stress limit. </p><p>The skill effect ended, causing Paulie’s body to drop to the ground, blood oozing out of every orifice. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Forest Bandit Leader Paulie, +400 EXP</p><p></p><p>Kyle smiled to himself as he picked up the secret stash, wiping the blood off its wooden surface. <em>The skill would be pretty good if it did not have a three-hour cooldown. </em></p><p><em> </em>The sounds of screaming and fighting soon came to a halt outside. Kyle left Paulie’s body in the house, returning outside where Gringer waited for him. “Sir, we have secured the fort!” </p><p>“Good. Call the others to transport all the food, equipment, and all the human slaves back to the den. Use the wheelbarrows the forest bandits have. If there isn’t enough, make new ones.”</p><p>“Yes, sir! Shall the human slaves be thrown into a mass grave too?” Gringer asked excitedly, obviously expecting some more juicy maggots. </p><p>“No, I have other plans for them. Have them all shifted to the underground caverns.”</p><p>The disappointed Gringer moved as ordered, getting the remaining thirty-eight goblin warriors and archers to haul the food back. It took a few hours, but soon the entire fort had been picked clean, with Kyle nodding in satisfaction. <em>Given the right training and command structure, goblins can be quite an effective workforce. </em></p><p>Returning to the goblin den, Kyle suddenly asked Gulak for a one-on-one meeting. “Human! What is the meaning of all these human slaves? How can we feed more than fifty of them!?”</p><p>“Not important. And we have all the food stolen from the forest bandit.” Kyle dismissed his concerns, his eyes drawn toward the goblin’s runic tattoos on its body instead. He recalled how Gulak had attempted to disguise himself. <em>Weird. Now that I think about it, these are arcia engravings, are they not?</em></p><p>Gulak instinctively shuddered. “No, I am not female! No breeding!”</p><p>Kyle’s face twitched slightly before he calmed himself down. “I’m interested in your tattoos. You can activate them like arcia engravings?” He recalled the goblin champion healing himself.</p><p>“You are human; this is a goblin’s secret. Not allowed to tell!” Gulak crossed its arms, to which Kyle suddenly grabbed his hammer, about to smack its head in. “Wait! I’ll tell!”</p><p>Gulak led him to a ritualistic chamber only approved for shamans and shamans-in-training. The ceiling was riddled with twine, from which hung countless pig skins someone had carved on. Kyle noted that each of them was a specific skill engraving, which he assumed was what the shamans learned from. </p><p>A unique smell suddenly assaulted Kyle’s nose, reminding him of the arcia fuel packs he had seen in action around Raktor. </p><p>The chamber was filled with arcite embedded into the walls, and some of it had already been sapped of all its liquid arcia fuel. Kyle never expected the goblins to have access to such a vein of arcite. It was small, but still something valuable. </p><p>He was still weighing whether to monetize it or not when Gulak pointed to a ritual knife engraved with enchantments, too. Picking it up, the knife was extremely heavy, but obviously not made by goblins. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Taboo Knife (Intermediate)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A goblin heirloom from the past, designed for tattooing enchantments onto the skin.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Age undetermined.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>“Only goblins with achievements can receive the sacred symbols.” Gulak motioned to his hands, which were adorned with tattoos. “Any lesser goblin would faint or die from the pain.”</p><p><em>I was under the impression that engravings only worked on objects. </em>Kyle’s eyes lit up. He had a previous plan for the human slaves, but that was no longer necessary. The sinister expression on Kyle’s face frightened Gulak once more, reminding it of its previous experience.</p><p>“Does this work on humans?”</p><p>Chapter 26: Secret Agents</p><p>Sasha’s stomach rumbled as she tried to recall where she was. She did not see any of the same bars and cages that held her for what seemed like ages. Instead, all she saw was a small cavern with a simple stool and nothing else.</p><p>She lay in a small, comfortable bed made out of fur before a dull, aching pain seared through her, stemming from her hand. She raised her right hand to reveal a bandage, soaked in blood and another type of liquid, slowly oozing onto the forearm. <em>Another type of punishment?</em></p><p>Sasha was used to the beatings from the forest bandits. She had been in slavery for more than twelve years now, her entire town enslaved by greedy slave traders. She could recall Vin’s face full of greed when they stuffed her in a sack and gassed her to sleep for days.</p><p>Paulie’s face was still vivid in her memory, as he raped her time and time again, even when she was underage. Now, at the age of twenty, her face no longer bore the joy she once had.</p><p>Her days were filled with combat, as she was continuously used as target practice by the forest bandits, forced to dodge arrows or withstand sword blows. In the hope of getting stronger, she would sneak into the weapon storage or training yard, fiddling with the weapons and learning how to handle them. She managed to do it undetected for a year before she was caught.</p><p>Strong emotions had faded into nothingness over the years, and despair and hopelessness soon filled the void. Even the other slaves were of no comfort to her, fighting with her for survival and favoritism from the forest bandits. Every day was a struggle—no one was her friend or willing to help her. With a lack of proper food and no weapons, she was unable to defend herself nor support the muscle mass needed to fight effectively.</p><p><em>Strangely, my stomach no longer feels hungry. And my stamina seems to have recovered…</em></p><p>As Sasha moved, her right hand throbbed with pain, causing her to scream. However, only a weird guttural sound came out, which helped her quickly remember why she was one of the forest bandit’s favorites: she was mute. Her vocal cords were damaged, rendering her unable to talk back or scream. </p><p>However, no one responded to the weird sound as she was alone in the cavern. Loud footsteps could soon be heard coming down the hallway, with Sasha instinctively curling up into a defensive ball and hiding from view as far away in a corner as possible. </p><p>Soon, the owner of the footsteps was visible—it was a goblin. It sighed as it walked through the main corridor connecting the hundreds of small cavern rooms, poking its head inside and glancing at Sasha. </p><p>The girl immediately tensed up, but the goblin did not do anything, instead walking back briskly to wherever he came from. <em>Oh no! It’s going back to call the others! I have to escape. </em></p><p>The only thing she knew about goblins was that they thrived off the dead bodies of humans, having had former slave friends sent to the mass pits to die. </p><p>She peeked around the corner of the cavern, noticing that the patrolling goblin had long left. The room opposite was empty, leaving Sasha curious as to why there were so many rooms as she continued checking them. Some of them seemed to be inhabited by goblins before, with clear signs of their habitation lying around in the form of goblin clothing and even some rudimentary toys. </p><p><em>I’m staying in a goblin room? But why?</em> Sasha began to worry even more about what was happening to her, checking each room. Somehow every room was devoid of people or even goblins, frightening her even more. </p><p>As she passed a room, an arm suddenly reached out and grabbed her, causing her to flinch and react violently, nearly punching the person. However, she stopped, realizing that it was one of the other slaves she knew—Ciel.</p><p>They weren’t particularly close—no one was to Sasha. The man had, on a few occasions, joined other slaves in beating her up, stealing her food, and even raping her. Sasha had always borne a grudge for that.</p><p>However, Ciel did not take note of Sasha’s angry expression, instead putting a finger on his hand and hushing her. “Stay quiet and don’t make a sound! The goblins are hunting us. I know where the exit is, so follow me!”</p><p>Before Sasha could protest, Ciel ran off, motioning for Sasha to follow him. The two of them ran down a long hallway, subsequently turning a corner, expecting to see an exit. Instead, a handsome man with a dominating presence was standing in front of them, smiling. </p><p>“Where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>Sasha and Ciel were startled, but they immediately ran in the opposite direction. Surprisingly, the man did not give chase, simply standing there and watching them run off. Sasha found the man’s behavior odd until she saw a dozen goblins holding nets moving past the man, obviously aiming to capture them. </p><p>With the man blocking off what seemed like the exit, they had no choice but to run deeper into the corridor of rooms. They soon hit a fork, with both of them instinctively splitting up, forcing the chasing goblins to divide their forces too. </p><p>Sasha kept running, her head glancing into each of the rooms until she found what she was looking for and dashed in. The six goblins chasing her immediately surrounded the room, only to peek inside and see nothing. </p><p>The goblins chattered among themselves, preparing to give chase. But just as they were about to move off, a figure dropped from the ceiling of the room, her fingertips covered in blood from clinging onto random nocks in the cavern. She quickly tackled one of the goblins, grappling it to the ground and twisting its neck in one swift motion. </p><p>She then grabbed the knife from the dead goblin’s belt, pointing it toward the five net-holding goblins, who were slowly inching toward her. The net was soon thrown, but Sasha quickly dodged it by leaping backward. Leaping off the wall around the net, she lunged with the knife in front of her, plunging it into the chest of a goblin. </p><p>Not even trying to retrieve it, she quickly punched and kicked her way through the goblins, nailing all of them in a single hit. Soon, the five remaining goblins were either dead or squirming on the floor. But to her surprise, instead of more footsteps, she could see the sound of clapping from behind.</p><p>The girl spun and threw a knife at the source of the clapping, only to see the man catch it by the handle with his bare hands. “Impressive. Much better than the young man.”</p><p>Sasha turned and began to run again when the man suddenly lunged and grabbed her by the shoulder, twisting her into an arm lock and dragging her with him. The man brought her out of the corridor into a wider area, where there were already six of her former colleagues waiting for her, including Ciel, who was sitting there quietly eating a piece of bread. Each of them had a similar bandage on their hand.</p><p>Instead of a joyous reunion, they all stared at Sasha awkwardly, their gazes avoiding her as they continued to talk among themselves. “Ciel, you told me she died to the goblins!” one of them whispered angrily.</p><p>“I didn’t!” Ciel desperately tried to deny that, but his eyes told a different story. Sasha had long been used to such gossip behind her back, with her being the black sheep among the slaves. The main reason was that she was hard to talk to, and no one knew how to communicate with her. Sasha did not know how to read or write either, making things even worse. </p><p>However, her condition only emboldened other slaves to bully her even more, sure that she would never be able to speak the truth. She had been the target for venting anger countless times, a dummy to beat up so the slaves could feel better about themselves. Even after learning how to fight, there was no way she could fend off an entire group of slaves unarmed. </p><p><em>Weak, I’m too weak! From one slave master to another, only to be bullied by others!</em> Sasha raged inwardly, but her face remained calm, heading to a corner and sitting down far away from the other slaves. </p><p>“How could she die to the goblins? The goblins were not intended to kill you, but to test you. Sasha is the only one who managed to kill a goblin. Well done.” The man praised the girl, observing the reaction of the surprised slaves and Sasha, who was in pure shock. It was the first words of praise she had heard since she was enslaved. </p><p>“All six of you are what remains of the forest fort. All the other slaves are dead, either used as shields and bait, or due to collateral damage.”</p><p>Ciel’s heart clenched, knowing that the friends he had made over the years were mostly dead. The six slaves silently wept for a brief moment, but swiftly recovered their bearings. Death was always a moment’s notice away in the life of a slave, but they never expected them to die just inches away from freedom. Some cried for their parents, who were enslaved with them, and others cried for their friends. </p><p>Sasha did not cry or weep. All of the slaves had been dead to her for a long time. Instead, she felt some sort of satisfaction, knowing that those who had hurt her, indirectly or directly, had finally gotten their due. <em>Except the six of them.</em></p><p>The furious gaze from Sasha’s eyes did not escape the man’s notice. “Follow me.” He beckoned to the seven slaves including Sasha, who complied on reflex and immediately got to their feet. They had spent far too long in slavery.</p><p>The man led them to what seemed to be the main exit of the mine, showing them the patrolling goblins and a few of the green monsters training with bows and swords within a barricaded wooden fort. Most of the armor they were wearing was clearly from the forest fort. </p><p>“I am the one who saved you all, and you now have a choice. Walk out the gates, and you will be free. There will be no more debts to settle between us.”</p><p>Ciel and the six slaves’ faces lit up at the sound of freedom, but Sasha’s face remained downtrodden. She knew perfectly well that she was a long way from home—if her village even existed. Being mute and weak would only have her captured by other bandits or slavers within a week. </p><p>“Second option: Work with me, and I will train you to be strong. Everything you need to live will be provided, but the training will not be easy. You will follow my every command, but I promise no one will ever look down on you again. You will be trained to overpower everyone you meet.”</p><p>Sasha’s face brightened tremendously, but she quickly noticed the souring faces of the other six. </p><p>“You’re offering us enslavement? Right after you freed us? Are you crazy?” Ciel spat angrily, with the others nodding in agreement.</p><p>“It’s your choice. No one is forcing you either way, but you have two minutes to make that choice.”</p><p>Ciel quickly grabbed the rest into a huddle, including Sasha. “I think we can make it out. The town isn’t that far from here. I’ve been on a grocery run before. I can get us there, but we will need to make sure we can fend other goblins. Even if this man has them under control here, there are more tribes nearby.”</p><p>The man interrupted. “I will provide you a basic weapon to defend yourself with.” </p><p>Ciel bowed in thanks before continuing to explain. “If we work together as a team, we can fight off anything. We just need to fight for a day or so, and then we’ll be in town. Then we can go our separate ways. Maybe even stick together to make something for ourselves. What do you say?”</p><p>His optimism influenced the other five, who excitedly agreed, already having dreams of freedom beyond the forest. Some wanted to return to their homeland;, others were hoping to strike it rich on their own. None of them wanted to follow the command of the man, which only reminded them of their slave life. </p><p>However, Sasha broke free of the huddle, walking over to the man and standing next to him. To her, freedom without strength would only end up in slavery again. She had personally witnessed the man’s strength and wanted to be as strong as him—no, even stronger. Anything that could help her take this next step, she would grab. </p><p>Furthermore, why would she want to escape with those who had been tormenting her for the last few years?</p><p>Ciel’s face turned from a bright expression to a nasty scowl. He had hoped that Sasha would join them on the escape, seeing as she was the only one among them who had killed a goblin barehanded. </p><p>“One minute left.”</p><p>Ciel and the other five made up their minds, collecting a simple dagger each from a goblin before walking out of the fort. They made a simple bow of gratitude to the man and left for a better future. Ciel gave a final glance at Sasha, one of pity as though she had chosen wrong. This irked Sasha even more, causing her to clench her fist. <em>I’ll get stronger than all of you idiots, and one day, I’ll have my revenge.</em></p><p>The man turned to Sasha, who was the only one left. “How good are you with a crossbow? Nod for good to great, shake for not good.”</p><p>Sasha nodded her head slightly. The forest fort had crossbows, and while she had never received any formal training, her time sneaking around the weapon storage and testing them gave her a basic understanding. </p><p>The man handed her a crossbow, one she recognized to be Orthon’s personalized one. “Show me.”</p><p>Sasha glanced around the mine entrance, noticing a dummy strawman used for target practice. She aimed the crossbow carefully, firing a single bolt and nailing the target on the head. She then handed the crossbow back to the man respectfully. </p><p>“Good enough. Are you ready for your first mission?” The man handed her a Strength Potion and a Stamina Potion, telling her to drink them. </p><p>Sasha felt a satisfying rush of strength, as though she had somehow grown more muscles out of nowhere, while her body felt like it had eaten well for weeks. She had never felt better before, nodding vigorously in response to the man’s question. </p><p>The man tossed her the crossbow and a simple knife. “There are six liabilities running toward the town through the forest now. Kill them all before they spread the word that we are here.”</p><p>Chapter 27: Racketeering</p><p>“Gulak, send three goblins to observe her. Once she has killed all six, drag the bodies here. If she tries to run, kill her as well. No one leaves the forest alive.” Kyle motioned as he watched Sasha leave the main entrance.</p><p>“To feed the pit?” Gulak excitedly asked. “What about the failed slaves?”</p><p>“Those who died during the surgery, throw them in the pit too. The rest who are still alive, keep them in their rooms and cage them.”</p><p>“Ah, for future food, I see.” Gulak bowed, leaving Kyle alone. </p><p>He did not trust any of the slaves, not even Sasha. However, based on his observation, the woman had all the right inclinations to be molded into the perfect weapon. <em>Hatred, revenge, anger—all of this can be easily manipulated.</em></p><p>Kyle walked down to a different set of rooms, where the failed slaves were being held. Most of them had devolved into rabid primal humans, growling and snapping at Kyle. He had lied to Ciel and the other five, saying that all the other slaves had died.</p><p>In truth, Kyle had managed to save almost all the slaves except for the ones he had killed in Paulie’s house. He looked into a room, noticing a failed slave that looked like Ciel’s father, twisting and groaning on the floor. <em>At least your family will be useful for Sasha’s training.</em></p><p>Thanks to the number of human subjects, he had managed to figure out an approximate success rate of the Taboo Knife. It was abysmal—a measly seven out of fifty. His sample size and type of bodies were not exactly in the ideal state or range, but it was a telling sign that he shouldn’t try it on himself without further assurances.</p><p>It would be impossible to do it without someone’s help. The pain of engraving the arcite under the skin seemed immeasurable, and he would not be able to grip the knife effectively. Just one wrong move, and the engraving would not be as effective or create a completely different effect. </p><p>Kyle would not say he did not trust anyone. He trusted Damian and Keith to handle affairs while he was gone due to mutual benefits, but he would not trust them to do such complicated surgery. <em>I will have to find an extremely competent arctech engraver to do this, and I must establish trust or threat. </em></p><p>He had performed a simple operation on all the human slaves, engraving the exact same enchantment he had been practicing—the force-increasing enchantment from Riker’s metal pipe. Engraving an enchantment did not mean it was the end, as Kyle could simply cut off the skin where it was engraved and re-healing it, generating new skin to try again. However, with no anesthesia, it would prove to be a huge problem. </p><p>There was another huge problem he encountered: he had verified who was backing the forest bandits. When Troy had told him the truth, he was a bit hesitant to truly accept it, but after hearing Paulie’s final words, he was certain. <em>The Violet Demons, the second major gang of the West Sector… If they found out I pillaged their business, this could be a big problem. I have to hide my tracks as much as possible. It would be best if I remained here for a while longer to stave off the heat.</em></p><p>Kyle had already been away from Raktor for close to a month. For all he knew, the Seven Snakes might have been taken over by another gang leader, but this was a necessary expedition to clear the debt owed to the Crimson Snakes. </p><p>He also knew that if he left the goblins alone right now, they would not work for him any longer, immediately rebelling. <em>Someone has to stay behind and supervise them with force. That’s the only way.</em> </p><p>This meant that he would need to stay for a month longer until everything was nicely set up and could operate independently. <em>Once the Euria Seeds hit the streets of Raktor, the prices will plummet, but at the scale I’m selling them, the profits will be immense. One million rakels will be done in a single week if everything goes right.</em></p><p>Just as he was thinking deeply, the gates of the wooden barricade around the main entrance opened to reveal Sasha dragging one of the six who had left back alive, while three goblins behind her dragged the dead slaves back to the fort. All of them wore faces of shock or anger and their foreheads had a crossbow bolt lodged in them. </p><p>Kyle’s eyes squinted as Sasha dragged the remaining slave in front of him before kneeling. “The mission was to kill all of them. Why have you kept this one alive?”</p><p>Instead of Sasha talking, the slave immediately groveled on all fours, begging with tears streaming down her face. “Please, let me live! I made the wrong choice! I used to be a clerk! I can read and write and do whatever you need! I’ll be your slave!” She was clearly shaken by the slaves being killed by Sasha. </p><p>Kyle pondered for a moment, glancing at Sasha’s expression. <em>While she did not follow the orders to the letter, it seems that she has brought me back an underling. Adaptability on the fly is great as well. This will be interesting. </em></p><p>“Good. Sasha, since you kept her alive, you will be in charge of her discipline. If she tries to go against me, you have every right to punish her. Name?”</p><p>“Merissa, sir!” </p><p>“Get up and follow me, both of you.”</p><p>Kyle led them to another room that was now designed like an office. Kyle intended to handle the logistics of shipping the Euria Seeds out into Raktor here, but with Merissa and Sasha here, they could assist him with the entire operation. </p><p>“Merissa. You will now tally the number of Euria Seeds collected and delivered every single day without fail. You are also in charge of ensuring the well-being of the goblins. In the event they try to rebel, you immediately tell me or Sasha. Understood?”</p><p>Sasha tugged at Kyle’s clothes, pointing to the office table and doing a cross with her arms, shaking her head vigorously. “You can’t read and write? Not an issue. You will learn in a week.” Kyle dismissed her.</p><p>Kyle quickly showed Merissa the basics, the woman trembling all the while. She was acutely aware that Sasha had been ordered by Kyle to kill them all, so she remained docile and compliant, following Kyle’s orders. </p><p>Kyle then brought Sasha out back to the single rooms where the failed slaves were held. “Over the next month, I will teach you how to read, write, and fight. We will also learn how you can activate the engraving on your body to your benefit. At the end of the training, you will be strong enough to kill everyone in this den. You will then be in charge of overall operations here, ensuring Euria Seeds are being delivered consistently. Anyone who steps out of line will be yours to punish. Understood?”</p><p>Sasha nodded vigorously. She already planned to make the most of her time here—to make herself stronger and independent. This was the best training arc she could have hoped for. </p><p>“Good, let’s begin.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Sebastian entered the grand office of Bishop Vernette alone, smiling at the two inquisitors and bishop who were waiting for him. </p><p>“You’re a hard man to meet, Mr. Sebastian.” Mason stood up to shake his hand. “Took a month of beating up your associates to even get you to respond.”</p><p>“My apologies. I was busy with some other personal matters.” Sebastian sat down quietly in a nice velvet chair, crossing his legs. He glanced at the serene face of Mason, contrasted by the obviously hostile expression on Kitana’s face. “I assume she’s the mad dog being let loose on us. Since when were the inquisitors this violent?”</p><p>“Want to find out how much more we can get?” Kitana grinned, grabbing the pistol at her waist. </p><p>Sebastian did not flinch. “Not interested. I’m more interested in how such a young inquisitor could turn out to be the most bloodthirsty in history.” </p><p>“Let’s just say your men were very adamant in resisting arrest. Nothing else we could do.” Mason smoked his pipe before tapping it on the edge of the table. “Let’s get straight to the point. Baron Cain wants more money.”</p><p>“How much more?” Sebastian didn’t care about his associates getting killed. They had thousands of them—a few dozen or so dying was just a statistic to him. </p><p>“I’m not privy to how much he specifically wants, but you should know how angry Baron Cain gets.”</p><p>“So, you’re killing my members, trashing my businesses, and then asking me to pay you?”</p><p>“Sounds about right. Shouldn’t be new to a gang that runs a protection racket.” Mason chuckled, while Kitana still glared at Sebastian. </p><p>“Mason. I came here to save my business, not take another loss.” Sebastian sighed, tapping the holster of the chair.</p><p>“I’m sure the losses of your front businesses are more than enough to warrant an increase in payment to Baron Cain.”</p><p>“I know the two of you have been investigating quite a fair bit into the factories. The entire sector is talking about it. Perhaps instead of payment, I can be of some assistance?”</p><p>Mason grinned as though he had already been expecting the conversation to twist this way, huffing out a plume of blue smoke. “What assistance?” He played dumb.</p><p>“I can provide protection to the factories you need. I’m sure the factory workers are compromised beyond belief and will never talk to an enforcer. I already have my men inside. I know everything.”</p><p>“How do we know you’re not going to nick the goods themselves?” Kitana scoffed. </p><p>“For one who likes to kill so much, you’re surprisingly naïve.” Sebastian let out a small laugh, infuriating Kitana slightly. “I’m business-focused first and foremost. Stability is the best for business. We’re on the same team here, you and I.”</p><p>“I think my definition of stability is not the same as yours.” </p><p>Mason held up his hand to stop Kitana. “What about the districts outside of your jurisdiction?”</p><p>“Well, again. Stability is my main concern. I do not step into other gangs’ districts without permission, and I highly doubt any of the other gangs would be willing to allow me to establish a permanent presence there in their factories. But I can assure you that the factories in my district will not be touched. That reduces the number of factories that you need to protect.”</p><p>“Who said anything about your help—” Kitana started, but Mason held up his hand again. </p><p>“When can you start?”</p><p>“Don’t be so impatient. We have yet to discuss what you will offer me.”</p><p>“It’s obvious; no payment required to the Baron.”</p><p>“I want a deal that my businesses and members will not be touched for the next two years,” Sebastian stated. </p><p>“Two years?!” Mason was taken aback. “You’re out of your mind! A free pass for two years?”</p><p>“I was not talking to you, seeing as you don’t have the power to make such a deal yourself. Isn’t that right, Bishop Vernette?”</p><p>The bishop, who had been staying out of the conversation, sighed, finally putting down her pen. “Only if your men will protect the factories for that same duration.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Then we do have a deal. So long as the protection lasts.”</p><p>“Good. I will be moving my men into the factories tomorrow. Tell your enforcers to get out of our way from now on. And stop killing my men. Do not think you’re invincible.” Sebastian bowed to the bishop before leaving the office. </p><p>Mason and Kitana sat back down on the sofa, the angry expression on the young woman’s face dissipating quickly. “Well, that went rather well.” Kitana smiled as she leaned back onto the sofa, her zealous, haughty attitude long gone. </p><p>It was a ploy by Mason and Kitana: have Kitana act as an enthusiastic inquisitor and beat up gang members, forcing the gang members to come to the table to parley. </p><p>“Like I said, carrot and stick. Now we only have to cover the remainder of the factories.” Mason eyed the map pinned on the wall, checking the remaining twenty districts.</p><p>“So I get to beat up another gang?”</p><p>“Maybe, maybe not. We do have enough manpower to watch over the remaining factories, though just barely. Too many different gangs watching the factories might incite them to backstab each other. Besides, with the rumors we’ve been putting out, no one should be stupid enough to hijack our factories.”</p><p>Chapter 28: Attempted Takeover</p><p><em>Two weeks later…</em></p><p>The Culdao Peaks Town had become even more of a bustling hub of trade, the market packed to the brim. Dozens of wagons and caravans shuttled crates of Euria Seeds to and fro from the town toward the city of Raktor, prompting new businesses to sprout up along the way. </p><p>The inn that Kyle stayed at had the best businesses, with the number of merchants and travelers trying to cash in on the amount of traffic going through as well as profit from the price difference of Euria Seeds between the town and Raktor. </p><p>“Did you hear the news? I heard one of the companies is under attack by the other five!”</p><p>“Really? Didn’t the six of them agree to share the habitat? Why would they renege on the agreement now?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but it seems to me that eventually only one company will remain standing. As profitable as it is, I don’t think it’s large enough for six companies to share.” </p><p>The rumors floated around the town like wildfire. It was to be expected, as it gave the town a new breath of life. Strangers from the city of Raktor that they had never seen before were now entering frequently, using the town as a base station hub for transportation. The companies’ workers would bring large baskets on their backs into the forest, harvesting the seeds and selling them off en masse in the town.</p><p>Other independent adventurers and townsfolk tried to get in on the action but were somehow deterred by goblin archers and warriors defending the habitat. The biggest rumor was that the six companies had somehow managed to broker a deal with the goblins. Some townsfolk had even heard rumors of metalware and forging equipment being delivered to the goblin den. </p><p>“Trading human weaponry for Euria Seeds. This might be dangerous in the future! What if the goblins decide to turn around and attack us?”</p><p>“Bah, they’re numerous but weak! Without anybody training them, they are no better than a kid with a sword. Our Yual Dominion’s knights can easily flatten them. If they don’t come on time, then the gangs from the city of Raktor would take care of them easily.”</p><p>It was no secret that the gangs of Raktor were beginning to take notice of this massive venture, hoping to cash in on some of the profits. They had eyes everywhere, disguising themselves as travelers, escorts, adventurers, and merchants. </p><p>One such traveler, draped in a cloak, sat near the market, observing the crowded area as some of the Euria Seeds harvested by the companies were sold right here, while the rest were shipped at wholesale prices to various parts of Raktor. Merchants jostled with each other to choose the best basket, throwing hands. </p><p>The traveler was sipping on his water flask just as a young boy ran up to him. He whispered into the boy’s ear, “Good, here’s your rakels.” He placed a hundred rakels into the boy’s hands, who grinned widely and ran off. He got up from his chair, moving slowly but with purpose through the crowd, targeting a well-dressed gentleman in a suit. </p><p>He revealed a concealed knife from his wrist, jabbing the tip into the back of the gentleman, who froze. “Don’t make a sound. I’m sure you don’t want your wife to see your dead body on the ground here. You’re not the only company executive I can use, Feldon.” The traveler whispered to the gentleman.</p><p>Feldon instinctively gulped and nodded vigorously. The traveler nudged him with an elbow, the two of them moving to a more secluded area between buildings. “Who are you? What do you want?” Feldon asked, his voice shaking. </p><p>“Which gang is behind this operation?”</p><p>“What…?” Feldon’s face was filled with confusion. The traveler pressed the same knife as before against Feldon’s neck.</p><p> “I swear, I really don’t know what you’re talking about! As far as I know, we’re a legitimate company! I only joined a week ago!”</p><p>The traveler carefully examined Feldon’s eyes before finally letting him go. “Who’s growing the Euria Seeds? There must be a hidden plantation nearby, right?”</p><p>“Huh? Our workers collect them from the forest. The area is filled with ripe Euria Trees!”</p><p>“Yet only the six companies can collect from that particular area? Do you think I’m stupid?” The traveler scowled, pointing the knife at him.</p><p>“Look, it’s my first time here as well! I was just supposed to oversee the transfer and sale of Euria Seeds here. That’s all!” Feldon pleaded with a fearful expression. </p><p>“Bring me to the habitat.”</p><p>“W-What?! No, you’ll be killed. I don’t even know if I am allowed in!” </p><p>“You’re a company overseer. I’m sure you’ll be fine. MOVE!” the traveler growled and continued aiming the knife at Feldon, forcing him to move under coercion. </p><p>They re-entered the market area, with the traveler nodding to two other random strangers. They each had a different outfit to blend in, but they all came from the same gang. They hefted large backpacks, no doubt filled with weapons.</p><p>The four of them moved into the forest from a different approach, with Feldon forced to be in the lead. The other two opened their backpacks, passing a crossbow to the traveler.</p><p>“Keep your eyes peeled. Have your crossbows at the ready. If it’s the Veiled Angels running this operation, we kill on sight. Too many, and we run,” the traveler ordered the other two.</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Feldon’s mind was racing as he stumbled through the foliage, continuously peeking behind him, only to see three crossbows ready to shoot him if he tried to run. <em>Veiled Angels? If they’ve got beef, it means that the three of them must be from the Violet Demons!</em></p><p>The two gangs were currently at war with each other in the West Sector, with bloodbaths appearing whenever and wherever they clashed. This applied outside the city as well—money was money after all. The Violet Demons were not about to let the Veiled Angels be the only ones to profit from such a scheme. </p><p><em>Taking down our forest bandits and setting up their own operation? If these guys think they can get away with it, they are dead wrong…</em> The traveler smirked as they trudged through the forest. They passed a few Euria Trees, but they could no longer spot any seeds on the branches or leaves, no doubt being harvested by the companies already. </p><p>Suddenly, a warning arrow swooped in, landing right at their feet. It was a crudely made goblin arrow, short and stubby. The group looked up to see three goblin archers perched on the branches of trees, aiming down at them with their short bows. Feldon screamed in reflex, trying to run away, before the traveler grabbed him by the throat and slapped his cheek.</p><p>“Idiot, your company already has a deal with them! Just show your company emblem!”</p><p>“Right, right.” Feldon fumbled as he searched through his suit’s pockets, his breath still erratic. He quickly retrieved a metallic emblem engraved with a simple logo of the company. </p><p>The goblins did not aim at Feldon any longer but aimed their bows at the remaining three. “Looks like we’re not getting a free pass after all.” The traveler sighed and lifted Feldon as a shield and hostage. They walked forward, the other two aiming at the two goblins with bulky crossbows. </p><p>“Keep moving!” the traveler growled at Feldon, who quickly moved. However, a single arrow grazed Feldon’s cheek before a gurgling sound was heard behind him. He turned to see the traveler’s neck pierced from the front by the arrow as he collapsed to the ground. </p><p>“Fuck!” The remaining two lifted their crossbows, firing bolt after bolt at the goblins. The two goblins did not stand a chance, their bodies riddled with bolts and dropping to the ground. However, another zipping sound could be heard, with one of the remaining two screaming out in pain as the arrow pierced his chest, embedding itself in his heart. </p><p>“Who’s there!? Veiled Angels? Stop shooting if you don’t want him to die!” The last man immediately grabbed Feldon as a hostage, a knife aimed at the neck while his other free hand hefted the crossbow in the direction where the arrow came in from. </p><p>No one replied, and no more arrows came in. A bead of sweat began to trickle and snake its way down the man’s face as the tension began to build within. He glanced everywhere, trying to spot any movement. All he could hear was the rustling of the leaves and the sounds of animal cries from the distance. </p><p>Out of the blue, a searing pain erupted from his back, stemming from a dagger plunged deep by a young lady. Her face was apathetic as the man yelled out in shock, immediately using his crossbow as a blunt weapon to try and hit her. </p><p>Her short black hair floated as she ducked before retrieving another dagger from her belt, jabbing both ankles of the man in rapid succession, causing him to fall on both legs. Both his crossbow and Feldon fell to the ground as well.</p><p>“Wait! I have money! Just let me go!” the man shouted in a final attempt to sway the young lady, but she showed no reaction. She did not even grace him with a response. “Fine! I won’t go down without a fig—”</p><p>The man tried to say more, but his cheeks were already pierced by a crossbow bolt from his own crossbow, now wielded by the young lady. A few more bolts ended his life, with Feldon still shivering as he stared at the three dead bodies. <em>I signed up to be a manager, not a fighter!</em></p><p>The young lady grabbed Feldon by the waist, lifting him up and walking deeper into the forest toward the mountain. “W-Where are you bringing me? The town is the other way!”</p><p>Feldon tried to convince her to change directions, but she did not reply anymore, almost as though she were mute. They soon reached an abandoned mine, where the wooden palisade walls were crawling with goblins, which freaked Feldon out even more. </p><p>They entered the fort, with the young lady unceremoniously dumping Feldon onto the ground. </p><p>“Good work, Sasha. Gulak, send out the goblins to collect the bodies,” Kyle ordered with a satisfied expression on his face. “Ah, you must be one of the new employees. Feldon, was it? Welcome to the source of the Euria Seeds.” He helped Feldon up, who patted his already bloodstained suit in vain.</p><p>Feldon was surprised they knew about him when it was his first time visiting. He knew the goblins were at peace with the companies, but not to the extent where company members could stay at the den itself. “I—I demand an explanation! What in the world is going on here?”</p><p>“Sasha, head back and take a rest.” Kyle motioned toward the entrance. “As for your explanation, it is very simple. I am the one running this entire operation. My name is Kyle, gang leader of the Seven Snakes.”</p><p>“What?! How?! I thought…”</p><p>“We have a problem now, Feldon. It seems you’ve been marked by the Violet Demons, and they are trying to use you as a way to sneak their way into this operation. Releasing you back into the town will only raise even more suspicion, placing you under an even bigger threat.”</p><p>Feldon pondered for a moment before suddenly realizing what Kyle was implying. “You’re… You’re suggesting I stay here permanently! No! No way in hell! My wife and kids are still out there in the town!”</p><p>“Oh, Celine, Mick, and Daphne? Of course, I will bring them here as well for their protection.” The accuracy with which Kyle knew about Feldon frightened him even more. “Sasha will handle it.”</p><p>“I’m a prisoner now! My relatives are all in Raktor, my kids’ school is there too, you can’t just—”</p><p>Kyle suddenly grabbed Feldon by the neck, lifting him up. “You seem to be misunderstanding something here. You don’t have a choice. Your life is now in my hands. Make the wrong move, and I can’t say what’ll happen to dear Celine.”</p><p>Feldon immediately clamped up, nodding vigorously as his hands desperately tried to loosen Kyle’s grip. Kyle dropped him on the ground, ordering the goblins to show him to his new room. Feldon soon noticed that he wasn’t the only one here—plenty of other company workers who were compromised by the gangs were now sheltered here. </p><p>Gringer ran up to Kyle, bowing respectfully. “Sir, one of the companies seemed to have turned over to another gang. The Euria Seeds are being passed for free to their wagons just outside the town.”</p><p>“Looks like the attack from the other five companies was not enough to keep them in line. Kill every worker from that company who comes to pick up the baskets.” </p><p>The workers did not directly interact with the goblins, instead exchanging baskets at known locations agreed upon throughout the forest. The workers only knew this was part of the deal to not interact with the goblins, but it was a ploy by Kyle to ensure that no one knew the real nature of the operation. </p><p>Keith was the one who set up the companies in Raktor but had used frontmen to serve as the fall guys in case anything went wrong. The money invested was through yet another shell company, so even if the company’s head told the controlling gang who funded him, it would end up in a dead end.</p><p>With this, Kyle had established a safe trading network of Euria Seeds, where he was the only direct profiteer. At the same time, he was training Sasha and a few of the compromised company workers, forming a secret force of his own. It had only been two weeks since he had started, but good progress was already being made. </p><p>Kyle already had plans for this force to serve as a hidden dagger that he could use to strike at other gangs’ operations in the region or even enter Raktor undetected to fight in the South Sector. </p><p>With this, even if the other gangs were watching his movements, they would be unaware of this new hidden force. Sasha was also designated as a follower with Kyle’s Designate Follower skill, a new arcia engraving appearing on her neck that allowed them to telepathically communicate over a long distance. The range was limited, only working up within five kilometers. </p><p>Kyle could not stay here forever—he would have to show his face in the South Sector as well as ensure everything was going on track. With only two months left to repay the debt, he could only hope there would be no major disruptions. </p><p><em>Looks like I’ve done everything I could here. It’s time to return to check on the progress in the South Sector.</em></p><p>Chapter 29: Hijacking</p><p>The return of Kyle to the Seven Snakes was hushed and kept on the down low, with no fanfare. Kyle did not want to tip off any of the observers, be it the enforcers or other gangs like the Ardent Cretins. </p><p>He had left Sasha and the company workers behind in the goblin den to serve as the logistics and defenders, while the five remaining loyal companies continued to work as planned. Some of the workers definitely skimmed some of the Euria Seeds, but Kyle did not care as long as they did not eat too much into their profits. Kyle wasn’t leaving the Culdao Peaks entirely, planning to rotate his time between the two locations by using the company’s transport network to sneak himself in and out.</p><p>Kyle had returned three days after the reopening of the Seductive Serpent, and it was indeed a roaring success. Both old and new customers poured in like a never-ending tide, making the pub busy even during the day. In terms of financials, it was doing much better than the Lusty Arcian just due to its scale and business model. </p><p>The pub had been remodeled to a swanky new renovation layout, with a small, quaint restaurant serving as the front, while behind the kitchen was the main area filled with private rooms as well as multiple secondary sections that featured different types of music. It also had various stages for musicians to perform on, providing yet another avenue for aspiring players to make their name well-known. This was yet another small facet of Kyle’s plan to integrate the Seven Snakes into the local ecosystem, ensuring their influence over multiple industries. </p><p>Kyle noted a few of the customers were smoking Euria Seeds as well. The combination of the relaxing smoke and the chill atmosphere ensured that they stayed there nearly the entire day, only leaving to buy more Euria Seeds or matchsticks. <em>It is good that we have acquired a source of cheap Euria Seeds—this place could be half-turned into a full smoking den.</em></p><p>He met with Eric Dicar, who was now running the pub full-time while the inhouse brewery was just right behind. A wide, beaming smile could be seen plastered on his face. “This is far better than I dreamed of. I always wanted to run my own pub with my own creations.” </p><p><em>Hook, line, and sinker. Which alcoholic would refuse the offer to run a pub, and for free at that? </em>Kyle talked at length with Eric about his objectives for the pubs before leaving for the Seven Snakes’ base again. </p><p>“Sir, here’s the updated member list, along with the new recruits gathered in the time you were missing,” Damian presented. “Keith and I have decided on the list of vipers now. While Monica and Adrian are fairly new compared to other members, their skills in their respective roles cannot be understated. As far as we can tell, they have no misgivings toward the Seven Snakes apart from their initial capture and the underlying threat of blackmail.”</p><p>Kyle glanced through the list, focused on the vipers who acted as squad leaders. “Monica, Adrian, Niko…” He recalled Niko being one of the young men that he had seen at the Lusty Arcian while fighting off Lionel. The Seven Snakes had more than fifty associates now, but Kyle had not met all of them yet. </p><p>The new vipers had climbed the ranks due to their hard working ethic and their ability to hustle, allowing the Seven Snakes to slowly spread across the district. This, combined with the effects of the soup kitchen and the weekly public clean-up events, had skyrocketed Seven Snakes’ reputation in the community. <em>All according to plan.</em></p><p>“I trust your decision and choice.” Kyle nodded his head, but deep down, he still did not trust all of them. The betrayal in his former life still ran deep in his veins, and his plans were centered around himself for now. It wasn’t an issue of competency but a deep sense of insecurity hidden within, though Kyle did not openly acknowledge it yet. </p><p>“We seem to be on track to pay off the debt in the next two months, assuming no further hiccups. I think we’ve done it.” Keith grinned. </p><p>None of the Euria Seeds were bought by the Seven Snakes gang; instead, they were routed to the other sectors to reduce their trail. Kyle complimented Keith on the complicated paper trail, ensuring no one would be able to find out. Money was collected in cold, hard cash in person rather than through bank accounts, preventing traces by the local authorities, while the money would be cleaned and layered through the various Seven Snakes businesses. </p><p>The new supply of Euria Seeds did drop the prices in the market area, allowing Kyle to make even more profits on his addictive potions, which had been selling like hotcakes in the expanded Lusty Arcian as well as the new pub.</p><p>With this, he could generate enough money to pay off the debt to the Crimson Swords, which meant his gang was in the clear for now. Kyle heaved a sigh of relief, as did Damian and Keith, knowing that one burden was finally off their shoulders. </p><p>“We also have the casino nearly ready to go. A few more days, and it will be up and running,” Keith explained. “The extra time was due to there being no existing locations that had casinos—the enforcers had shut down most of them, and with the current level of heat we’re facing, we’re going to need to put in extra effort to hide it as much as possible.”</p><p>Kyle nodded in understanding. Running a gang was an eternal battle against the law and other gangs. Every expanding gang would have to contend with the local enforcers, who usually turned a blind eye until something grew too big. Right now, they were nearing that threshold. Damian had gotten a few corrupt enforcers on the gang’s payroll, reducing the heat, but there seemed to be trouble looming on the horizon. </p><p>It was due to a piece of news that shocked Kyle when he returned— the raids by the enforcers on the Ardent Cretins. It was reported to be extremely brutal, with many low-level grunts killed by what seemed to be an overzealous inquisitor. </p><p>“Isn’t it a good thing that they got raided? That reduces their financial advantage over us, allowing us to expand outward even more. Right now, we’re stuck in this district because of them. If the enforcers keep this up, we might have a chance to claw away some of the less defended areas.” Damian reasoned. </p><p>“No. It hints that the new inquisitors who recently took office are finding evidence and warrants or going all out. They are targeting the big fish for now as they generate the most heat, but soon, the increased surveillance will trickle down to us.” Kyle knew the Ardent Cretins must have had local enforcers on their payroll, so for them to get raided meant that there had been a sweeping change in law enforcement, or at least the purpose of law enforcement.</p><p>“Indeed, they are clearing the low-hanging fruit first of the big gangs, trying to weaken them. Did you see the West Sector? It’s almost in full-blown conflict now—a three-way fight between the Veiled Angels, Violet Demons, and the enforcers.” Keith handed a newspaper over to Kyle. </p><p>Kyle read the article, frowning slightly. <em>The Ardent Cretins limiting us now is the least of our worries—the inquisitors seem to be on a warpath for some reason. </em></p><p>“When was the last time inquisitors came to the city?”</p><p>“Erm… I don’t think it was when any of us were around…” Damian shook his head. He had only been in the gang for five years and had never heard of inquisitors coming. However, it was obvious that the Seven Snakes could come under greater scrutiny from now on. Every step had to be measured.</p><p><em>One problem after another.</em> Just when Kyle thought he was in the clear, here was another obstacle. </p><p>“We will now come up with contingency plans to deflect as much heat from the enforcers as possible. We might be on track to pay off the debt, but the enforcers can restrict our operations, which would hurt us financially.” Kyle began to pace the room, thinking hard and recalling all the methods he used to evade the Galactic Council in the past.</p><p>“It’s not enough to entice the corrupt enforcers. We need to blackmail them. Set them up with sex workers from the brothel if possible, or have them gamble at the new casino. Use our connections with the locals. Bribe them to do it if they must.” Kyle’s tone was urgent, and he spoke quickly.</p><p>“Damian, increase the number of informants we have in the local enforcers through this method.”</p><p>“Keith, we will need to begin shifting the Seven Snakes base as well into a more decentralized version. And the fronts that we currently have in place for the pub and casino should be replicated for the brothel too.”</p><p>“Already on it, sir.” Keith nodded. “I already have the Lusty Arcian remodeled to be a beauty school at the front. As for the Seven Snakes’ base, we’re in the process of acquiring a total of seven different locations that our members can rotate through. The brewery will be shifted as well, along with Professor Dicar.”</p><p>“How soon can we get the relocation done?”</p><p>“About a week. Not a lot of setups are needed, just the part on acquiring a lot of safehouses.”</p><p>“Good, I want us cleared out of here by then before we get hit. Get Monica, Niko, and Adrian in. I want the vipers to report what they’ve been doing in the past few weeks since I left.”</p><p>The three of them soon entered, lining up in front of Kyle. Kyle did not trust them fully yet, but seeing that they had been promoted out of the recruits meant that Damian and Keith did. </p><p>“Monica, you’re in charge of smuggling the alcohol brewed by Professor Dicar to our ventures. Any updates?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. The enforcers have been doing more regular wagon checks, trying to catch anyone flouting the prohibition bans. We’ve been disguising the wagons as food supplies or potions, but we did have a few wagons caught over the last two months.”</p><p>This wasn’t good. Alcohol was the lifeblood of the brothels, pubs, and casinos. “Damian, fix this issue. Make sure the patrolling enforcers don’t bother us any longer. Next, Adrian.”</p><p>Adrian was in charge of observing the district, trying to pick out other gangs’ spies or newly formed thug rackets. He used to be one of them, so he had experience spotting the same signs. “Yes, sir. My squad has rooted out five thug outfits so far. We’ve successfully converted three of them into our own affiliate rackets in exchange for protection from other thug gangs. Two thug gangs were imprisoned and are currently used by Eric in alcohol testing.”</p><p>Kyle nodded, unfazed. Alcohol brewing wasn’t exactly lethal, but a bad batch would be insufferable as well. It's better to try it on a few humans before serving it to their loyal customers. His eyes landed on Niko.</p><p>“Yes, sir! Security at our ventures has been stable. So far, no incursions or raids by enforcers.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“Yes, sir…” Niko was obviously flustered by his lack of activity compared to the other two. The lackluster reaction from Kyle pained him. <em>I need to do something big if I want Kyle to recognize me.</em></p><p>“Good. Keep it that way. Enforcer activity is increasing, so please keep your men under control. Do not do anything to give us away to the enforcers,” Kyle lectured before dismissing all of them from his office.</p><p><em>Law enforcement never changes, no matter which universe, huh?</em> Kyle smiled to himself. While there was definitely a threat from the enforcers now rising, Kyle had dealt with this for his entire former life. <em>As long as I play my cards right, we can make something out of this. </em><p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The restaurant was packed to the brim. Weary factory managers just clocking off the shift, stall owners who just had a good run at the food market, or administrative clerks complaining about their day. A hundred tables and booths were filled up, with two dozen waiters going back and forth. </p><p>An old factory worker entered the restaurant, his attire shabby and grimy, stained with the grease from working the machines. He rubbed his hands anxiously, walking up to a waiter. </p><p>“Excuse me, sir. Do you need something?” The waiter was confused, wondering why the older factory worker was standing in front of him.</p><p>“Hi, I’m looking for a toilet. Really urgent. Preferably one with a golden snake.”</p><p>“Ah, just right down the double doors, turn left and you’ll find it.” The waiter nonchalantly motioned behind him.</p><p>The old factory worker weaseled his way through the tables, trying to ignore the weird stares he was getting from the restaurant customers. He reached the double doors, opening to reveal a crowded kitchen with the smell of oil and spices filling the air. </p><p>He walked through them with trepidation, stealing a quick glance at the chefs. None of them seemed to be particularly bothered that he was there, despite not being a chef or a staff member. Navigating through the tight space, he soon reached a discreet black door, knocking on it with a specific pattern. </p><p>A small sliding notch slid open, revealing a pair of piercing eyes. “Who?” A gruff voice wafted from behind the door. </p><p>“I know Niko! Let me in!” the older factory worker said desperately. </p><p>The sliding notch closed, and the door opened. “One wrong move and you’re dead, old man.” The guard grinned, motioning for him to enter. </p><p>The sight beyond the door was a completely different view from the rest of the posh restaurant. Card games, dice games—every gambling game you could think of was right here. High-rollers surrounded by escorts laughed their heads on as they watched their opponents squirm on their velvet chairs. Bartenders served alcohol non-stop, with some of the customers already clearly drunk but still paying right out of their weekly pay. </p><p>The old factory worker tried his best to avoid the others, finding his way through the casino. Unfortunately, he bumped into a large Seven Snakes associate, who glared at him in anger. “Old man, you lost? Or a snitch? Whatchu doing here? Who let you in?!”</p><p>“I—I—”</p><p>“He’s with me. Back off, Bosso.” A young man wrapped in bling and a formal suit shoved the large guard away, who immediately lost his anger and scurried away, as though afraid of the young man.</p><p>“Niko!” The old factory worker patted him on the shoulders before examining him. He was the one who had introduced Niko to the Lusty Arcian in the first place. “You’re all grown up now! Look at you!”</p><p>“Haha, thanks Karl. How’s the factory been treating you?” Niko motioned to an empty booth on the side, already pre-arranged with drinks and snacks. </p><p>“Oh, you know, same old, same old. Manager got a bit pissy as usual…” Karl sat down in the booth gingerly, feeling the velvet. This level of comfort was far beyond anything he was used to, having grown up poor. He glanced at Niko, who seemed to be comfortable in this area. </p><p>“HAHA! They always get pissy, even if you do everything right. Anyway, the drinks are for you; have a go. We got our own in-house thing going now, so our alcohol is top of the line now, or at least that’s what I think.” Niko poured a glass of wine, handing it to Karl. </p><p>“I don’t have any money left. I spent it all on the potions from the brothel… I just can’t kick the habit, you know? I tried borrowing money from the bankers and moneylenders, but they are all complaining about my low income…” Karl’s face was downtrodden as he swirled the glass of wine, wondering if he needed to pay for it. </p><p>“Karl.” Niko suddenly grabbed the old man’s shoulder, staring at him. “This? All of this? Free. On the house. For old times’ sake.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Of course! We’re friends!” Niko grabbed his own glass of wine. “Cheers!”</p><p>They drank happily, talking about their past time in the factory together and reminiscing over shared memories. </p><p>“So… why the sudden visit?” Niko finally got to the point. “Don’t say for old times’ sake.”</p><p>Karl’s happy expression was frozen in place as he slowly put down the glass. “I need some extra cash, and seeing as the banks aren’t helping, I was hoping…”</p><p>“To borrow from me? Sure, Karl, but I need more assurance that you’re going to pay me back. I know exactly how much the factory pays you and how much you spend on the brothel.”</p><p>“Look, I swear I’ll pay you back. I’ll cut down on my brothel visits, and even if I don’t pay back, you can take my assets or—”</p><p>“Don’t fuck with me, Karl. I’m not the same naïve boy. You don’t have any assets left; you already pawned all of it off,” Niko snarled before suddenly slamming his glass on the table with force, frightening Karl with the sudden swap in attitude. “Be real. If you want money, you’d better come up with something valuable.”</p><p>Karl gulped internally as he saw how far Niko had changed, thoroughly intimidated. “I really don’t have anything left. I’m at my wit’s end here!”</p><p>“Are you sure? I’m confident a senior factory worker must have access to some information…” Niko grinned. </p><p>Karl’s face was slightly confused for a moment until realization dawned on his face. “You… Nononono. There’s no way. I… I’ll be fired if I help you!”</p><p>“You want the money? Or nah? You’ll even get a cut on top of that. Imagine spending every single day working on the floor, watching all those goods roll past right under your nose, knowing that you’ll never earn more than half a rakel for any of them.”</p><p>The words cut deep into Karl’s heart, but his morals still lingered. “You don’t know what you’re suggesting—the manager would call the guards and the enforcers at a moment’s notice!” Karl shook his head vigorously.</p><p>“Oh, I know <em>exactly</em> what I’m suggesting.” Just at this moment, the door to the casino opened to reveal two local enforcers still in uniform. Their piercing eyes scanned the room, eventually locking eyes with Niko. They made a beeline for the young man, but to the surprise of Karl, none of the other guards or customers even bothered, simply continuing on. </p><p>Niko stood up and shook hands with both of them, though one of them had a clearly sour expression. “You’d better have a good reason for bringing us in here.” The two enforcers sat down next to Karl, frightening him. </p><p>Niko sat down and leaned back on the booth, a wide smirk on his face. “How about a nice big cut of a factory hijacking?”</p><p>Chapter 30: Unexpected Windfall</p><p>The word on the street was all about how the enforcers were protecting the factories quite frequently. Even the Ardent Cretins seemed to be protecting their factories for some unknown reason. Rumor was that the enforcers finally had enough of the hijackings and were actually doing something serious about it.</p><p>Niko was not planning on hitting those factories, but rather the factory that he used to work at. He knew it inside out with Karl—all they made was some processed metal, minerals, and maybe a few basic household appliances. Nothing special, but still worth money when sold to the fences. </p><p>As far as Niko knew, the enforcers were not protecting the shipments of this particular factory, so Niko felt that it was a clean hit. With the insider information provided by his two corrupt enforcer buddies, Niko had high confidence in the success rate of this hijacking.</p><p>With Karl providing the delivery timing of the shipments in and out of Niko’s former factory, it was a cinch to simply set up a roadblock in the factory blocks to stop the factory wagon. The corrupt enforcers had slowly cleared out the rest of the area while claiming that they were patrolling the area to prevent the clean enforcers from spotting the hijacking.</p><p>However, the factory wagon was nearly an hour late, slightly scaring Niko that he had been betrayed by Karl. “Fuck, where is the wagon?! Have we been set up?” Niko whispered angrily to his crew. </p><p>“Not possible, sir. I don’t see any enforcers coming to arrest us. This whole block is empty!”</p><p>Niko got his crew to check around a bit and found nothing suspicious, except for the late timing of the wagon. Just as Niko was about to call off the operation and pull back, the sound of an arctech wagon could be heard rumbling through the factory blocks. “Finally!” Niko exclaimed, preparing himself for a quick and fast hit.</p><p>The wagon’s driver noticed the impending roadblock in front, the wheels screeching to a halt.</p><p>Niko and his crew attacked the wagon immediately, smashing the windows and dragging the occupants out. To their surprise, there were two additional factory workers inside who tried to fight back. The melee brawl was fast and brutal. “Private guards? I’m surprised the factory has enough money to hire you guys to guard shipments now!”</p><p>The crew killed the private guards and the driver without hesitation. Dumping their bodies into the back, they quickly drove to an intermediate point, splitting up the bolted wooden crates into five different wagons. They drove out in unpredictable routes and finally arrived at the Seven Snakes base through multiple transfers to shake off any enforcers. The bodies were unceremoniously chopped up, never to be seen again.</p><p>It was a simple plan and a routine hijacking—except for the fact that now Niko and his crew were on their knees the next day, kneeling in front of Kyle, who glared at him, while Damian and Keith were speechless, staring at the interior of the crates. </p><p>One of the crates was opened to reveal a full military arsenal unlike anything they had ever seen. Repeater arctech carbines, explosives, portable cannons, reactive armor, and defensive barrier deployables. There was enough equipment inside to outfit an entire squad of shock troopers armed to the teeth. The technology in the crates was obviously far beyond what the regular guy could get in Raktor and was most definitely not from Niko’s former factory.</p><p>What made it even worse was that the private guards’ bodies were found to have marks indicating they belonged to the Ilysian Punks. Niko gulped internally as he realized what he had just done. This meant that the Seven Snakes had effectively hijacked another gang’s truck, while said gang had stolen it from a separate source. </p><p>“Did you not even stop for a moment to realize this truck was not from the same factory?! Alarm bells should have gone off in your head the moment the planned truck was an HOUR late!” Damian roared as he berated Niko. </p><p>Niko couldn’t say anything, knowing he got too caught up in executing the hijacking in order to prove himself to Kyle. He glanced up at the gang leader, whose face was surprisingly not as angry as Damian and Keith’s. Instead, Kyle’s eyes were locked on the repeater carbines in the crates, not interested in punishing the new viper.</p><p>The carbine did not work anything like the automatic energy and particle rifles he had in his former life, but he recognized that the speed at which one could shoot with this was close to two times faster than the regular flintlock pistol. His head was racing with ideas on how he could create marginally better guns and enter the market.</p><p>Keith finished counting up the equipment. “Sir, the amount of equipment in this crate, you could outfit fifty men up to military grade. And based on what I found, it seems that the Ilysian Punks were planning on smuggling these out of the Yual Dominion back to their home country of Versia.” </p><p>Keith handed over a handwritten note found on the crates. “It also seems to be authorized by one of the top dogs of the Ilysian Punks.”</p><p>Not every gang was local—with Raktor being a trade hub near the border of the Yual Dominion, it had a lot of foreign immigrants or travelers who established their own gangs, especially from Versia.</p><p>“They had an insider in the military,” Damian concluded. “There’s no other way for them to get these many guns out other than sheer luck or a long ass stakeout at the factories.”</p><p>“If so, we’re going to be caught in a crossfire of hell. The enforcers will definitely be looking for the missing shipment; the Ilysian Punks will be after us for stealing them.” Keith sighed. “We should put this equipment back where the enforcers can easily find it or hand it back to the Ilysian Punks.”</p><p>“No,” Kyle suddenly stated. “We’re keeping them.”</p><p>“WHAT?!” Damian and Keith were shocked. </p><p>“Kyle, we’ll be trapped in an all-out war! You’re talking about robbing the military here!” Damian shook his head vigorously, extremely against the idea. “You might be able to fight off the Red Lions, but the full force of the Ilysian Punks AND the enforcers is a whole other ball game!”</p><p>“Only if they find out. Were you spotted on your way back?” Kyle asked Niko.</p><p>Niko shook his head. “No, I checked the roadblock area to ensure no observers were around. We swapped wagons five times and split up, so it’s impossible for them to have locked onto us.”</p><p>“So this means we have some time to work with this…” Kyle glanced at the repeater guns, pulling them out. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Smoothbore Arctech Repeater</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A military rifle designed by the Yual Dominion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Volley (Basic)</strong>: Fires multiple projectiles as long as one holds down the trigger and has enough in the magazine. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 25 MP.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Twenty-five MP? That’s a ridiculous consumption rate. </em>Kyle inspected the exterior of the repeater, noticing that human technology had jumped slightly faster due to the existence of arcite. It was radically different from how kinetic guns worked in his life, with the rifle’s inbuilt engraving providing explosive energy to the projectile rather than contained within a bullet casing. </p><p>Kyle’s mind raced as he thought of all the potential scenarios that could happen. The only reason they were stuck in their district now was that they lacked the strength and firepower. If he could reverse-engineer the guns and military-grade equipment, he could easily take over the entire district. </p><p>Furthermore, he had learned various engravings from his time at the Culdao Peaks, thanks to the records of the goblin shamans who marked them on pig skin.</p><p>“Kyle, whatever you’re thinking, it’s too crazy!” Damian tried to convince Kyle. “If you so much as use those guns outright to kill anyone else, the enforcers will immediately come swarming. Even our own enforcers won’t be able to protect us anymore!”</p><p>“We won’t be killing anyone with these guns. Keith, get every associate that is good with their hands to gather here. I need about ten of them. Don’t let them see each other. I want to meet each of them individually in separate rooms. Got it?”</p><p>Keith was slightly confused before his eyes finally lit up, understanding what Kyle was planning to do.</p><p>“Damian, go to the enforcers and check up on their activity. Drop a hint that the Ilysian Punks have insider knowledge of the military. Tell Adrian to keep an eye on the movement of the Ilysian Punks. They must be suspecting the Red Lions for now. Get Monica to shift half a crate over to the Red Lion district and place it in one of their pubs.”</p><p>Damian finally caught on, quickly issuing orders and leaving the base. <em>There is a chance the Ilysian Punks will try to probe us first, seeing as the hijacking happened in our district.</em></p><p>The Ilysian Punks were known to be vicious and had never done a sit-down before. Not even Sebastian of the Ardent Cretins could get them to stop their violent streaks, which is why the war between the Red Lions and the Wretches was still ongoing. </p><p>Kyle finally understood it was because the Ilysian Punks were receiving the support of a rival country beyond the border—Versia. <em>This is going to get complicated fast, but the biggest rewards always carry the biggest risk.</em></p><p>“Niko, from now on, you’re in charge of making sure no one other than us and the ten associates get near these crates, got it? We’ll slowly shift them over to a new location, where you will permanently guard.”</p><p>Niko nodded vigorously, willing to do anything now to make up for his mistake. However, there was something about the grin on Kyle’s face that made him feel like it wasn’t a mistake.</p><p>Kyle grabbed one of the repeater guns and took it back to his office to inspect the engraving. <em>The basis of a gun is simple: accelerate the projectile. As such, the engravings should be basic as well.</em></p><p>He dismantled the gun, revealing the interior of the barrel. It was layered four times, with the innermost layer being smoothbore. The three layers all had similar types of engraving aimed at accelerating the projectile through the barrel. </p><p>The magazine did not have bullets, but rather lots of tiny pellets. It seemed as though the gun was designed to fire multiple pellets at the same time when the user pulled the trigger. <em>Interesting, a slightly similar concept to a particle gun… or maybe a lethal paintball gun?</em></p><p>All he had to do now was copy the engraving multiple times. But first, Kyle was worried about the system message claiming that it was unstable. </p><p>Reassembling the gun, he loaded the magazine in before getting Niko to set up a dummy in an old room where they used to hold the prisoners. Kyle quickly made a makeshift firing range with crates and scrap metal, making sure the pellets didn’t ricochet all over the place onto him. </p><p>Aiming down the barrel, he squeezed the trigger, feeling the arcia energy within him drain outward into the rifle. The engraving lit up, accelerating the group of pellets in the barrel forward in a burst shot that blasted the dummy into pieces. </p><p>However, instead of Kyle firing another shot, he was forced to drop the gun. The barrel had become unbearably hot from the acceleration, while the MP drained from him was more than half of his max. The recoil from the shot was also too strong, reducing accuracy.</p><p><em>Did Niko pick up the defects? </em>Kyle wondered. There was a good chance that it was simply just the technology of the era as well. He had not seen the military in action yet, so he was not privy to what their technology level was. </p><p>In some sense, the technological progression path in the world was warped by arcia. Arctech wagons moved on engravings rather than on the concept of combustion, and energy was generated directly from arcite ore without the need for boiling water either. Even wireless radio technology was done via engravings. </p><p>Kyle fired the rifles a few more times, testing out different angles and firing speeds before jotting down what he needed to modify. </p><p>The idea was simple: with the military guns now in place, he could now “create” guns of a believable technological level. There was, of course, a nationwide ban on guns, but that was not going to stop Kyle.</p><p>Kyle could have made “guns” much earlier based on his former life’s knowledge, but he needed to get an idea of what the current era’s type of gun was. Making one that was far too advanced would be a disaster for his plan of lying low in the meantime. </p><p>Kyle quickly drew out the engravings he needed to implement into the new gun that he was planning to sell. He was not going to sell exactly the same type of gun, as that would be a dead giveaway. It needed to seem as though it was a natural occurrence rather than them hijacking the factory. <em>Instead of a rifle, let’s make handguns instead. </em></p><p>“Sir, I have your ten members,” Keith reported, bringing them to each room. </p><p>For the ten members, Kyle handed out the engravings he drew, giving a different one to each of them separately without them knowing who the other nine members were.</p><p>Each member of the assembly line was to engrave a specific part of the new handgun without knowing how to assemble the entire thing. Kyle didn’t trust any of the associates, so he compartmentalized the process for them. </p><p>At the end of the day, each of the members would then ship their completed batch to Kyle, where he and Niko would assemble it into its final form. <em>And, of course, I’ll add my own little touch at the end. A present for those who try to reverse-engineer my guns.</em></p><p>“Keith. The new locations, are they ready? We will need separate ones for each of the members.”</p><p>“Not yet, sir, but they have already been cleared out.”</p><p>“Good, we’ll start in two days.”</p><p>Chapter 31: Secret War</p><p>“The Red Lions took our shipment?” A burly, tanned man covered in black swirling tattoos grunted, staring down from his chair at the man kneeling in front of him, who was bruised and bleeding. “Captain, this is not an easy conclusion to make. Are you absolutely sure?”</p><p>“I… I… Uhh, no, but all of the enforcers on our payroll are talking about us smuggling guns. I think the Red Lions leaked the information out to them so as to draw more heat to us.”</p><p>“It’s impossible for anyone to know about that shipment outside of us. Captain, you are one of the rare few who planned the route.”</p><p>“I told you it’s not me! I don’t think it’s any of us. I think it was a lucky hit—” The captain shook his head vigorously as the burly man stood up to his full height, towering over him. </p><p>“So you’re saying the Red Lions got it out of <em>sheer luck? </em>Am I hearing things right? Our proud Versia men were stumped by SHEER LUCK?!” The burly man grabbed the captain by the head with one hand, a machete in the other, as he pressed the cold blade against the man’s neck. </p><p>“We fix underground matches, casinos, and races. We DON’T do luck here, Captain. Now, speak slowly about every FACT you have gathered.” The burly man let go of the captain, who coughed slightly and nodded vigorously. </p><p>“Yes, sir. Our shipment was ambushed in the Seven Snakes district, but nobody around knows about it except for the attackers and us.”</p><p>“And…?”</p><p>“Sir, that’s all we have…” the captain replied sheepishly with a bowed head. </p><p>“Then the course of action is clear. A visit to the Seven Snakes is due.”</p><p>“For a talk, sir?”</p><p>The burly man chuckled, swirling a glass of wine as he leaned back into his chair. “Captain, you never negotiate when you’re on the losing end. If the Seven Snakes have our guns, they’ll instinctively know that they have the upper hand on us. Let’s show a bit of force first.”</p><p>“Sir, this would be a declaration of war, and we’re still fighting the Red Lions—” The captain tried to continue speaking, but a machete’s blade was already lodged in the side of his neck, causing him to choke on his own blood. The burly man stood up again, squatting next to the squirming captain, who struggled to remove the machete from his neck in vain. </p><p>“The Ilysian Punks have no need for cowards, Captain,” the burly man whispered to the dying captain before snapping his fingers. Two punks came into the office, staring at the captain bleeding out. “Dispose of the body. Throw it into the incinerator or feed it to the arena monsters.”</p><p>The two punks nodded immediately, getting to work and hauling the body away. A cleaner servant also quickly entered, mopping up the blood. Nobody defied Makoa, who was a sub-leader in the Ilysian Punks.</p><p>“Oh, and set an appointment with my tattooist. I have another one to add now.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>A week later…</em></p><p>The Seven Snakes bases were now fully relocated, spread out into ten different areas, with the old place being abandoned. Kyle was still teaching how to engrave, moving between safehouses, and fixing irregularities in the etching. </p><p>Just as he was done teaching a member how to engrave a cooling enchantment onto the handle, Adrian burst into the room, panting. “Sir, the scouts have spotted the Ilysian Punks heading right for us.”</p><p>“How many?”</p><p>“About a dozen of them, all armed with melee weapons.”</p><p>“Earlier than I expected. Gather a dozen rookie associates and meet me at the food market. Time for some training.” Kyle smirked. <em>So the Ilysian Punks have decided to start a war instead of negotiating. </em></p><p>At the food market, screams and shouts filled the air instead of the usual hustle and bustle. “Get this shit out of here!” An Ilysian Punk flipped the food stall, smashing the kitchen and scaring the customers around. “This district is soon going to be run by us! Not the Seven Snakes!”</p><p>The Ilysian Punks were already at large, sending their lowest rung to mess up the area. They targeted the food market, going through and messing up each of the stalls. </p><p>“That’s right, boys, break everything in here! Those snakes ain’t got no balls to defend their own turf!” The leader of the punks laughed as they trashed the place. Some of the punks grabbed food and stuffed it into their mouths, while others set fire to crates. </p><p>Just as the leader was about to order some more, a group of men appeared at the end of the street, numbering a dozen. At the head of them was a man dressed in a formal suit, his right arm protected by a weird green vambrace. On his right hand, he held an ornate crossbow, loaded with bolts. As he strutted toward them, the members behind him struck a domineering picture.</p><p>“Oh? The boss comes out to play? Acting all strong because you won against a measly Left Paw? You ain’t fought the real deal yet. That Wrent is a bitch! SHOW THEM WHAT WE’RE MADE OF!” the leader ordered.</p><p>The punks cheered and charged them with pipes and crowbars, running in from all directions. Kyle simply snapped the fingers on his left hand, prompting the members behind to chug a quick Strength Potion before meeting the charge head-on.</p><p>The residents ducked for cover as a massive melee brawl broke out right in the food market. Even the local enforcers did not dare get involved in the brawl, knowing they very well might be killed by the crossfire. “Just let the Seven Snakes handle this; let’s get out of here!”</p><p>The Seven Snakes fighters tried to fend off the punks, but it was clear that they were far outmatched. Despite the punks’ attitude, it was clear they were all battle-hardened through multiple wars with nearby gangs, unlike the rookie associates from the Seven Snakes. </p><p>Outmatched in every way, the Seven Snakes fighters began to lose ground, slowly getting injured. The punks had no qualms about killing them, but just as one of them was about to deal the final blow, Kyle intervened, shooting three bolts into the chest of the punk. “Get up!”</p><p>The Seven Snakes member quickly scrambled to his feet, retrieving a health potion from his belt and drinking it, recovering his wounds. The leader of the punks was irked when he saw this. He knew that the Seven Snakes were well-equipped with potions, but he did not expect even their rookie fighters to be that well-treated. </p><p>“Take down the boss first!” he yelled to the punks, prompting three of them to shoot at Kyle, who activated his vambrace and blocked the incoming projectiles. </p><p>The fight continued on, with the leader continuously trying to kill Kyle and his fighters, but they were like cockroaches, healing just when they were in danger. It was as though Kyle was keeping them on edge and using the punks as training. Already, a few of his men were injured despite being stronger, a sign that their stamina was running out. </p><p>“Fuck, retreat! Don’t think you’ve seen the last of us!” The punks fell back, beating a hasty retreat. The food market was left in ruins, all the stalls beaten back. </p><p>“Get every other free member out here to fix up the market. Tell Keith to pay all the stall owners back,” Kyle ordered, much to the gratitude of the locals. It felt as though the Seven Snakes had everything under control with Kyle in the reins, so the trust among the locals was not shaken. </p><p>However, Kyle was not happy. He knew that the Ilysian Punks were simply probing for the guns. Their shipment had been attacked here, after all. It was no surprise that the Ilysian Punks would try to test and see if they were dumb enough to show the guns off. Kyle wasn’t about to let his associates use the guns so blatantly.</p><p>As dangerous as it was, Kyle believed he had found a way where he could finally come out on top and overtake the Ardent Cretins using the military shipment. However, it was a long plan and required him to buy time. Kyle knew his plan would be feasible in the Galactic Era, but whether it could work here was something else. </p><p>Back at a new office, Damian was visibly jittery, immediately jumping up to meet Kyle the moment he returned. “Kyle, I’ve been listening in on the enforcers so far. It’s even worse than we expected. Nearly every enforcer is up and about, searching the original factory. For now, they don’t know that the guns were hijacked a second time, so they are swarming that district.”</p><p>“And that district is owned by?”</p><p>“The Wretches, sir. Not on good terms with the Ilysian Punks. They probably think that it was either the Red Lions or the Ilysian Punks who turned the heat up on them, seeing as they are still in a state of war,” Damian frantically explained.</p><p>“You seem to have something to say.”</p><p>“Sir, I truly believe that keeping all the guns on us is a death sentence. All it takes is for one rumor to spread and trigger an enforcer raid on us. We should back off now. It’s far too risky.”</p><p>Kyle pondered, considering Damian’s opinion. <em>To be honest, I don’t need to hold onto every military crate, seeing as I can just reverse-engineer them…</em></p><p>“I understand, Damian.” Kyle tapped the map of the sector, smiling to himself as he figured out a plan. “Dump all military equipment, except for two sets, into the districts I point out here. Make sure they are in a slightly visible location, but don’t get spotted. Mask it with food or other items first. I want the gangs to discover them.”</p><p>“You want to frame all of them and spark some chaos with the guns.” Damian nodded.</p><p>“Exactly. We’ll have one set in a crate here in our district as well, just to avoid suspicion. We’ll turn the crate into the enforcers as soon as word gets out to buy some goodwill. We keep the remaining set for our own purposes.” Kyle pointed to the Ilysian Punks–controlled districts, aiming at the closest adjacent district. </p><p>After explaining the plan further to Damian, he soon focused back on figuring out how to push forward his new plan to manufacture the handguns. It was clear that he had to present some improvements over the current flintlock or muzzle-loaded pistols, but he needed to tailor the expectation slightly lower. </p><p>The five engravings that he had added to his upgraded version of the pistol were to make it far more efficient, so much so that even the average human with a bit of arcia energy could fire it up to three times. That wasn’t as good even by Ancient Earth’s standard, but it could be improved over time.</p><p>Kyle was not particularly proficient in arctech engravings, but he could immediately see issues in the flow of energy and wasteful conversion using his former life’s knowledge. The engravings he had chosen would help reduce the heat generated, improve accuracy, and control the recoil. <em>It’ll be a revolution in guns, and I’ll be at the head of it.</em></p><p>He already had a few prototype parts collected from the associates. He ensured that none of the associates knew more than one engraving each, preventing his recipe from spilling out. However, if he truly wanted to mass-produce it, he needed to enlist the help of a factory or two. He began to plan for a few ways in which he could start to dig his hooks into the factory workers. <em>Niko should probably have an idea.</em></p><p>Kyle did not begrudge Niko too much—the hijacking was obviously ill-conceived in a time where they were meant to be lying low, but the potential rewards were too good to be true. He only wished he had more time to work with the equipment in the crate. It had only been a week, but he had only been working on a pistol and barely understood the engraving layout necessary for a repeater.</p><p>He assembled a prototype pistol, the glossy raw metal surface glistening under the arctech light of the office. Just as he finished putting the different parts together, a new system message popped up.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Enchanted Handgun (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 32: Failsafe</p><p>The factory churned with a never-ending rumbling sound. Soot and fumes blanketed the entire factory floor, with large arctech furnaces melting metal and slag drifting on molten rivers. Assembly lines formed as dirt-covered workers moved their hands through the same mundane motions, twisting and screwing appliances before them. </p><p>On an upper floor, there were offices filled with arctech designers, working hard on improving engravings incrementally through every iteration. The owner of the factory at the head of the office made a simple modification to the engraving, passing it down to the next guy, who calculated a very specific parameter before handing it over to the next person. It was like a human calculator, with each designer focusing on one parameter. </p><p>In the middle of this chain was a young man, his eyes clearly glazed with boredom as he barely gave a glance at each of the prototypes in front of him. They were basic household appliances—a simple heated kettle that didn’t require an arctech stove. He sighed as he scribbled down a few numbers on a piece of paper and checked another variation of the same kettle. </p><p>The hours passed slowly, his mind numb from the monotonous work. As he slowly walked out of the factory, he began to wonder why he had even decided to become an arctech designer. Whatever happened to all the cool equipment that he could have been making? Instead, he was some glorified single equation calculator for a fucking kettle.</p><p>However, tonight was going to be different. As soon as he turned the corner, Karl was already waiting for him with a wide grin, along with three other workers from the factory floor. “Ready to party it up, Gordon?” Karl patted his shoulder.</p><p>Gordon was a bit stunned but nodded resolutely. He had been enticed by the raving stories Karl had told about the glamorous casinos or brothels and pubs he had never been to before. They agreed to head over to one of the casinos Karl knew. </p><p>“Don’t you worry, I know a guy in there. He’s the boss. I already got word from him that they set up everything for us. The full VIP treatment.”</p><p>“I… I don’t have that much money,” Gordon stammered. </p><p>“HAHA! Don’t worry, that guy used to be one of our factory workers! Can you believe it? He’s one of the top dogs right now. Here they come.” Karl laughed it off, while Gordon was shocked. A luxurious arctech wagon drove up to the factory, turning heads and eyes toward them as the wagon stopped right in front of them. </p><p>Niko was already in the back of the wagon, beckoning for them to enter. The five of them entered the wagon, which was coated in the most luxurious surface Gordon had ever seen. He had never imagined a simple word from Karl was able to acquire all of this. </p><p>Karl noticed the surprise on Gordon’s face, nudging him as the wagon sailed off to the casino. “Surprised? It’s easy to get into the good life, just like that.” Karl handed him a bottle of unlabeled beer still in its glass bottle. “Homebrewed by the Seven Snakes themselves. We even have our own brewery!”</p><p>“Isn’t drinking alcohol illegal under the ban?” Gordon asked worriedly, having never flouted the law before. </p><p>Karl laughed, slapping Gordon on the back. “Hey, Niko, tell him how many times you’ve been caught drinking over the last two months.”</p><p>“Zero,” Niko replied with a smirk on his face. Just at that very moment, the wagon stopped near an enforcer patrol, causing Gordon to clamp up slightly, trying to hide the bottle of beer in his hands.</p><p>The enforcer patrol spotted Niko in the wagon, and they walked over to the back of the wagon. “Having a good night out, eh?”</p><p>“Of course. Looking forward to seeing you at the dice games.” Niko tossed a bottle of beer each to the enforcers, who simply smiled and slipped the bottles under their uniforms before walking off. </p><p>Gordon’s eyes shone like diamonds at how easily Niko handled the enforcers. He had no idea it was this simple to live the high life. What the hell had he been doing all his life, aiming to be some no-name arctech designer trapped in a dumb office?</p><p>Niko grinned as he caught the look on the factory workers he was tasked with inviting. <em>Hook, line, and sinker. </em></p><p>The wagon soon arrived at the casino, showing them a whole new high life, unlike anything they had seen before. The VIP treatment was real. They had escorts and free-flow drinks tended to them like they were the kings of the world. </p><p>The factory workers naturally got carried away, having what essentially amounted to a free pass on luxury. Gordon laughed and drank with Karl and Niko non-stop, enjoying the nightlife as the sounds of coins and gambling echoed all around them. </p><p>“You see now, Gordon? What’s the point in slogging away in a grimy old factory making fucking kettles with those idiots out there? You’re leagues ahead of them. Don’t you think it’s about time you made your money’s worth?”</p><p>Gordon recalled the faces of his parents, who were adamant that he got a nice, stable job, just like his dad, who worked as a construction worker. But after he had a taste of luxury? How could he ever go back to his boring old life?</p><p>Karl spotted Gordon’s expression and gave a knowing look to Niko, who draped his arm around Gordon with a smile. “If you want, you can have this every night for the rest of your life. All you got to do is just one simple job.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>Two days later…</em></p><p>Gordon was in the office, checking his pocket watch carefully. It was about time for the workday to end, but instead of packing up like everyone else was, his eyes were locked on the owner of the factory while he was pretending to work on something. </p><p>The office began to clear out, soon leaving the owner and Gordon alone in the office. “Gordon, what are you still doing? We don’t pay for overtime, you know.”</p><p>“Boss, I wanted to talk to you about a potential improvement in one of the engravings. Here…” Gordon beckoned for the owner to come over and see, while his hand began to reach for a handgun under the table, hidden from the manager’s view. </p><p>“Sorry, Gordon, but I got dinner with my family. I’ll check it first thing in the morning. Just leave it at my desk.” The owner waved his hand dismissively, grabbing his things and preparing to leave the office.</p><p>Just as he tried to open the door, the door swung wide open to reveal Karl and the other three factory workers, all holding knives, rope, and a crowbar. “Don’t worry about your family, Boss Staten. We got them covered. You’ll be speaking to us for now.” Karl motioned for the other factory workers to restrain the manager down to the ground.</p><p>Staten struggled to fight back against the factory workers, but he was never going to win three-on-one. “What the fuck is this, a strike? You’re never going to get aw—” A solid punch from a factory worker landed right on his face, smashing his jaw and causing his gum to bleed profusely. </p><p>His eyes wandered to Gordon, who only stared impassively at him, showing no signs of helping him. The factory workers hauled Staten onto a chair, tying him down with the rope. “All right, Boss. We would like you to nominate Gordon as the new representative of the factory with full powers. And you’re going to stay out of it. This is a union request. A nice one,” Karl began, taking out a Euria Pipe and smoking it. </p><p>Karl had been paid handsomely for his role in hijacking the guns, though it was a fluke. Kyle was not one to underpay those who helped him, so Karl was now a de facto associate of the Seven Snakes, though still integrated into the factory. </p><p>“Resign?! Are you crazy? I own this fucking factory! You’d better let me go or I call the enforcers on your ass—“</p><p>“Not so fast, Boss. Weren’t you supposed to go have dinner with your wife and your daughter… what’s her name again… Rachel? Cute little girl, nice red hair. Had to shut her up because she wouldn’t stop screaming.” Karl smirked. </p><p>Staten’s face went blank before slowly turning into anger. “Fuckers, what did you do to her?! I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!”</p><p>“Ah, he’s too loud. Shut him up,” Karl ordered the three factory workers, who began to force open Staten’s mouth. One worker held it open while another took out a crowbar and positioned it against Staten’s bleeding lower gum. “Every time you shout, this is going to happen.”</p><p>The scream was horrendous as the crowbar ripped out a tooth from the gum, causing Staten to spasm in the chair. “Stuff this in his mouth. Don’t want the blood to get all over here.” Karl threw a cloth over. “Now, nod your head for yes, shake your head for no. Remember, dear little Rachel is waiting for you. She’s still alive and perfectly well. Assuming you comply, it will remain so. This doesn’t need to get any bloodier.” </p><p>Staten nodded his head vigorously, completely powerless to stop any of them. “Good. You will hand over full authority effectively tomorrow and name Gordon as your new representative. If by any chance the enforcers hear about this or Gordon does not become the representative, you can forget about seeing Rachel, got it? And also forget about your nice home down at Wheaten Road.”</p><p>Karl smiled as Staten nodded his head in acknowledgement while another factory worker took out a Healing Potion and stuffed it down Staten’s mouth, forcing him to drink it. The wounds were immediately cleared up, though his teeth were still missing. </p><p>The next day, Staten held a general meeting, announcing his stepping down due to health issues and appointing Gordon as the factory’s new representative. There was a mixture of shock, surprise, and anger, but Gordon felt a rush as he took up his new position at the head of the office. Just like that, he became the top dog with full power, in charge of designing the products for the factory. </p><p>He immediately fired all the existing foremen on the factory floor and instituted Karl and the three workers as their replacements, ensuring they had total control over what the factory could produce. The Seven Snakes were now fully integrated into the system while keeping a tight blackmail grip on the owner to make sure he wouldn’t snitch.</p><p>Near the end of the workday, a man accompanied by five Seven Snakes members, including Niko, marched in. He had a meeting with Gordon, so he immediately walked to the office without hesitation, glancing around the room upon entering. “Manager Gordon, how do you like your new office?”</p><p>“It’s brilliant, sir.” Gordon got up and bowed immediately, knowing from Niko that this man was Kyle, leader of the Seven Snakes. </p><p>“Let’s get straight to business. I need you to produce these parts for the Seven Snakes. We’ll handle the cost, along with an added benefit.” Kyle handed over a few of the requested prototype parts that he himself had made. Gordon eyed the parts, noticing they were mostly defensive armor pieces with basic arctech engravings. <em>Is he trying to outfit an army or something?</em></p><p>The armor pieces were all designed to be concealed under normal clothes, while Gordon noticed that there were three sets ordered that had a much different engraving style with a note that requested him to personally produce these parts. “Sir, these engravings are…”</p><p>“Proprietary. I will work together with you to make these specific parts.” Kyle wasn’t about to let Gordon learn too much about the new optical illusion engraving that he had modified from Gulak.</p><p>Gordon nodded, still checking over the entire order. However, there was a snag. “Sir, the factory owners are still unaware of this takeover and will still have quotas on the production of other products to fulfill. It would be hard to switch production lines out of the blue, especially when our workers are trained to—” Gordon tried to explain before he glanced at Kyle’s piercing eyes. </p><p>“I’ve been told you are a brilliant arctech designer. The money is there for the taking. It is up to you how much you want to make,” Kyle replied nonchalantly. “Do this well, and there will be better contracts in the future. I look forward to our cooperation.”</p><p>The group of the Seven Snakes left, with Niko patting Gordon on the back with a big thumbs-up.</p><p>Back in the office, Keith was already about to burst his top at Kyle spending money to fund the factory production. “I know what you’re planning, but we don’t have enough money to pull it off! That armor production is going to cost millions at this rate—arctech gear isn’t cheap. Our associates won’t have enough arcia energy to fuel the use of the equipment, which means they might need fuel packs. That’s going to be another money sink… We were just about to clear the Crimson Swords debt!”</p><p>The Euria Seeds cash revenue was enough to offset the debt, but it wasn’t in the tens of millions yet. However, Kyle was unfazed, simply smiling at the frustrated Keith.</p><p>“Circumstances change plans, Keith. And don’t worry, money won’t be a problem very soon.”</p><p>Chapter 33: Auction</p><p>The Central Sector was not free of crime, though its crime was of a higher class. Rather than petty protection rackets and inane extortion, it was here where most of the money laundering, trafficking, and high-value deals were made between corrupt nobles, enforcers, and entrepreneurial gangs. </p><p>In a hidden alleyway away from the grand open streets, two bouncers dressed in suits were dutifully scanning the individuals in line, all of whom wore masks to hide their identities. In the middle of the line was a single man, holding a mundane briefcase that could barely be seen under the night sky.</p><p>As he walked up to the two bouncers, he was searched from head to toe for any concealed weapons. “Open the briefcase,” the bouncer ordered. </p><p>“Sorry, but I’m planning on selling what’s within. I’d prefer not to show it out here.” </p><p>The bouncer grunted in response, motioning with his head to someone else inside. A well-mannered receptionist came out to greet the man. “Intending to sell something for the upcoming auction? Please follow me.”</p><p>The man was led to an intermediate section, where an ornate archway that seemed to be something of a body scanner awaited him. “Sorry, sir. Just a precaution to make sure you have no active arctech equipment,” the receptionist explained.</p><p>“I understand.” The man eyed the scanner but was unable to spot any engravings externally.</p><p>He hardly felt a thing as he passed through the scanner, and the receptionist immediately brought him through the next door.</p><p>The man entered to reveal a red carpeted floor, dazzling with bright chandeliers glistening with oscillating arctech lights. The entrance was crowded as people lined up for the cloakroom, while others simply hung around near a bar drinking cocktails. None of them paid attention to the man with the briefcase. </p><p>The receptionist led the man to a separate section of the place, where it was much quieter. “Please wait here while our head artificer prepares to inspect your item.” She motioned to a small, private room with a table and chair. </p><p>He sat quietly in the private room without making a fuss, waiting patiently while the sole arctech lantern mounted on the ceiling flickered gently. Soon, an old artificer equipped with what seemed to be a magnifying glass in one eye entered the room along with a private guard. The old artificer sighed, sitting down on the opposite chair with a plop. </p><p>“All right, let’s get this over with. Whatever you think it’s worth, it’s going to be at least half of it, so don’t get your hopes up,” the old artificer said with a dismissive tone, his face clearly bored by the dozens of fake or cheap items he had to check each auction.</p><p>The briefcase was opened to reveal an exquisite handgun, somehow carved with an oriental design unlike anything the old artificer had seen before. The design was out of this world. His words stuck in his throat. “This… What even is this?”</p><p>“An arctech handgun.”</p><p>“I know that much!” the old artificer snapped. “Where the hell did you get it from? This is…” </p><p>“I was under the impression that this auction house doesn’t ask questions.”</p><p>The old artificer coughed slightly in a calm manner, though his hands were obviously fidgety, wanting to touch the handgun. “Yes, but it is also under our terms and conditions that there should be no ill-gotten gains that may have been obtained from our… bigger patrons.”</p><p>“Rest assured, this was not stolen from the city of Raktor.”</p><p>“Great! May I examine it properly?”</p><p>The man nodded, with the old artificer excitedly grabbing the handgun and inspecting the engraving on its exterior. The old artificer ran his hands over the surface, finding the grooves and the bolts used to hold the frame in place. Just as he was about to remove the bolt, the man suddenly spoke. “I wouldn’t open it if I were you. I’m told it would not end well.”</p><p>“An explosive failsafe—work of a master arctech designer to prevent others from reverse-engineering their inventions. As expected.” The old artificer sighed. “But seeing as we can’t open its interior, we cannot verify the exact operation of the gun.”</p><p>“Well, it’s quite simple. Point and pull the trigger.”</p><p>“But does the gun not require an arcite fuel pack?” the old artificer asked. Guns were normally extremely hard to use because of their arcia energy requirements. Naturally, he felt such an exquisite pistol would have an obscenely high arcia energy cost. </p><p>“You can have your guard give it a test run. Go for it.”</p><p>The old artificer nodded at the guard, who wore a metal protective glove, before picking up the handgun in case it blew up in his face. Aiming at a wall farther away, the guard pulled the trigger once, firing a blast of pellets that embedded right into the thick wall.</p><p>“Try firing again.” The man motioned, to the confusion of the old artificer. </p><p>“Fire again? Guns like these can’t be fired agai—” The sound of the trigger being pulled and another blast of pellets coming out shocked the old artificer, who stared intently at the private guard. “You’re not a hidden mage, are you?”</p><p>“No, I can barely keep a chest plate active for more than two minutes.” The guard shook his head, himself somewhat proud of himself. The old artificer was in pure shock, his mouth agape. <em>This… is revolutionary!</em></p><p>“Do you understand the gun’s value now?” The man smirked. </p><p>The old artificer finally calmed himself down, sitting back down with the handgun placed in front of him. What came next was the hardest part of the entire thing. He steeled his face. </p><p>“Seventy percent of the final auction price.” The old artificer held up a finger.</p><p>“Ridiculous. You already know in your heart that this gun is an advancement in technology. Ninety percent.”</p><p>The old artificer’s heart clenched. This exquisite gun was bound to be a hit among the nobility. Maybe even Baron Cain might go all out for it, or merchants from other nations might grab it. “Seventy-five percent, that’s as high as I can go.”</p><p>“Then there’s no deal.” The man reached out to grab the handgun, but the old artificer stopped him. </p><p>“Wait, wait, wait, I’m sure we can talk this out.”</p><p>“Ninety or nothing.”</p><p>The old artificer took a deep breath before glancing at the open briefcase. “Those are the pellets, I assume?”</p><p>“Yes. Loaded into cartridges like this.” The man demonstrated the reloading of the pistol, shocking the old artificer once more. <em>Loaded into the grip of the pistol… Simply ingenious. This man is definitely not simple—if I don’t treat him well, this may be the last we see of him. We must keep him around!</em></p><p>“Ninety percent, deal!” The old artificer quickly shook his hand and hastily ordered the guard, “Get this man a VIP seat immediately. He’s an esteemed patron of the auction house now!”</p><p>“Keep the briefcase. Also, a change of clothes would be nice.”</p><p>“Of course, anything for you!” The old artificer was nearly swooning over the handgun, knowing it could sell for way over a million rakels, maybe even reach ten million. <em>This is it—the key item of the auction!</em></p><p>The man was given a VIP seat, overlooking the entire auction hall in his own private booth. A waiter served wine and snacks, though the man hardly ate or drank any of it, his eyes simply scanning the auction hall.</p><p>The auction had yet to start, but there were many members of high society already mingling around with each other, forming business deals and partnerships. The man noticed even a few bishops in the midst, negotiating with strangers in hushed tones in the corners. </p><p>[Good evening, fellow patrons. The end-of-the-year Decaber Auction is finally ready to commence! Please take your seats. This month’s auction has many interesting things in store. Please collect a list from one of our employees.]</p><p>The door of the private booth opened, revealing a smiling, old artificer sitting down next to the man and handing him a list of items. “Good sir, perhaps you might be interested in buying a few things? Also, it would be good to know your name…”</p><p>“You may call me Hawthorn.”</p><p>“Ah, Sir Hawthorn, I will commit that name to memory.” The old artificer nodded, racking his brains to try to recall if there were any nobility in Raktor with that name. He prided himself on knowing almost every one of worth in the city, but no “Hawthorn” came to mind. <em>Perhaps it is a moniker.</em></p><p>“And to whom do I owe the pleasure?” Sir Hawthorn looked at the old artificer.</p><p>“I am known as Master Xen, but you may simply call me Xen.” The old artificer nodded his head before pointing at the list. “Perhaps you might see something that might interest you?”</p><p>“Perhaps…” Hawthorn glanced through the list, noting the huge variation in types of items of all curiosity. Artifacts, historical art pieces, potions, and even slaves were traded at this auction. However, Hawthorn did not spot anything that would help him until he reached the end of the list, his eyes widening in recognition.</p><p>Master Xen spotted the obvious change on Hawthorn’s face, knowing he had found a potential hook to foster a closer relationship. “Ah, seems like there’s something you’ve taken a fancy to.”</p><p>“How much can I borrow?”</p><p>The old artificer stroked his beard. “I personally value the handgun to be a million rakels, so ninety percent would be nine hundred thousand.”</p><p>“You’re joking. The gun will go for ten million at the minimum. I guess I can’t borrow any then.” Hawthorn put the list aside, sighing. </p><p>Master Xen’s eyebrow twitched at being called out like that, though both of them knew ten million rakels was to be expected. “Fine, you can borrow nine million rakels. However, if your handgun sells less than ten million, you will have to make up the difference. Do note that our loan interest rates are ‘competitive.’”</p><p>“Not a problem. Nine million rakels it is.” </p><p>The audience finally settled down, with the auction finally presenting the items in sequence.</p><p>[First up, Item number 1. We have a cyclops slave! Be the envy of your peers when you show off this magnificent specimen, one of the last of its kind.] The host of the auction snapped his fingers, with workers wheeling in a slave cage nearly three meters tall. Inside was a bound cyclops, naked and skin shredded from the numerous whippings to keep it docile. </p><p>[Bidding begins at 120,000 rakels.]</p><p>Hawthorn didn’t show any interest at all in the slave, with Master Xen noting all of this down and trying to put his finger on what Hawthorn liked. <em>If I can get closer to him, I might find the source of the gun. If HE is the source of the gun, I must suck up to him even more than ever.</em></p><p>The auction proceeded as normal, with the items alternating between categories. Hawthorn curiously stared at the stage, as though he were watching an ancient holo-drama from Ancient Earth, where totems, broken-off stones of ancient ruins, and forgotten weapons were auctioned for millions.</p><p>[Next up, Item number thirty-three. An explorer team has dug up ancient ruins in Versia, only to find carved human-sized statues or idols of what seem to be spines. The statues are rumored to be unbreakable, and of course, the auction house did not dare to test that theory.]</p><p>The statues were displayed on the stage, made of rock and what seemed to be dried mud. It looked extremely unpleasant and more like centipedes, and many of the audience members were already thinking of what the next item was, checking his list.</p><p>[Bidding begins at 100,000 rakels.]</p><p>The auction hall was silent, leading the host to feel slightly embarrassed at displaying such an item with no interest to be found. </p><p>[Well then; if no one bids, then it will simply be kept by the auction house. Going once…]</p><p>“A hundred thousand rakels.” Hawthorn suddenly spoke out, raising his auction sign to indicate his bid. Master Xen raised his eyebrows in surprise, adjusting the magnifying glass on his eye to see the items on stage better. <em>I don’t understand… It’s just rock and stone.</em></p><p>A noticeable wave of murmuring began to spread across the audience, with some of the more curious people wondering why a person from the VIP booth would want to buy such an item. Perhaps it was actually of some value?</p><p>Three more members bid in sequence, raising the price to two hundred thousand. </p><p>“Three hundred thousand.” Hawthorn re-bid. Now the audience was far more intrigued, wondering whether the statues had inherent value. </p><p>Baron Cain sat with his entourage in an opposing VIP booth, wondering who the bidder was. None of his peers within his social circle would ever buy something as gaudy as those statues. How in the world would you display them? </p><p>[Three hundred thousand, going once, going twice… Sold to the VIP patron in booth six!]</p><p>“Master Xen, could I trouble your employees to bring the items up to this booth immediately?” Hawthorn asked.</p><p>“Ah— of course, of course!” Master Xen quickly spread the order down, with the centipede statues being brought up into the large booth, mounted on trolleys.</p><p>Hawthorn stood up and walked over, placing his hands on the ‘centipede’ looking statues. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Ancient Exosuit Spine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Lost technology created in the Galactic Era, unusable without thorough refurbishment. </em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active  Nerval Jack</strong>: Enables a pilot to wield the exosuit through a nerval distribution network. Requires an operational exosuit.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 34: Bidding</p><p><em>What the fuck is an exosuit spine doing here? </em>Kyle Hawthorn was stunned, but he quickly controlled his expression, aware that Master Xen was watching him. He twisted his facial expression to one of disappointment, sighing audibly.</p><p>“Sir Hawthorn, is there a problem with the items?” Master Xen asked gently.</p><p>“No, there’s no problem. It just was not what I expected at all.” Kyle took a deep breath, calmed himself, and sat back down.</p><p>The rest of the auction flew past him as his mind raced through all the possible implications of what the exosuit spine represented. <em>The system mentioned that it was an ancient exosuit spine… Does this mean I’ve traveled into the future in some way?</em></p><p>Kyle ran through plenty of possible scenarios, but each one of them did not seem to solve the issue of there being Galactic Era technology on the planet. Some scenarios did have merit in them, but until he gained more power and was able to truly explore the planet’s surroundings, he would have to withhold making assumptions and snap judgements. <em>Ancient ruins in Versia… I must see it for myself one day.</em></p><p>Either way, with the exosuit spine, he now had a good reference to potentially make his own exosuit. Just because he came from the Galactic Era as a crime lord did not mean that he knew immediately how to make an exosuit from scratch. Many humans in the Galactic Era relied on cranial implants to store such detailed information, so it was expected for him to forget while he was here. </p><p>Master Xen tried to make small talk with Sir Hawthorn a few times, but Kyle was so engrossed in his thinking that his eyes were simply glazed over, as though Master Xen did not exist any longer. It wasn’t until Master Xen reached out with a hand that Kyle suddenly violently reacted and entered a defensive posture, assuming it was an attack. </p><p>Master Xen quickly pulled his hand back, worried. “Sir Hawthorn, it’s almost near the end of the auction. The handgun is going up now.”</p><p>“Good,” Kyle replied stoically, resuming his calm demeanor. Master Xen continued observing Sir Hawthorn, aware that the statues must have affected him in some way. <em>A curse? Or perhaps Sir Hawthorn is a non-human in disguise?</em></p><p>[The final piece of the auction is a true rarity, a clear-cut innovation in the methods of gunsmithing, arctech designing, and firearms. Behold, the world’s first repeater handgun!]</p><p>A luxurious cloth was pulled off a pedestal, revealing the exquisite handgun in all its glory.</p><p>[The name of this handgun is Oriental Bloom. Notice the intricate carvings on the surface of its barrel. A master arctech designer has made this handgun, so naturally, failsafes are in place if the owner attempts to disassemble it. However, the handgun is still the first the auction house has seen that can fire more than one burst at a time!]</p><p>“That’s bullshit; everyone knows arctech guns can only shoot once every thirty seconds. Any faster would be a clear waste of arcite fuel or extremely exhaustive on the user. Many guns don’t even have the material required to withstand the force!” one of the audience members scoffed in response. </p><p>The host did not say anything, instead grabbing the handgun from the pedestal and taking aim at a straw dummy target that was rolled out by the workers. In quick succession, the host fired the handgun three times, its recoil extremely high. </p><p>The projectiles blasted the straw dummy into chunks, with a few impacting the auction hall’s wall due to the high recoil and poor marksmanship of the host. Many of the audience members instinctively cowered from the loud bangs before gaping in awe at what had just happened. </p><p>“Impossible…” The same audience member sat down with a defeated expression. However, the other audience members’ faces glowed up, knowing that they had a chance to own this gun for themselves. The prestige of wielding such a gun for oneself would be enormous.</p><p>[Bidding begins at half a million—]</p><p>“One million!”</p><p>“Two and a half million!”</p><p>Baron Cain was already upright in his chair, shouting at his entourage to double-check his accounts and to call the inquisitors. “That gun, it’s too coincidental!” </p><p>He leaned over the railing, trying to get a better look at the surface of the handgun. The carvings were unlike anything he had seen in his life, making it look as though it was from a completely different nation. However, it was too much of a coincidence. Losing a military shipment, and then a repeater handgun appears in the same week? If he did not hold onto that gun, it could be a disaster; mostly for him and subsequently, the military as well.</p><p>He quickly scribbled a message on the napkin, sending it to all the barons of the other sectors that were in the auction as well. <em>I need the other barons to stay out of the way!</em></p><p>In another VIP booth, Sebastian sat with the leader of the Ardent Cretins, Ares. “Sebastian, we need to get that gun! Having that gun will boost our firepower and enable us to have better negotiating rights with the enforcers.” Ares was already grinning widely, thinking about what would happen if everyone in his gang had this gun.</p><p>Sebastian frowned, thinking deeply before shaking his head. “No. Baron Cain is most likely going to go all out for this. I will send a message to him saying that we will not contest it. Acquiring that gun is a death sentence for our gang.”</p><p>Ares was about to protest, but Sebastian shot him a death glare. “We agreed to let me handle the auction. Are you already not satisfied with the proceeds from the slaves?”</p><p>“Fine, have it your way.”</p><p>As all of this was happening, the audience became even rowdier, with the bid reaching fifteen million. </p><p>“Seventeen million!” A loud voice echoed from an adjacent VIP booth, coming from a wealthy gentleman flanked by three guards. Waves of murmuring rippled through the crowd, with those in the knowable recognizing his voice through the mask.</p><p>“Shit, it’s the leader of the Veiled Angels!”</p><p>“Eighteen million.” Another gentleman was sitting on the opposite side of the hall in a VIP booth as well, smirking at the other. The men standing behind his seat were clearly the Violet Demons, their mouths twisted in a sinister smile against the leader of the Veiled Angels. </p><p>Despite them being in such close proximity to each other, neither of them made any moves to try and kill the opponent. Even though they were at war in the West Sector, the auction house in the Central Sector was a neutral zone. The gangs were not about to flout the unspoken rules established by the ruler of the auction house—offending him meant offending the city of Raktor itself.</p><p>Before the leader of the Veiled Angels could raise the bid any further, a clear voice from one of the VIP booths stunned the entire audience.</p><p>“Twenty-five million rakels.”</p><p>Master Xen’s eyeballs nearly popped out of their sockets. He was already shocked when the Violet Demons bid eighteen million, but now the handgun was worth twenty-five million rakels. Xen glanced at Sir Hawthorn’s face, who had no reaction at all, simply leaning back in his chair, relaxing. </p><p>[Twenty-five million rakels! Do I hear any other bids?!] The host was naturally celebratory, having reached a personal milestone. </p><p>The floor was silent, each of the previously rowdy members becoming quiet. Twenty-five million rakels was a sum big enough to buy an entire mansion in the Central Sector.</p><p>Only those of nobility, the barons, could have that much money to spend on an exquisite handgun. As much of a technological improvement as it was, twenty-five million rakels were just too much.</p><p>Sebastian was already thinking of ways he could send men to infiltrate Baron Cain’s lodging to try and snatch the pistol. The same idea was running through all of the major gang leaders’ heads, only to be disrupted by a foreign voice wafting in from booth six. </p><p>“Thirty million rakels.” A new man suddenly spoke. </p><p>Baron Cain was temporarily stunned until the realization of what just happened caused him to crush his glass in anger. “Who’s that fucking peasant in booth six? Is he a foreign baron? You!” He pointed at one of the employees of the auction house. “I want to verify that booth six has enough to pay for this, or if he is just jacking up the price!”</p><p>The host was equally stunned, completely lost for words now, until an employee ran up onto the stage, whispering into his ear. </p><p>[Ahem, thirty million is an unexpected bid. Please hold while our employees confirm that the individual in question does have enough.]</p><p>Master Xen was flabbergasted before pinching himself slightly to assure himself that it wasn’t a dream. Kyle was surprised at the bid so far. “Who is that in booth six?”</p><p>Xen’s back shot straight up, seeing a chance to ingratiate himself with Sir Hawthorn and potentially get into his good graces. “I’m not meant to tell you, and this goes against direct orders, but I know it’s Harrison!”</p><p>“Harrison?”</p><p>“He’s the leader of an industrialist movement in Versia—an acclaimed genius who rose to fame solely on his groundbreaking inventions. And he’s only thirty-five years old!” </p><p><em>Sounds like someone who got his hands on a few Galactic Era relics or ruins. </em>Now that he knew about the Ancient Exosuit Spine, Galactic Era technology having been excavated by locals was a reasonable thought. He would not consider it impossible that someone else on the planet would have the knowledge to operate or at least gleam some inspiration from the relics. “Maybe I will have to pay Versia a visit soon.”</p><p>“If you do plan to, I will be more than happy to assist you in any way you may need.”</p><p>On the other side of the auction hall, Baron Cain was outraged. As rich as he was, outbidding thirty million was not a small purchase in any shape or form. However, he could not risk losing the gun as well. He needed it to trace the culprit, who may or may not have reverse-engineered the technology. “You! Tell me the name of the individual in booth six!” he ordered the guard in his private booth.</p><p>“Sir, under the direct orders of Count Leon, the auction house will not divulge the personal information of any individual without their express permission, including you, sir.” The guard repeated the words like clockwork, but his hands gave a different sign, the baron recognizing it immediately. <em>Not one of Raktor?!</em></p><p>Baron Cain glanced at the other booths, recognizing the other barons who had clearly not bid on the product. <em>If it isn’t a local competitor, then it’s a foreign buyer! I cannot let them have it!</em></p><p>“Fine! Thirty-five million rakels!” Baron Cain placed a bid in desperation.</p><p>[Thirty-five million rakels! Do I hear a counteroffer from booth six?]</p><p>All eyes turned to booth six, staring at the other man, who did not seem intent on bidding again. Baron Cain was even more incensed by the apparent ploy, cursing under his breath. <em>Was it a sham bid? Is it the seller?</em></p><p>[Thirty-five million rakels, going once, going twice… sold to the individual from booth one!]</p><p>“GET THAT HANDGUN HERE AND CALL THE INQUISITORS NOW!” Baron Cain roared with ferocity. “Tell them I want all available enforcers under me to track that fucking cunt from booth six! Send the inquisitors to trace the origin of the sale if it’s a different person!”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The auction house began to clear out an hour later, and the events of the night began to spread through the city. </p><p>Mason and Kitana were waiting in their own enforcer wagon, with Mason puffing his Euria pipe as per usual. Kitana tapped the leather seat under her, impatient, as she stared daggers into the opening of the street. </p><p>[Sir, he’s on the move. One wagon is coming out of the auction house right now.] The arctech radio blurted out. </p><p>“You sure it’s him?” Mason asked.</p><p>[Yes, I personally saw him enter the car.]</p><p>“All right. Kitana, get ready. We’ll pull the car over the moment it enters the South Sector.” Mason grabbed the wheel of the enforcer wagon, turning on the arctech engine. The arcite fuel tank churned as the engravings along the base shaft lit up, slowly rolling the wagon forward. </p><p>Just as they started moving, a wagon came out of the auction house’s warehouse and onto the streets. Mason did not give chase immediately, simply moving along slowly as the target wagon sped off. </p><p>Only when the target wagon turned the corner did Mason begin to pick up speed, staying at a comfortable distance. A few minutes passed without much incident as they drove through the safe streets of the Central Sector, but soon Mason had a frown on his face. </p><p>“This path… It seems he’s heading for the Ilysian Punks territory.”</p><p>“So it really is the Ilysian Punks who stole our guns?” Kitana assumed. “Looks like the tipoff wasn’t wrong after all.”</p><p>“Or it could be a ploy by the Ardent Cretins to incriminate their rivals. Wouldn’t hurt them to have one less competitor in the sector while we’re wasting time,” Mason warned. </p><p>They stalked the target wagon for a good two hours before the target wagon finally came to a stop at a residential building opposite a known Ilysian Punks hangout. Three individuals got out of the wagon, shifting the statues into the building. Mason stopped the wagon just around the corner, the two of them exiting the wagon and checking the surroundings. </p><p>Already, people on the street were eyeing them, with a few Ilysian Punks spotting the newcomers and running off to inform their superiors. “Fuck, this is going to get dicey. Look, find out where those three individuals went. I’m going to their hangout to negotiate safe passage. Don’t want too much attention here,” Mason ordered. </p><p>Kitana nodded, gripping her arctech pistol while she observed the wagon and the building entrances. She slowly moved over without too much hassle, acting calm as she walked past the wagon, checking the inside of the wagon. </p><p>The wagon was completely empty and unmarked, making it hard for Kitana to determine where the wagon came from. She found a handwritten note on the driver’s seat and picked it up. <em>Looks like an Ilysian Punks shipment order.</em></p><p>She decided to patrol around the outskirts of the residential building, entering the alleyway. </p><p>As she cautiously stepped through the grime and trash that littered the floor, a cracking sound prompted her to raise her pistol, aiming at an obviously disheveled squatter who was equally alarmed.</p><p>“Wh-What did I do? I’m not part of the punks! I’m not!” The squatter waved his hands wildly. </p><p>Kitana sighed, lowering her pistol and prompting the squatter to move along. The squatter bowed respectfully, timidly moving past her while taking great care to avoid touching her. As the squatter ran past her, Kitana turned to look at his back. <em>Eyes of Truth.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Skill Activated</strong></strong>: Eyes of Truth</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>As the words repeated in her brain, her pupils turned golden, and the world around her became a matrix of golden lines, breaking down things into their basic components. The disheveled features of the squatter broke down to reveal a handsome young man, notorious as a gang leader. Kitana could see all the engravings present on the man.</p><p>Kitana immediately saw the true identity of the squatter but did not give chase. <em>Optical illusion engraving on the suit—that’s new. </em></p><p>Kitana did not check the building any longer, instead heading out back onto the street to where the enforcer wagon was. <em>It’s clear that they are the ones who made the handgun and probably used the military shipment as inspiration. It seems like they are the ones who have final possession of it. Who knew that a small gang like theirs would have such capabilities?</em> Kitana began to think carefully, weighing out all the possible future scenarios that would bring her the most benefit.</p><p>[Kitana, did you get them? At least tell me you found out who it was.] Mason barked over the radio.</p><p>“I did. It’s the Ilysian Punks. They are the ones who robbed the military factory.”</p><p>Chapter 35: Preparation</p><p>Kyle did not expect to be treated this well by the enforcers when he came in to report finding a crate of military equipment. He also did not expect to have an impromptu meeting with the inquisitors, who wanted to talk with him right after.</p><p>The three of them were now sitting in a lobby area, with Mason and Kitana both smiling at Kyle. “Only a good citizen of Yual such as you would have the heart to return such an important good. The enforcer department will confer upon you a medal of public service.” Mason nodded his head. </p><p>Kyle smiled genially in response. All three of them knew that he was the gang leader of the Seven Snakes—it was an open secret. “I would prefer if I traded the medal for a more concrete benefit.”</p><p>Mason nodded, getting the gist. “Before we come to that, we just wanted to check if you had seen any crates around this district as well. Wouldn’t want to go door to door, banging up people just to find any.”</p><p>“Rest assured, inquisitor, you have my word that this is the only crate you’ll find in my territory.”</p><p>“Is that so…” Mason’s voice trailed off as he glanced at Kitana, who nodded. “Well then, speak.”</p><p>“Word is already on the street that the Ilysian Punks have the rest of the guns. You’ve probably heard about it.”</p><p>Mason and Kitana’s faces remained calm, showing no reaction, while internally they knew that they were about to be caught in some ploy.</p><p>“The Ilysian Punks have recently been launching attacks into my district, and I’m planning some retribution. We’re on the same side here with a common enemy, so I’ll say a temporary alliance is in order. Perhaps we can be of some help.”</p><p>Mason finally chuckled. “You mean you want the enforcers to look the other way while you attack the Ilysian Punks with everything you’ve got?”</p><p>“And as soon as I find even a single trail of any guns, I will let you know immediately,” Kyle concluded. </p><p>“Or we could simply round them up all by ourselves.”</p><p>“Inquisitor, I’m not too sure your men are as willing and motivated as mine to fight against a gang who most likely have full possession of military equipment enough to decimate a battalion. Life is precious, after all. Every death is a stain on your record.” Kyle smirked. </p><p>Mason leaned back into the chair, smoking his pipe again. “A tempting offer, Alvin. Perhaps we are on the same side after all.” As soon as he said the name, he tried to examine Kyle’s face for any reaction but found none.</p><p>“Do we have a deal then?”</p><p>“You have my word. Any issues with enforcement, you may talk to Kitana directly.” Mason motioned to her. </p><p>“Good. Then I shall take my leave now. Pleasure doing business with you.” Kyle patted his suit down and buttoned it before walking out of the enforcer’s office. </p><p>Mason glanced at the figure of Kyle leaving, then looked directly at Kitana. “Are you confident that the target was not him? It seems he knew that this was going to happen, as though he was setting up everything.”</p><p>“We have the handwritten Ilysian Punks shipment order as proof, with a direct mark that can only be placed by the higher-ups in the gang. No way the Seven Snakes were the ones who robbed the factory.” Kitana shook her head, but deep down she knew that Kyle was the one who had made the handgun and was framing the Ilysian Punks. </p><p>“Fine then. One more gang in our pocket is always a good thing. He’s right; it’ll take less manpower now to attack the Ilysian Punks, seeing we have his gang as cannon fodder. We’ll let the dogs eat each other, then swoop in for the kill. After all, the alliance is <em>temporary</em>.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Kyle returned to one of his offices, where Damian and Keith were already waiting for him. “So, did they accept the deal?” Damian asked.</p><p>“They did. We are clear to attack the Ilysian Punks head-on right now without worrying about getting caught. Where did we plant the guns?”</p><p>“We planted them in the three districts closest to us as previously agreed, while the others are still being slowly planted.”</p><p>“Good, we strike in two weeks. Gather the associates; it’s time to do some preparations.”</p><p>The three returned back to the old Seven Snakes base, which was still in use by most of the associates. With the enforcers in a temporary alliance now, the only thing they had to worry about now was probing attacks from the Ilysian Punks. </p><p>“Have we vetted all of the new associates?” Kyle asked Damian. He was well aware that many new members had joined during his trip to the Culdao Peaks, so he was unsure whether any snitches or spies had made it through the crack. It was especially critical now to make sure.</p><p>“We’ve tried our best to filter those we found shady. Many of the guys we took were desperate, mostly through the soup kitchen recruitment effort.”</p><p>Kyle glanced at the assembled associates now. Those involved in the production were not here. However, there were close to seventy associates here. Their gang’s growth was tremendous, with many joining due to rumors of Kyle’s strength and business prowess. Others joined simply for survival or for a place to belong. </p><p>The three vipers were in attendance as well—Monica, Adrian, and Niko. They stood proudly in front of their crew, knowing something big was about to happen. </p><p>Many of the new associates were muttering to each other, this being the first time Kyle had gathered all of them together. “Associates, both old and new. My apologies to the newer ones for not personally welcoming you to the Seven Snakes.” Kyle stood up on an elevated stage, speaking to the assembly.</p><p>Keith and Damian rolled out a map behind Kyle, a detailed version of just the South Sector, with the gangs’ territory clearly highlighted in colors. “In just three short months since I’ve assumed leadership, we have achieved many things.”</p><p>“We have fended off aggression from the Red Lions, fixed our finances, and trained ourselves to be a competent fighting force, able to stand up for ourselves. And this is all thanks to your hard work and dedication.” </p><p>“Look at how much we have accomplished. Can you not feel it? This is true power. Who among you wants to go back to the factories, to the streets, to the thug rackets you used to be?” Kyle inquired. </p><p>The associates and vipers all shook their heads. Now that they had a taste of power, wealth, and authority, who would be sane enough to give that up to pursue a meaningless job in a factory line or to wander homeless?</p><p>“But are you satisfied with what we have today? Even now, bigger gangs look down on us from above. The Ardent Cretins watch our every move. The Red Lions gang wants to keep us in check. And even now, the Ilysian Punks dare to attack our district. If it’s a fight they want, they’ll get it!”</p><p>“YEA!” Niko cheered as the rest of the associates roared in response. </p><p>“Over the next few months, everyone will undergo the same training course. Keith, bring it in.” Kyle snapped his fingers, leading Keith and Damian to haul trolleys full of crates, equipment produced by the factory now run by Gordon.</p><p>“Thanks to your hard work, the Seven Snakes can now afford proper arctech equipment for all of you. The vipers and Damian have been tailoring the equipment to each of your needs. Keep proper care of this equipment; each of you gets only one set. Use every available time to familiarize yourself with the weapons and armor,” Kyle concluded, dismissing them afterward. </p><p>The associates happily ran over to grab their new arctech equipment. </p><p>“My god, we’re loaded! Not even the Red Lions have such equipment. We’ll be legends in the South Sector!”</p><p>“It isn’t about being loaded, but it’s about our leader reinvesting the profits into the gang rather than taking it for himself. He’s so much better than Ulon I nearly forgot he used to be Alvin.”</p><p>“Alvin? Who’s that?”</p><p>“Oh newbie, you’re in for a tale…”</p><p>Despite all their lavish praise, the equipment was not as good as they made it sound. Kyle had gotten Gordon to mass-produce simple arctech equipment that he himself designed. None of the items was good or a masterwork by any stretch of the imagination; they had just one simple engraving on each. Kyle walked toward the crate, inspecting the equipment. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Seven Snakes Vambrace (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>The metal pipe was effectively a carbon copy of Riker’s metal pipe, the result of his hours spent copying the engraving. Despite his efforts, he had yet to reach the intermediate level for arcia etching, partly due to offloading most of the work to the factory. </p><p>Kyle had learned over time that the titles were only granted through repetition, which meant he truly had to grind if he wanted to raise his titles’ levels. But for now, it was already good enough. </p><p>With the factory producing the equipment necessary to gear up the Seven Snakes, Kyle knew they had more than a winning chance to take down the Ilysian Punks, one district at a time. </p><p>Kyle watched the other associates marvel and test out their arctech equipment. Some of them fainted due to arcia exhaustion, unable to maintain the cost required to activate some of the engravings. </p><p>“We will train for a month or two to raise everyone’s arcia energy to an acceptable level. I will consult Haui for any potions that might help with this endeavor,” Kyle explained to the vipers, Damian, and Keith.</p><p>“Sir, if we launch an attack on Ilysian Punks, what if they counterattack and raze our businesses? We don’t have anything left to defend with,” Damian pointed out.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that; I’ve already called for backup.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>In an abandoned mine somewhere in the Culdao Peaks, screams and shouts of fighting could be heard echoing down the long, dimly lit corridors, the rocky texture of the walls stained with blood and leaking arcite fuel. </p><p>Gulak gulped as he walked down the corridor with trepidation. This used to be his home, where he had fond memories of delivering nearly rotten limbs from humans and other creatures to the joyful mothers who were resting in each small room.</p><p>Now, the rooms had long lost their prior splendor, demonized into a harrowing hell of pain and torture. Gulak straightened his back as much as he could, keeping up a false bravado as he continued. <em>That accursed human! It’s all his fault!</em></p><p>It would have been simple to overthrow his reign as soon as he left, but what he left behind in a human female form was far more sinister and deadly than the goblins could have expected. </p><p>They tried to break free many times, but each time the human—no, the monster—stopped them. Even as they pleaded for mercy, not a single word left her lips. </p><p>Gulak eventually reached the source of the screams and shouts, an enlarged room originally meant for goblin children to play together. Now, it was instead a makeshift fighting arena where goblins and humans alike were desperately fighting their hardest against what seemed to be feral mindless humans that had engravings all over their skin. <em>Zombies.</em> <em>A result of Kyle’s human experimentation.</em></p><p>Feldon grunted as he was shoved onto the floor by a feral zombie, the saliva from its mouth dripping onto his face. He quickly shoved a metal pipe in a jab fashion, slamming it right into its neck, with copious amounts of blood spurting out. </p><p>The same scene was played out all over the room, making it seem like a horror movie. Regardless, Gulak was not enraged, nor was he compelled to help. Instead, he bowed, clearly speaking out loud. “Master Sasha, the accursed hum—Lord Kyle has requested your assistance in the city of Raktor. The message says to bring those who are ready.”</p><p>As he finished, a figure leapt down from an alcove in the ceiling, landing onto the floor without a sound. With a flash of her hands, she immediately grappled and restrained each zombie in one swift motion. Some of the zombies tried to lash out at her, but her movement was swift and fluid, as though she was dancing through the horde, targeting each one with precision while aware of her surroundings.</p><p>The humans and goblins let out a sigh of relief, knowing that the training session was over.</p><p>The zombies were not raised from the dead—instead, they were the failed results of Kyle’s arcia engraving experiments, humans who had lost their minds through the intense pain. </p><p>“Finally, I get to leave this place!” Feldon relaxed, massaging his accursed muscles. He had signed up to be a company manager, not a grunt, and it’s been more than two months since he’s been stuck here with his family.</p><p>Granted, he was not treated badly, but the training routine every day was mandatory, making him feel like he was in a military boot camp. It was a necessary measure, however, as many gangs and daring adventurers attempted to raid the goblin mine in order to control the source of the Euria Seeds. </p><p>However, the goblins and company employees that had been slowly gathered over the course of three months were a sufficient deterrent to many attackers, thanks to the training by Kyle as well as the leadership of Master Sasha. </p><p>Sasha clapped her hands, immediately prompting the humans and goblins to line up. There were now more than fifty company employees as well as a hundred goblins, a veritable force to be reckoned with in the Culdao Peaks. </p><p>Instead of speaking, Sasha began to motion with her hands toward a female clerk standing behind her, who cleared her throat. “It’s time to show our strength and to make Lord Kyle proud. However, only seven will join her, as the nature of the mission is small. It is also required to have enough members here to defend the goblin base. Only humans.”</p><p>Many of the goblins were dejected to hear that, some of them previously holding out hope they’d get to travel in a human city. Imagine all the limbs and torsos they could eat.</p><p>Feldon’s face faltered but soon held an expression of determination. “I can do this. Let’s do this! For my family’s sake!”</p><p>Gulak’s eyes lit up. <em>The strongest humans leaving means we finally have a chance! </em></p><p>Just as he began to snicker to himself, he noticed a shadow looming over him. Gulak looked up to see the ferocious gaze of Sasha, intimidating him into instinctively bowing and retreating. <em>Forget it; if we rebel, she’ll only come back and make things worse for us!</em></p><p>Chapter 36: Kidnapping</p><p><em>Two weeks later, at the Lusty Arcian…</em></p><p>“What? We’re expanding the brothel again?” Slavin was shocked, with Keith presenting the numbers to him.</p><p>“We have more than enough funds now to purchase a few more floors. We’ll do it slowly, but the end goal is the entire building. Any problems?” Keith smiled.</p><p>“Of course not; I assume half of the floors are to serve as a front for the brothel?”</p><p>“Indeed, your… beauty school has been quite useful in providing ample evidence for the enforcers to ignore this location. However, the brothel is still slightly under-defended.” Keith recalled the last time the Red Lions attacked the brothel. </p><p>The Ilysian Punks gang was still snooping around the district, and they had already tried to flush out the Seven Snakes from the businesses. However, the increased defense has been able to protect the businesses thus far, so it was not a big issue. </p><p>With the war looming on the horizon, Keith also asked Slavin to hire a few mercenaries just in case of an attack. Even though they were in a temporary alliance with the enforcers, that did not mean the enforcers would help them defend their district or come to their aid in a fight. There was no doubt among the Seven Snakes that the enforcers were more than willing to let dogs eat dogs. </p><p>Keith began to pack up his documents into a briefcase, wearing his suit. Slavin examined him, a sense of nostalgia hitting him as he recalled how young Keith and Damian had been when they first joined the Seven Snakes. </p><p>“Where are you heading next?”</p><p>“Oh, one of the safehouses. I have to calculate how much spare cash we have in case we need to replace any of the new equipment. Why?”</p><p>“I’ll escort you.”</p><p>“No need. I already have two associates with me posted by Niko.” Keith motioned with his hand toward the window. </p><p>“Ah, a big shot now, huh? My little Keith, all grown up. Let me escort you. It’s not safe around the district now with the Ilysian Punks attacking every other day.”</p><p>Keith finally relented, the four of them leaving the Lusty Arcian and walking through the streets. There was a palpable tension in the air as people scurried away or around them. “The probing attacks over the last few weeks have the locals spooked,” Slavin noted.</p><p>“While our defense has been rock solid so far, the Ilysian Punks are not really mobilizing their entire force. They are trying to grind us down and erode the support we’ve garnered over the last few months. It was already hard enough to repair our broken reputation from Ulon’s legacy, but no one wants to get caught up in the wars.” Keith spoke with an air of clarity, having learned a thing or two from Kyle. </p><p>“You know, didn’t you used to dream of being a scholar in one of the top universities?” Slavin suddenly changed the subject. “I even remember Damian saying he would be the security guard of that university which you chose.”</p><p>Keith felt an embarrassing cringe come over his body as he involuntarily shuddered. “Don’t remind me of that! Those were dreams of a naïve boy lost in his own world, oblivious to the workings of the city.”</p><p>“I don’t think it is a naïve dream. Maybe with the gang's help, you could still get in,” Slavin joked. </p><p>Keith chuckled in response. “A Seven Snakes scholarship? That’ll be the day! I don’t even think I want to waste that kind of money on myself.” </p><p>“Or maybe even Kyle might open a university just for you. A pretty good place to launder some money by spending it on ridiculous projects, don’t you think? I heard he’s already funding a professor.”</p><p>“That’s a bit too far-fetched, I think. Kyle wouldn’t—” Keith suddenly stopped talking, noticing three foreign individuals standing opposite the street, glancing at them as they smoked their pipes. </p><p>Slavin also immediately noticed them. It was hard not to—everyone knew almost everyone here in these parts. As for the Seven Snakes, it was their job to know who was going in and out of the district.</p><p>“We need to move quickly,” Slavin urged, picking up the pace. </p><p>The three foreigners also began to follow along. Their jackets flapped in the wind as they strutted, with one of them having his hand permanently in the inner pocket of his jacket. They trailed behind Keith, Slavin, and the two Seven Snakes associates down the long street. </p><p>Just as they approached one of the main junctions, Keith and Slavin suddenly darted into an alleyway while the two accompanying Seven Snakes associates pulled out their metal pipes and approached the three foreigners, who were equally unafraid. </p><p>“New to Raktor?” one of the Seven Snakes associates jeered toward the foreigners. “If you need a map, I know somewhere you can buy it.”</p><p>The three foreigners did not reply, instead immediately pulling out their arctech pistols and firing bursts of projectiles that shredded the outside suits of the associates, knocking them over. “Hide the bodies in the alleyway,” one of the foreigners ordered the other two. </p><p>“Yes, captain.” The other two foreigners moved forward to hoist the two Seven Snakes associates up. Just as they bent over, the two associates lifted their waists up and used their legs to clamp around the necks of the foreigners, grappling them to the ground. </p><p>The suits of the associates were ripped in shreds, revealing a hidden Seven Snakes breastplate that managed to block the projectiles coming in. As the two tumbled and tousled on the ground, the foreign captain did not stop to help his comrades, instead running toward the alleyway which Keith and Slavin had entered.</p><p>As he rounded the corner, a fist came hurtling toward his face. His battle instincts kicked in, and he narrowly dodged it. Caught off guard by the fist, he nearly lost his balance as he dodged yet another punch from Slavin, who had been waiting for him around the corner. </p><p>The foreign captain rolled onto the ground before regaining his stance and pulling out an engraved knife. Slavin’s eyes squinted as he recognized the knife. “So, the Ilysian Punks are finally pulling out the big guns.”</p><p>“Shut it, Yual scum,” the captain spat as he lunged with precision, targeting Slavin’s vitals and organs with the discipline of a military soldier. Slavin blocked as much as he could, but he was no match for the captain, his arms and legs being shredded by cuts and stabs. Despite the one-sided fight, Slavin was still grinning. </p><p>“Smiling before your death? Happy to meet your fictional divine emperor?” the captain mocked.</p><p>“Never believed in that, but I know you’re here for Keith. I’m just a small fry, so regardless of how long I hold out here, it’ll only make it more of a win for me.” Slavin smirked.</p><p>“You make it sound like we only brought three of us.”</p><p>Keith ran as hard as he could, panting as he could feel the cold air of the city searing his lungs with every breath he took. He had not been doing the physical training routine due to his duties with the finances, but he was now regretting not even practicing running. His calves and thighs burned as he ran for more than five minutes at a near sprint speed. <em>Just a bit more!</em></p><p>As he turned the corner of the alleyway into the area of one of the known safehouses, he was immediately grabbed by a burly hand, covering his mouth and preventing him from screaming out loud. </p><p>Keith’s eyes could already see half of the safehouse guards taken out, with the other Ilysian Punks fending off the Seven Snakes’ associates. Niko was fighting off as many as he could, but they were outgunned and outmatched in terms of combat ability. Niko noticed Keith being captured at the back, yelling, “KEITH!”</p><p>A quick chop to the back of the neck followed by an uppercut into Niko’s chin knocked him out for good. “We’ve got the target. Retreat!”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Keith gasped for air as a bucket of ice-cold water was splashed onto his face, causing the locks of his blonde hair to droop down, clinging to his cheeks. He tried shifting his arms, but he was bound to a chair with tight ropes and metal handcuffs.</p><p>He glanced around the room, only to notice a heavily tattooed man sitting in a chair in front of him, a wild grin plastered on the man’s face. The man was flanked by three guards, the one holding the bucket being the same captain that had caught him. </p><p>“Makoa,” Keith muttered, recognizing the sub-leader of the Ilysian Punks. “I was half-expecting Javel to show up instead.”</p><p>One of the guards smacked Keith across the face with a hard punch. “That’s General Javel to you, bitch. The man is a Versian war hero and our boss!”</p><p>“I’m not Versian.” Keith spat out a glob of blood. “A Versian war hero merely means a murderer who killed thousands of Yual citizens.”</p><p>“You!” The guard started winding up a punch, but Makoa stopped him. </p><p>“He’s riling you up. Calm yourself down and remember your training. And as for you, you don’t seem surprised at all,” Makoa remarked as he observed the calm expression on Keith’s face. </p><p>“I always knew this was a possibility.” </p><p>“I could tell from the ferocity of your guards. Too bad they were lacking. ”</p><p>“Just get this over with.”</p><p>Makoa chuckled. “What a brave little kid. You can still work for the Ilysian Punks if you want to, even if you’re not Versian. Both you and your brother can transfer over—as long as you spill the beans on where the guns are. Don’t think I don’t know you guys were planning to attack us.”</p><p>“What guns?” Keith played dumb, wearing a confused look.</p><p>“And here I thought we were on the same page. The hard way it is, then.” Makoa motioned with his hand, prompting two guards to move forward. They wrapped Keith’s head in a rucksack and tilted the chair over a basin of water behind them. </p><p>The water surged around the rucksack, clinging to his face and evoking the instinctive fear of drowning. Keith’s body convulsed as he fought against the restraint of the chair, but the two guards firmly held him down, watching Keith thrash for a good twenty seconds before pulling him out. </p><p>Loud gasps for air filled the room as Keith choked involuntarily. “Are you ready now?” Makoa asked. </p><p>Keith coughed out water but still wore a weak smile under the drenched rucksack. “That’s all you guys have?”</p><p>Makoa laughed out loud. “You’ve got balls, kid. Let me know when you’re ready to talk, hmm? You two, keep going until he’s done.” </p><p>Keith gritted his teeth as he felt the chair tilt back once again, his mind holding onto hope that his older brother and Kyle would come to save him. <em>Makoa won’t kill me. As long as I hold on…</em></p><p>Makoa and the captain left the room, walking through the Ilysian Punks’ hideout. “The kid knows we’re not going to kill him, so make sure to bring him to the brink. If he ever goes too far, heal him slightly and continue. Break his mind,” Makoa ordered.</p><p>“Just like we did it in Versia.” The captain nodded. The two of them walked down a hallway toward the double door. The sounds of cheering and booing could be heard from beyond. </p><p>Makoa opened the doors, revealing an underground boxing arena with nearly ten thousand viewers in the audience, screaming at the fighters going toe to toe with deadly weapons in the bloodstained ring. </p><p>“COME ON, YOU IDIOT! I SPENT MY WEEK’S PAY ON YOU! DON’T LET ME DOWN!”</p><p>“JUST DIE ALREADY, CUNT!”</p><p>The viewers jeered and roared as the fighters threw swings, jabs, stabs, and kicks at each other, battling it out in a bloody gladiator duel. Makoa ignored the spectacle, instead walking toward the VIP viewing area, where five servants had already prepared a spread of food and drinks for him, laid out on a glass table in front of a velvet sofa adorned with scantily clad ladies. </p><p>“What about the Seven Snakes? Most likely, they will try to attack us to free Keith,” the captain inquired as Makoa sat down on the sofa. </p><p>Makoa grinned as he picked up a glass of whiskey, swirling it. “They have no idea where we are, so how could they ever find us? With our observers watching the moves of all their higher-ups, the moment Kyle makes a move himself, we’ll know in a split second. If they strike, we’ll swarm their district in one fell swoop and destroy all their businesses before the Red Lions and the Wretches catch wind of what is happening.”</p><p>“So Keith is the emotional bait.”</p><p>“Exactly. He must not die. We must continue to dangle him in front of them. No matter what moves they make, they’ll lose in the end.”</p><p>Chapter 37: Rescue</p><p>Gordon inspected the new prototype barrel that came from the factory floor, checking the engravings. “It’s a bit rough around the edges, so the efficiency isn’t extremely high. Maybe if we modified the engraving to be more spaced out, that would result in less interference between the traces…” </p><p>He quickly stepped over the mess of books left open on the carpeted floor of his office, trying to find a related text, but not before passing the barrel over to Kyle, who inspected it as well. </p><p>“The rifling is too uneven; the ball projectile would not have the stability I need. You have to redo this barrel,” Kyle remarked. </p><p>“I can do that, but this barrel design is completely different from all the other guns in Raktor right now. I’ve never seen anything like it. Did you design it yourself?” Gordon tried to probe.</p><p>Kyle didn’t reply, instead focusing his attention on the remaining parts laid out on the table. He examined the muzzle brake as well as the stock of the gun, checking their mechanical tolerances. </p><p>Kyle still could not get over the fact that the gun did not have any sort of firing mechanism, as it was powered by arcia energy instead of gunpowder. While it acted similarly to a particle rifle, the mismatch in technology still threw him off slightly. </p><p>Just as Kyle was about to point out a few more mistakes, the door banged open to reveal a clearly flustered Damian. “Kyle, they got him! They kidnapped Keith!”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Who else? The Ilysian Punks, those fuckers! We need to form up and strike back immediately, I’m going to call everyone into the main base—” Damian frantically explained, clearly in turmoil.</p><p>“No. Don’t make a single move. I will call Adrian first to understand the situation. We will not move now,” Kyle retorted, shocking Damian into silence.</p><p>Soon, the shock on Damian’s face was slowly replaced with anger. “What are you saying? Are you telling me to let my younger brother get tortured to hell?!”</p><p>Gordon was frightened by the sudden tension in the room, his eyes frantically glancing between Kyle and Damian. “No, we will save him. But now isn’t the right time.” </p><p>“The ‘right’ time?” Damian’s eyes narrowed. “Why do I feel like you were expecting this all along? Were you using Keith as bait?”</p><p>“Don’t be stupid.” Kyle didn’t reply any further, taking out an arctech radio and calling Adrian. “Did you track who kidnapped Keith?”</p><p>[Yes, but too many of our scouts are being marked by their observers. We can’t move around much, but we managed to pinpoint the rough location of their hideout.]</p><p>“Then we need to go now! What the fuck are we waiting for?” Damian was about to leave when Kyle suddenly walked up and grabbed him by the shoulder. </p><p>“Don’t make any rash decisions; they are watching our every move. The moment our forces leave the district, it’s game over for us.”</p><p>[Damian, he’s right. The observers are tracking the boundaries of the districts, and they have snitches among the locals. That’s how they were able to snatch Keith in the first place!]</p><p>Damian was obviously not listening. “Then we just sit here like ducks? I’m going to save my brother, with or without you guys!” Damian scoffed, trying to slap Kyle’s arm away. However, Kyle’s grip was like iron, crushing Damian’s shoulder. </p><p>Damian threw a fist at Kyle, who easily caught it with his other hand. With a swift kick from Kyle to the shins, Damian was brought to the ground, dropping onto his knees as Kyle continued to hold him down.</p><p>“And what are you going to do when you go over alone? Get yourself kidnapped? I didn’t make you the underboss to be emotionally manipulated. Take a deep breath,” Kyle ordered.</p><p>Damian wanted to retort, but the words were stuck in his throat. <em>I still can’t beat Kyle; what hopes do I have alone against an entire gang?</em> He inhaled deeply, letting out a long sigh. “You can let go now; I’m fine.”</p><p>“Good. There will be time for revenge, but for now, we stay put.” Kyle returned to the gun parts on the table, assembling them with the barrel into one of the longest rifles Damian and Gordon had seen. A weird-looking telescope was mounted to the top of the gun as well, with Kyle peering through it to check the zeroing.</p><p>“But then who is going to save Keith if we can’t move?” Damian asked in exasperation. “The Red Lions? The enforcers?”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>[ANNNNNND HE’S KNOCKED DOWN! CAN HE GET UP A SECOND TIME?!]</p><p>The crowd roared, the thunderous cheers and boos echoing off the walls of the expansive underground boxing arena. It was another rowdy night as usual, with hundreds of viewers and betters trying to claw back their winnings. </p><p>On the side, there were alcoholics in debt, continuing to drink non-stop; hijackers trying to hustle their stolen goods; fencers making connections; and uptight business leaders nervously glancing around with their bodyguards, hoping to get a good word in with the district leader, Makoa, to gain permission to enter the market.</p><p>Makoa was at his usual table in the VIP viewing section, bored out of his mind while resting his chin on his hands. He motioned toward the ring, getting the attention of the coach.</p><p>The coach nodded in response, conveying the signal to the knocked-down boxer, who began to get up slowly but painfully, wincing as he could barely see out of his eyes. The boxer stared across the ring at the jubilant rookie, who was already on the verge of celebrating his win. </p><p>The round proceeded as normal, with the limping boxer somehow being able to avoid a knockout until the gong rang. </p><p>[WHAT A SPECTACULAR FIRST ROUND! COULD WE SEE A COMEBACK? BETS FOR THE NEXT ROUND ARE OPEN NOW!]</p><p>The bookies were swarmed in an instant, with the crowd clamoring for tickets as young boys yelled out the odds. Makoa didn’t care; his attention was now focused on the bound man kneeling down next to the table, his face swollen from multiple beatings. “Enforcer Staten, this is the third time we’ve met.”</p><p>“Fuck off, punk. Kill me and get it over with. Isn’t that what you’re best at?” Staten sneered through the blood dripping down his face. </p><p>A low chuckle rose from Makoa, and the six girls laughed along with him. “Don’t devalue yourself. You’re much more useful to me alive than dead. For now.”</p><p>Staten grimaced, knowing what he was implying. From the view of the VIP section, he could already make out more than two dozen local enforcers as part of the crowd, already trapped in the never-ending cycle of gambling and debt. </p><p>“Didn’t know you punks knew anything about business acumen.”</p><p>“Staten,” Makoa said. “This is the third time you’ve interfered with our businesses. We’re usually nice to our fellow citizens, especially those who keep the public peace here in our beautiful Raktor.”</p><p>“You’re just a gang of thugs. Match-fixing is hardly a proper business.”</p><p>“A matter of perspective. I’m in a dilemma as to how to… change your view of us. No family, no relatives. You’re the perfect enforcer, with no weaknesses. However, I believe I have a solution…” Makoa motioned to a guard, who brought a Euria-infused Stamina Potion stolen from the Red Lions.</p><p>“You’ll never get anything out of me.”</p><p>“The human body begs to differ.” Makoa grabbed the potion and walked over to Staten, forcibly opening his mouth with his large hands. “Drink up!”</p><p>Staten tried to resist but soon involuntarily drank the potion, coughing wildly as Makoa slammed him onto the ground. “Tell me why the enforcers are increasing their raids into Ilysian Punks’ territory!” Makoa roared into Staten’s ears.</p><p>“Fuck you!” The retort from Staten earned him another punch, causing the man’s mouth to bleed internally. </p><p>“Another tough nut. When does the effect kick in?” Makoa asked the guards.</p><p>“Three days later, assuming three potions are drunk in a single day.”</p><p>“Good. Listen here, Staten. You can leave anytime you want. As long as you follow the rules around here.”</p><p>“The inquisitors will never let you—”</p><p>Makoa delivered a fearsome kick to the enforcer’s stomach, causing him to gag. “Your narcissistic emperor and his cronies are not going to help you. Get him the fuck out of here.”</p><p>The next round had begun, with the previously limping boxer suddenly regaining strength out of nowhere and fighting back hard. It was still a close match, but the boxer managed to knock out the rookie just before the end of the round. As the gong rang thrice, the crowd roared in response, no doubt having won or lost their entire lives’ fortunes. </p><p>[AND THAT’S IT FOR THE END OF THE FIRST MATCH. THIS SECOND MATCH HAS A NEWCOMER, AND IT’S A LADY AT THAT!] </p><p>A loud wave of gasps of shock and wonder went through the crowd as an unknown lady stepped out onto the ring from the sides. Her eyes were dead, showing no signs of emotion as people around her continuously catcalled her. </p><p>The lady glanced around the crowd, noticing a few random audience members who nodded back in response. They were spread out among the crowd, somehow inching closer to the Ilysian Punks arena guards that covered the exits of the arena. They all made a discreet sign with their hands, nodding toward the lady.</p><p>The lady then looked up, noticing the VIP section and Makoa’s visage at the edge of the viewing platform. A small tattoo on her neck glowed red, with a clear voice entering her mind like a wireless connection.</p><p>[Sasha, report in. Any signs?]</p><p>[Makoa, local leader spotted. Beginning mission.]</p><p>Sasha stared at the rabid crowd, who were catcalling and jeering her for showing up. The arena was open to all and every fighter, regardless of experience. People just wanted to see blood; who cared who it came from?</p><p>“Did you end up in the wrong place, little girl? Shouldn’t you be in the kitchen?”</p><p>“Where’s your husband? He’s looking for you outside, so go home! You don’t stand a chance here!”</p><p>The jeers barely registered in her mind as she focused on her telepathic communication with Kyle. Kyle had used the Designate Follower skill on her, enabling him to converse with her despite her being mute. </p><p>Sasha did not show any outward reaction, acknowledging it internally. On the other side of the ring, the arena organizers were jubilant. </p><p>“I knew it; she’s driving our view count up! Most of the audience sincerely believes that she won’t win, so they are going to bet against her.”</p><p>A guard quickly reported to Makoa, who grinned widely. “Interesting. Stage a win for her, and send a fighter who can take a few hits. Seems like this girl can deliver a few.” He continued to plan his attack on the Seven Snakes, unaware that the Seven Snakes were in the heart of his nest.</p><p>The announcer’s voice was barely audible in the boxing ring, but a loud cheer went up as Sasha’s opponent appeared. </p><p>[GIVE IT UP FOR MASON!]</p><p>Apparently a popular fighter, Mason was not overtly muscular but had the right weight and body for fleet movements in the ring. Known for his footwork, Mason waved happily to the crowd while the coach gave him a cryptic hand sign. </p><p><em>Losing to this girl? Fuck...</em> Mason internally groaned, but he accepted the job. He wasn’t doing this for the fame, though. None of the fighters were. <em>Let’s just make this an easy loss. She doesn’t look like she can deliver really strong hits.</em></p><p>The bookies were overwhelmed with bets riding on Mason, with Makoa ordering the Punks to match bets on the lady, aiming to sweep up the entire round. It was easy to earn money that way, and Makoa was more than happy with the appearance of the lady.</p><p>The referee lined the two of them away from each other and promptly began the match. The two fighters circled each other as the crowd incessantly cheered Mason. </p><p>“Sorry, lady. I might not know your reason, but I’m here to win.” Mason grinned, side-stepping and feigning, throwing a few probing punches. </p><p>Sasha simply matched his footwork, like a dance, somehow able to keep up with him. Mason was content with this pace, acting cautious, but soon the coach signaled to attack more. </p><p>Mason nodded, beginning to attack more seriously. He threw a few jabs and hooks, while continuously cornering the lady, forcing her near the edge of the ring. </p><p>Sasha only dodged, never retaliating with her own attack so far. This meant Mason would not be able to lose the match as planned. “Stop dodging and fight back!” Mason goaded Sasha on, increasing the speed of his punches. </p><p>Finally, as a single right hook was about to land on Sasha’s face, Mason suddenly felt a cold shiver run through his entire body, forcing him to back off immediately as though he were being eyed by a predator far beyond his means. </p><p>However, it was far too late. Sasha’s right fist was already in front of his own face, the punch landing right on his nose and bashing his face in with a resounding crunch. The force was completely unexpected, with Mason toppling over onto the floor, his hands grabbing his nose that was profusely bleeding. </p><p>The crowd was equally confused by the sudden force shown by Sasha, which did not match her body stature. Before the stunned referee could stop them, Sasha leapt forward and delivered a strong kick to the side of Mason’s head, the bones’ cracking echoing across the ring. Mason’s body immediately went limp as a mush of blood leaked out of the back of his head. </p><p>The sudden increase in skill shocked Makoa, alarm bells ringing in his head. He locked eyes with Sasha, fully comprehending what she was here for. “Grab her now!” Makoa ordered, with the Ilysian Punks immediately leaping onto stage and trying to restrain her. </p><p>Chapter 38: Boss Fight</p><p>The arena devolved into a frenzy, with the audience thinking that the ensuing fight was part of the show. The fence surrounding the ring shook violently, and the crowd cheered on the Ilysian Punk Guards and Sasha. Everyone was here to see blood.</p><p>Sasha deftly avoided the first lunge, parrying with her arm and twisting her body to deliver an elbow strike right into the first punk’s head. An arctech aura burst out from her right hand, increasing the force of the strike and snapping his neck and instantly killing him. </p><p>The other two guards fared no better, being eliminated with precision punches all aimed at their heads. Makoa’s eyes squinted before motioning for more guards to attack her. <em>Who is this girl? Did the Wretches finally send one of their famed assassins?</em></p><p>However, Makoa noted that the fight was not just happening in the ring but on the exits as well, with random audience members fighting against the Ilysian Punk guards. The audience members were well-equipped—arctech equipment hidden underneath their clothes augmenting their strength and skills. </p><p>Makoa quickly grabbed an arctech radio handed over by a servant, barking into it. “Observers, where the fuck are the Seven Snakes now!?”</p><p>[Boss, we’ve spotted Damian at the food market, and Kyle was last seen eight hours ago coming out of the factory, but he headed into one of their dummy bases.]</p><p><em>Then who the hell is attacking us now?!</em> “What are you idiots doing? Swarm them now!” Makoa roared, spurring the remaining Ilysian Guards to move down to apprehend Sasha. He also began to leave the VIP section, heading toward the armory to gear up. </p><p>Sasha exhaled slowly, having defeated the three guards. She could already see the rest of her strike team stirring up a fight amongst the crowd against the other Ilysian Punks. Glancing up again at the VIP section, she noticed that Makoa was now missing. [Sir, target on the move.]</p><p>[The priority is to rescue Keith. Most likely, Makoa will personally guard him.] Kyle replied over the wireless communication engraving.</p><p>Sasha nodded to herself, noticing two more Ilysian Punks, geared with basic armor and swords, charging toward her. She nimbly avoided the first swing, pushing out with her palm against the lower chin of the first punk, slamming his jaw into his skull and sending him spiraling onto the ground.</p><p>A sword swing swiped across her head as she instinctively ducked and spun around in a crouching position, delivering a strong kick to the shin and cracking the bone within. The second Punk screamed out in pain before Sasha recovered to a standing position and elbowed him right in the face, causing him to stagger back and drop his sword. </p><p>Sasha picked up the sword and immediately slashed his neck, moving toward the fighters’ entrance and entering the hallways. As she turned a corner, an Ilysian Punk ambushed her, throwing a punch aimed straight at her face, but she spun to the side and slashed off the arm in one fell swoop, followed by a forward thrust into the Punk’s neck.</p><p>“Who the fuck are you?!” one of the Ilysian Punks yelled out from across the hallway, armed with a repeating crossbow aimed at her. He fired off two shots in succession, but Sasha simply used one hand to lift the dead body of the Ilysian Punk she just killed and used it as a pincushion as she charged forward. </p><p>Before the crossbow user could retreat, Sasha used all her strength to fling the dead body at him. The corpse slammed into him, forcing him to fall to the floor.</p><p>In a blink, Sasha was already on top of him, stabbing her sword in a swift downward thrust into his vitals. She grabbed the repeating crossbow and the pack of bolts, running down the hallway and checking for Keith. </p><p>Sasha assumed that the holding cells were located below, so she took the first staircase she found that led down. However, as she stepped off the first flight of steps, a resounding crack echoed through the entire stairwell, causing the concrete below her to collapse.</p><p>The fall had her crash into a pile of rubble below as the soot and dust kicked up all over the base floor, obscuring her vision. Sasha quickly recovered, instinctively blocking a metallic fist aimed straight at her torso with her sword, which broke in half from the sheer force it was subjected to.</p><p>Another metallic fist came swooping in fast, nailing Sasha right in the exposed ribs and sending her flying into the wall with a loud thud, her bones fracturing internally as her body slumped to the ground. </p><p>“For an assassin, you’re doing a piss poor job. The Seven Snakes did not pay you enough to afford arctech equipment?” Makoa grinned as he moved toward Sasha. Arcia engravings on the surface of his two metallic gauntlets glowed purple and churned as the arcite fuel pack strapped to his belt gurgled away, feeding the gauntlets through pipes. </p><p>Makoa could tell that Sasha had no obvious arctech equipment on her except for the stolen crossbow, which made him let his guard down. However, a sudden green aura surged from the base of her spine, healing her bones and damaged muscles at a visible rate. Makoa quickly lunged to attack, but Sasha was already anticipating it, diving out of the way and performing a recovery roll to get back into her fighting stance in a single motion. </p><p>“What the…?” Makoa was confused, but he was not given the time to comprehend what had happened; Sasha immediately fired off the remainder of the crossbow bolts before tossing it away and charging with two knives previously hidden in her clothes. Makoa raised his gauntlets in a defensive posture to block the bolts, one of which lodged itself in his thigh. </p><p>Sasha tried to dash in close to stab Makoa, but a single swing of the gauntlets forced Sasha to back away, lest she get slammed into the wall again. While she had a healing engraving on her back, it took arcia energy to activate it—using too much would cause her stamina to plummet.</p><p>“Bitch!” Makoa roared as he threw straights and hooks at Sasha, who sidestepped most of them, the two of them dancing in circles on the uneven pile of rubble. As Sasha ducked to avoid yet another swing, she kicked a loose stone in the pile of rubble with all her might, dislodging it.</p><p>Makoa stepped forward, only to find himself falling over as the rubble beneath him began to slide down. Sasha quickly dashed forward with her knives, activating their engravings to slash at the now exposed pipes between the arcite fuel pack and gauntlets. </p><p>The pipes flailed wildly as they were chopped off, spilling arcite fuel that sprayed all over the area, coating it with a distinct smell and color. Makoa landed on his back as well, crushing the fuel pack under his own weight. “URGH!”</p><p>Before Sasha could close in for the final blow, Makoa suddenly aimed the glowing gauntlet at her, which fired off like a rocket toward her. The unexpected projectile caught her off-guard, the gauntlet slamming right into her guts and pushing her back into the pile of rubble. </p><p>Makoa grunted as he stood back up, removing his now-dead gauntlets and tossing them off into the puddle of arcia fuel. “Looks like I won’t have the chance to interrogate you.” Makoa retrieved a match from his belt, lit it, and flung it into the puddle before retreating down into the basement. </p><p>The arcia fuel erupted into flames, burning straight toward Sasha, who was still badly hurt. Makoa did not stay around to make sure she died, instead focusing on his own survival. <em>Shit, I lost my arctech equipment! At least I still have my belt. I have to get out of here, along with Keith!</em></p><p>Makoa rushed down the basement, passing by countless holding cells where traitors, slaves, and enforcers were held. They were all shocked at the condition of Makoa, a sliver of hope appearing in their hearts. </p><p>Makoa ignored them, heading straight for Keith’s holding cell, where the captain and the two subordinates that had been posted to guard him were already waiting for him. “Boss, what’s the plan now?”</p><p>“Give me your arctech radio!” Makoa snatched the radio away from the captain. “This is Makoa Montoga. Get a wagon up to Exit C right now!”</p><p>[Yes, boss!]</p><p>“Grab the prisoner. We need him alive as a hostage. You—follow me. You two, head down that way and make sure every attacker is dead! Don’t let anyone through the fire!”</p><p>The two guards nodded, rushing off while the captain hoisted the unconscious Keith on his shoulder, making a beeline for their secret exit. It was a long underground tunnel that led to an alleyway exit one block away. </p><p>As they reached the end of the underground tunnel, a large metallic door awaited them. Makoa quickly rushed to the door, tapping on it with a secret pattern. However, there was no reply from the other side. The captain grimaced as Makoa gave him a knowing look, prompting the captain to retrieve his arctech pistol at the ready.</p><p>Makoa retrieved a master key from his belt, unlocking the metallic door from his side. Makoa pushed the door outward in a rapid swing, with the captain immediately clearing the room with the arctech pistol. None of the guards stationed there could be found, the room was completely empty. The sounds of rain could be heard echoing down a short stairwell that led to the street level. </p><p>“You, go check if the area is clear. Hand me the prisoner.” Makoa motioned to the captain, who complied with the order. The captain stepped up silently with trepidation, wary of his surroundings. He peeked his head out of the entrance, noticing the alleyway to be completely empty and devoid of the two guards that should be nearby. </p><p>He waited for a minute before realizing there was truly no one around. A rumbling sound of an arctech wagon could be heard pulling up to the exit of the alleyway, with the captain squinting. He spotted the emblem of the Ilysian Punks on the wagon, signaling to Makoa that it was all clear. </p><p>“About damn time.” Makoa grunted as he hoisted Keith’s limp body up, jogging toward the wagon with the captain. The driver was already waiting for them at the front. They tossed the body into the back and hopped on themselves. “Go now! What are you waiting for?”</p><p>“Yes, sir!” The driver anxiously stepped on the pedal, but before he could turn the steering wheel, a loud bang and a subsequent whizzing sound was accompanied by the shattering of glass. “What the fuck?!” Makoa could only say those words as the driver fell over onto the steering wheel, his feet still on the pedal as the wagon veered off the street and slammed into the wall of a building, frightening the residents within. They immediately scrambled to barricade their doors.</p><p>The bang frightened the pedestrians on the street as well, causing them to flee in all directions or take cover in one of the nearby buildings.</p><p>The crash nearly concussed Makoa, but he was quick to recover. He slapped the unconscious captain awake. “Get up, idiot! We’re under attack!”</p><p>“Wh-What?! From where?!”</p><p>“Get out there and find out!” Makoa ordered him, and the captain immediately complied. The moment the captain stepped out of the wagon, however, another loud bang was heard, this time followed by the squelching sounds of brain and meat as a hole was drilled through the head of the captain, his body crumpling to the ground instantly. </p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Ilysian Punk Guard Captain, +400 EXP</p><p></p><p>Makoa was shocked. <em>A pistol? No, a rifle. But from where?!</em> </p><p>He patted his belt, checking to make sure it was still working. Subsequently, he grabbed Keith’s body to use as a hostage and slowly stepped out of the wagon. “I DON’T KNOW WHERE OR WHO YOU ARE, BUT IF YOU TRY ANYTHING. I’LL SNAP HIS NECK!” Makoa roared out into the open, his eyes frantically darting around, trying to find the shooter. </p><p>No one replied, which gave Makoa even more confidence as he started to retreat into the alleyway. <em>This way, he’ll only have one angle to shoot me from.</em> However, before he could step back, a spiraling metallic ball projectile the size of a marble slammed into Makoa, a resounding bang reverberating through the surroundings. </p><p>His belt activated, and a personal energy shield suddenly protected him. </p><p>However, the force sent Makoa stumbling backward, causing him to drop Keith onto the floor with a thud. As he staggered back, two more shots were fired at him, depleting the energy shield and knocking him back even further. The belt vibrated violently as the shield flickered. Makoa’s eyes widened as he realized his protective barrier was about to dissipate. </p><p><em>Fuck the hostage!, I have to survive myself!</em> </p><p>He quickly sprinted down the alleyway and disappeared, leaving Keith on the floor. Soon, the sniper revealed himself to be Kyle, walking up to the unconscious body of Keith and checking his pulse. Kyle noticed the numerous slash marks on Keith’s face, hands, and legs. The man had been whipped till the skin was raw. </p><p>He glanced down the alleyway, noticing he would not be able to catch up with Makoa. <em>Yet another heritage from the Galactic Era. It seems Versia is where I should find my answers.</em></p><p>[Sasha, I have Keith with me.]</p><p>Back in the collapsed stairwell, the two Ilysian Punks ordered by Makoa to clear out the base watched the raging fire. “Makoa said not to let anyone through the fire, but how is anyone going to clear this?”</p><p>Just as he finished the sentence, a human figure suddenly leapt through the fire, slamming straight into one of the punks. “GAH!” The punk gasped as he was knocked onto the floor. Before the other punk could react, a glowing fist was already in front of his face, pummeling him with a severe concussion. </p><p>The first punk struggled to see who attacked him, only to see a lady with her clothes half-burnt, along with burn marks across her face, healing at a visible rate. Her skin was peeled off by the burns, revealing the bloodied, throbbing flesh beneath. “Mon-Mon-Monster!“</p><p>Sasha walked up to kick his head with as much force as possible, snapping his neck in a single instant. </p><p>[Do we retreat now?] The woman replied on the wireless channel.</p><p>[No. Kill everyone. Not a single Ilysian Punk gets out alive.]</p><p>Chapter 39: No Holds Barred</p><p>All the inquisitors could see in the morning was a smoldering wreck of a wagon that had crashed into a building. No bodies could be found, and if there were, they would have been burnt to a crisp, apparently dying after the wagon’s arctech engine caught on fire. </p><p>“The Seven Snakes are definitely not playing around…” Mason remarked as he inspected the scene, which was now cordoned off by the enforcers. The fight had taken more than a few hours ago, with the enforcers finally responding to reports of loud explosives and shockwaves in the area. </p><p>“Dynamite bombs, sir?” Kitana queried. The wagon’s engine was clearly blown out, with the blackened body of the driver still lifeless over the steering wheel. </p><p>“Perhaps. Seems that the Seven Snakes know how to make their own chemical explosives. Either way, we’re long past worrying about guns—if the Ilysian Punks have the shipment, we’re looking at an all-out conflict.” </p><p>“Sir!” An enforcer ran along the street toward the two inquisitors, saluting. “We’ve found the crates mentioned. It’s definitely the military guns that were stolen from the factory.”</p><p>“So Kyle is serious about this alliance after all… Cordon off the entire block. I want every enforcer to scour this area to figure out how the hell the Ilysian Punks managed to get their hands on it.” <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Makoa panted as he jogged down the alleyway, having run more than two districts away. He had not been directly injured in the fight, so his mind remained clear, continuing to ponder over what the hell had just happened. It was nearing daybreak, the glimmer of the local star peeping out from just below the horizon.</p><p><em>Shit! I just lost a raid against assassins hired by the Seven Snakes!</em> Makoa grimaced internally. He would very much prefer to keep the loss of his base and hostage a secret from the higher-ups, but he knew it was a futile effort—they always found out in the end. </p><p>Thus, Makoa made a beeline for the main base—it was better if he turned himself in. As he approached the lobby of a luxurious hotel owned by the Ilysian Punks, the two guards were taken aback by the soot and grime coating parts of Makoa’s body.</p><p>“Stop ogling with your mouths open and get me to the boss.” Makoa roared. “NOW!” </p><p>The guards quickly escorted him into the lobby and into an arctech elevator, which chugged slowly up to the highest floor. The doors slid open to reveal a solely glass room, providing a panoramic view of the South Sector and beyond. The height of the hotel was a mere ten stories, but it was enough to give a sense of awe. </p><p>Makoa shrugged off the two guards who tried to support his arms, walking by himself into the center of the velvet-carpeted room, facing an empty desk and chair. He sat down on one of the sofas, catching his breath as he waited. He locked eyes with a butler who was standing at the side nonchalantly. </p><p>“You look terrible,” the butler remarked.</p><p>“Shut it.”</p><p>“You’d better have a reason for disturbing my sleep.” A low voice wafted in from behind Makoa, and the man immediately stood up and bowed toward the source. </p><p>“Good morning, General Javel!” Makoa performed a ninety-degree bow before recovering into a standing posture and saluting. </p><p>“Relax. We’re not in Versia anymore.” General Javel chuckled, the wrinkles on his old face scrunching up as his face took on a gentle smile. “So, I assume you got hit by the Red Lions?” </p><p>“No, sir.” Makoa shook his head as he watched Javel stroll over to his office chair. “It’s the Seven Snakes; they hired assassins to hit our district.”</p><p>“For what reason?”</p><p>“I… I was trying to find the source of the missing gun shipment that we hijacked. It was last seen in the Seven Snakes’ district, so I’ve been performing probing attacks for the last few weeks.” </p><p>“And let me guess. You follow the doctrine of stealing a valuable hostage to pressure them.”</p><p>“Sir, I did not expect the Seven Snakes to be able to hire that many assassins! They also had a sort of cannon that could precisely target me from far away.”</p><p>“How far?”</p><p>“I did not see the shooter myself, but I estimate five hundred meters or even more.”</p><p>Javel’s eyes squinted at Makoa as he ran his hands over the velvet chair. “That’s a tall claim, Lieutenant Makoa. Five hundred meters is double the range of any known rifle in existence. Are you sure?”</p><p>“I’m confident.” Makoa nodded vigorously. </p><p>Javel scanned Makoa’s face before sighing. “I trust your instincts. Alejandro, how soon can we move?”</p><p>The butler bowed in response. “Sir, we can spare 150 men to attack the Seven Snakes immediately. However, they are the reserves for our continuing conflict with the Red Lions and the Wretches. Tapping into this resource may weaken our stance against them.”</p><p>Javel pondered, thinking carefully.</p><p>“Makoa, you will be in charge of the counterattack force. Prepare yourself. We launch in a month. Continue the probing attacks,” Javel ordered, to which Makoa complied and hastily left the room. <em>Granting a chance for revenge is a simple method of motivation. </em></p><p>Javel sighed as he glanced out of the glass windows, overlooking the city. Alejandro walked up next to him, also looking at the view. “Sir, what are you thinking about?” the butler asked. </p><p>“I’m thinking there is a ploy afoot. I don’t know who the mastermind is yet, but we’re about to enter a total state of war. A small gang suddenly appeared with advanced technology mere weeks after the shipment of weapons was intercepted…It’s too coincidental.”</p><p>“Indeed. The recent auction in the Central Sector seems to be part of this same chain of events.”</p><p>“Who do you think is behind it?” </p><p>“Either the Wretches or the Red Lions. We have been in a stalemate for a year now; no doubt they are looking for additional avenues to attack us from. Enlisting the help of smaller gangs is a valid tactic.”</p><p>“Reasonable. But what if it is the small gang that is instigating all of this? The Seven Snakes—did they not just have a fight with the Red Lions recently? They also had a change of leader.”</p><p>“That’s a bit too far-fetched. They lost the fight against the Red Lions, and a ‘change of leadership’ is hardly enough to pull that gang out from the gutter that Ulon dropped them in. Even if they did ‘win’ the fight, it was only against Wrent.”</p><p>“And yet none of Makoa’s probing attacks worked, and they even hired assassins to rescue the hostage.”</p><p>“I will confirm with Nest on who hired them, if any. However, I am more inclined to believe that the Red Lions are propping them up as a puppet gang of sorts. They are simply scapegoats.”</p><p>Javel frowned for a moment before nodding in agreement. “Agreed. Set up an in-depth defense plan for our front against the Red Lions. Lure them into our districts and ensnare them while our counterattack force deals with the Seven Snakes.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>Wrent’s face was confounded as he stared at the message he had just received. It had been an easy last three months, with his reputation in the Red Lions slightly increasing thanks to his position as the main potion supplier for the entire gang. </p><p>Due to the contract with Kyle, Wrent was now purchasing potions in bulk, allowing the Red Lions to have an easier time fighting the Ilysian Punks and the Wretches. He still remained as a sub-leader, though he was now fully in charge of logistic issues instead of fighting on the frontlines.</p><p>However, the message he received was shocking. </p><p><em>Order from the Mane of the Red Lion: </em></p><p><em>Left Paw of the Red Lion is to attack the Ilysian Punks with all available forces in fourteen days’ time. There has been verified intel that the Ilysian Punks are planning to raid the Seven Snakes with a large force in three days. Utilize this gap to take control of one more district. </em></p><p>“HAH! FUCK YOU, KYLE! YOU FINALLY GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!” Wrent gleefully shouted out loud in his office, nearly jumping up in joy at the thought of his hated enemy being utterly destroyed.</p><p>Sure, the Red Lions had a non-aggression pact with the Seven Snakes, but it was not a defensive one. Wrent would be more than delighted to take advantage of the situation. However, upon taking a closer look at the letter, he noticed it did not have a seal or a mark representing the Mane of the Red Lion. <em>Weird, but maybe Leo did not have the time to mark this properly. </em></p><p>Wrent immediately called his top subordinates into the room. “Round up the men; prepare for war against the punks from Versia in fourteen days!”</p><p>Elsewhere in the district, the patrolling Red Lions squads received the order via their arctech radios, slowly pulling back toward the base. A lone squatter kid eyed the movements of the Red Lions squads before running off into the alleyways. </p><p>The kid turned the corner to meet Adrian, who was already talking to other squatter kids. “Mister, the Red Lions are pulling back to the base!”</p><p>“That means the letter worked. Thank Yual that Wrent is a gullible idiot.” Adrian let out a sigh of relief and tossed a few rakels to the squatter kid, much to the whining of the others. “Stop whining. If you want it, you gotta work for it!”</p><p>Adrian utilized the squatter networks to track the various movements of the gangs, as well as to spoof the Red Lion letter. In truth, it did not matter even if Wrent checked its legitimacy with the main base. It was a verified fact that the Ilysian Punks were attacking the Seven Snakes. </p><p>[Adrian, are you done?] Kyle’s voice crackled over the arctech radio. </p><p>“Yes, sir, everything has been set up.”</p><p>[Good. Maintain visuals of Ilysian Punks and Red Lions. Both sides should be well aware of what is happening.] Kyle ended the communication, leaning back into his office chair.</p><p>“Sir, the Ilysian Punks must be watching the Red Lions’ movements intently as well. With such a mobilization, it will send a warning sign to the Ilysian Punks.” Monica offered her opinion. The vipers were gathered in front of Kyle. </p><p>“Exactly.” Kyle nodded. “If they attack us, the Red Lions will take a huge bite out of them. If they don’t, that means more time for us. Our objective is to stall any major conflict for as long as possible. Every day helps us close the gap. Don’t forget that it’s only been six days since our associates received their equipment.”</p><p>Niko and Monica nodded in agreement. Kyle dismissed them as he began to readjust his battle plan for the upcoming conflict, drafting up all possible scenarios. He then took a tour of the various bases, where the associates were divided up into different groups. </p><p>He spotted Damian desperately training hard alongside them, struggling to activate the arctech equipment while sparring with other associates. “Grh!” Damian grunted as he felt his body screaming out in fatigue due to the low amount of arcia energy his body could hold. </p><p>Damian was the only one attempting to push his limits, while half of the associates were mostly resting, too tired to continue. The original training routine, as stated in the textbook Kyle had, was to expend and use arcia energy to train resilience continuously, but at the rate it was going, it seemed that the Ilysian Punks would attack them before they were ready.</p><p>He had already attempted multiple keywords on the associates, trying to see if the holographic interface he had could help him see their MP. However, much to his dismay, the system did not react at all. Kyle had already long suspected that others did not have the same system as he did, but he was not about to assume that he was the only one in the entire world.</p><p>Kyle decided to pay Haui a visit at his alchemist store, which had its security and layout much improved. The agreement between the two of them had enriched Haui, making him a very wealthy individual. </p><p>As he entered the newly expanded alchemist store, Kyle immediately headed to the basement in silence, where Haui was working on creating new recipes. The alchemist barely turned around to greet Kyle, simply continuing with his work. </p><p>“I need a potion to restore arcia energy.”</p><p>“I don’t have a recipe for that.” </p><p>“You have health potions and stamina potions; why not arcia potions?”</p><p>“Would you like to drink arcia fuel directly? The fact is that such a recipe that doesn’t involve melting of the stomach is one of the utmost secrets of the Alchemists’ Guild, and I myself am not privy to it.”</p><p>“So there’s no way to speed up the training of arcia energy?” Kyle frowned.</p><p>“I’ve heard of mages training in the caves near Tryas, but otherwise, no. If you had enough money, maybe you could buy arcite ore and line the walls with it. I don’t think you’ll be stupid enough to do that, right? Right?”</p><p>Chapter 40: Allocating Points</p><p><em>Two weeks later…</em></p><p>Keith woke up groggily, noticing he still had bandages all over his body as he lay on a white bed. He gingerly touched his face as he struggled to sit upright, feeling the new skin that was most likely the result of a health potion or Kyle’s Necklace of Healing. </p><p>The door suddenly swung open, revealing Damian carrying a bucket of fresh water and a cloth. However, the sound of splashing water frightened Keith, who immediately curled up into a defensive ball—an instinct developed from the days of torture under Makoa. </p><p>“Keith, you’re awake!” Damian quickly ran over, placing the bucket on the floor before reaching out in a hug. Keith instinctively recoiled from the motion, the mental trauma still hurting him deep inside. </p><p>“Sorry… I just need some time…” Keith apologized for the sudden reaction, and Damian nodded in understanding.</p><p>“It’s all right. I’ll be here if you need me, okay? Just call me on the arctech radio if you need anything,” Damian said in a gentle tone and left the room. As he closed the door behind him, his face curled up into a furious expression. <em>Ilysian Punks, you fuckers! </em></p><p>Damian fumed as he stormed through the base, frightening the associates who walked past him. It was in the early morning before their regular physical training routine, but he was already heading over to the training arena to practice. He had been doing so for the last two weeks, training non-stop for the inevitable conflict. <em>If I don’t do the extra work, how will I be strong enough to protect Keith?</em></p><p>He noticed two associates simply lounging about in a break room, joking and relaxing. Their carefree attitude pissed Damian off instantly. “What the fuck are you two doing?! Why aren’t you training?”</p><p>“Huh? It’s more than an hour till the training routine—”</p><p>“AND YOU THINK THE ILYSIAN PUNKS ARE GOING TO WAIT FOR US?” Damian roared, taking out his pent-up frustration of inability on them. “GET UP AND TRAIN NOW!” </p><p>The associates grumpily complied, complaining about how they felt like they were in a military boot camp rather than a criminal gang as their superior stomped.</p><p>However, when he entered the training arena with them, instead of the well-arranged training equipment and sparring rings as usual, it was a complete mess, with multiple other associates grabbing arcite ore and placing it around the room. </p><p>Dozens of arcite ore sacks were stacked in the corner of the room, with Kyle directing the associates around. There were even a few mini caves of densely packed arcite ore, where a few associates were stuffed inside its cramped interior, apparently practicing their arcia energy. It felt like a mine, albeit with cubicles of arcite ore, making for a bizarre scene out of this world. If Damian did not know better, he would have assumed he had been transported to a mountain of sorts.</p><p>“Wh… What’s going on?” Damian was surprised, losing his prior anger in confusion. He also noticed a small midget in a cloak next to Kyle, who seemed to be giving Kyle advice on the proper placement.</p><p>“I’m improving our training conditions,” Kyle replied without turning back.</p><p>“Lord Kyle, put more arcite ore here. The flow is not right! Here!” the small midget exclaimed in a growling and broken accent, making Damian curious as to who this newcomer was. </p><p>The midget turned around to reveal a goblin’s face, shocking Damian. “What?! You brought it from the Culdao Peaks?”</p><p>“I had to. Gulak has experience making such a chamber. I’m sure it will do a good job, isn’t that right, Gulak?” Kyle smiled.</p><p>“Yes, yes, of course!” Gulak nodded vigorously, having already been reminded clearly of both Kyle’s and Sasha’s strength. If the chamber was ill-designed, Gulak knew there would be immediate punishment not only for it but for the rest of its tribe. </p><p>“Damian, we need more arcite ore. Buy some from the workshops or factories nearby.”</p><p>Damian’s mouth was already agape at the amount of ore being layered into the room. “We need more?! This is already close to a few million rakels!”</p><p>“Yes. Buy another few million rakels’ worth.”</p><p>“But that will bring our surplus down immensely!” </p><p>“Money isn’t meant to be hoarded indefinitely. Do you want to get stronger or not?”</p><p>Damian was about to retort but decided against it. Kyle was correct; there was no point hoarding when there was an imminent conflict with the Ilysian Punks on the horizon. If he wanted to have a shot at getting proper revenge, they had to pull out all the stops. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>Kyle observed the rest of the operation as more and more arcite ore was layered in. The training room was starting to look more like a naturally formed cave than anything else. He glanced at Gulak, who currently had its eyes closed, apparently trying to feel the flow of arcia energy.</p><p>Damian dutifully brought back the extra arcite ore, completing the chamber. Gulak nodded in satisfaction. “Yes, yes. This is the same as our chamber! It is how we do holy tattoos!”</p><p>Kyle’s eyes squinted, realizing something he had missed while he was in the Culdao Peaks. He had performed the engraving on the slaves in their respective rooms rather than the dedicated arcia chamber. “So, the success of engraving depends on the environment?”</p><p>“Yes, more arcia in air, more power and easier!” Gulak nodded. </p><p>“Engraving? Like engraving objects?” Damian queried, still unaware of what Kyle exactly did in the Culdao Peaks. </p><p>[Sasha, come here.] Kyle used his direct communication channel via the Designate Follower skill. </p><p>Sasha immediately entered the chamber, saluting Kyle. “Spar with Damian. Use all engravings.”</p><p>[Yes, sir.]</p><p>“What? What engravings?” Damian was still utterly confused, not seeing any form of arctech equipment on Sasha. Without warning, Sasha threw a high kick at Damian, who instinctively blocked it with his arm. </p><p>In a fluid combo, Sasha delivered three to five hits, with Damian blocking in a defensive posture with his forearms. <em>Her hits are nothing special. I don’t see what Kyle is talking abo—</em></p><p>Suddenly, Sasha’s right fist glowed under its bandage as she threw a straight punch. The resulting force sent Damian stumbling back, knocking him off balance. With a sweeping kick, Damian found himself hitting the ground hard, staring at the ceiling now lined with arcite ore.</p><p>“You… You have arctech engravings on your body? But how?!” Damian finally realized what was going on, but his mind could not figure out how it was possible when Sasha wasn’t a mage like Theorin was. </p><p>He was not an expert on arctech design or use of arcia energy, but he had a sinking feeling that this engraving was the key to his advancement in combat strength. “Again!” Damian jumped up to his feet, preparing to spar with Sasha again. </p><p>Kyle did not stay to watch the two of them spar, leaving the chamber with Gulak. He led the goblin to another room, where Monica was handling prototype handguns that were handcrafted by the ten associates and assembled by Kyle. Only the vipers would be allowed to use the handguns, as Kyle did not want them to be too obvious. </p><p>However, there was still a surplus of two hundred handguns laid out on a table. More was being produced daily, though Kyle was not planning to get the factory completely involved. While Monica was inspecting each of them, she nodded at Kyle’s arrival. </p><p>“I need the two of you to work together on this job. For every ten handguns, distribute eight handguns to as many weapon dealers as possible. Don’t let them find out that you’re Seven Snakes. In fact, it would be even better if Gulak did the sale.”</p><p>“How much do you want them sold for?”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. The objective is to get as many guns out there into the sector. Flood the market. If you have to give them away for free, do it.”</p><p>“What if they reverse-engineer it?”</p><p>“They won’t be able to immediately; I have a failsafe built into them. The smarter ones will figure out its underlying principles even if we don’t sell them.” Kyle knew Baron Cain most likely had already hired men to take a look at the handgun. Technological progress surged like a raging tide whenever a proof of concept appeared, pushing the boundaries. </p><p>Monica frowned. “What do we do with the remaining handguns?”</p><p>“Stash them deep and put them in a thick metal safe. As deep as you can find. Somewhere no arctech radio signal can reach. When Keith makes a full recovery, get him to find a suitable location. Under no circumstances can the enforcers find that stash.”</p><p>“You got it. But if all of these get traced back to us, we’re dead.”</p><p>“You let me worry about that part. Gulak, before you go, did you bring the knife?”</p><p>Gulak obediently presented a knife wrapped in a cloth to Kyle. </p><p>Kyle gave them a few more minor orders before returning to his office. On his table lay two other items—the sniper railgun he had used to attack Makoa and the ancient exosuit spines. </p><p>Now that Kyle had a method of improving the training rate of the associates, it was time to figure out how he could boost himself even more. He checked his statistics again.</p><p>The titles had been extremely useful to him so far, as well as the class skills and the mana points. However, he had yet to check out the Strength or Dexterity stats. With no description of the stats, he was unable to determine what they related to. </p><p><em>The stats seem to be exponential in nature…</em> Kyle surmised, as he had been gaining stats with every level-up, but it did not feel like a linear power-up. He could clearly tell he was significantly stronger than he was when he first arrived, especially with the increase in MP. The Charisma stat seemed to slightly affect his looks as well, but did not increase with levels. </p><p>He also noted he had a lot of free points from the level-ups, but he had been holding on to them due to his reluctance to rely too much on the system. <em>If the class selection was any indication, if I dumped all my free points into a specific stat, it would most likely be extremely painful. </em></p><p>There was no doubt that for the upcoming fight, he would need everything he could get his hands on. Kyle decided to put all his free points into strength, dexterity, and vitality.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Information</strong>: Free Points Allocated</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle felt a slight surge trickle through his muscles, a rejuvenating effect coming over him. It wasn’t much at all, which was a bit underwhelming to him. He clenched his fist, testing his new strength, but he felt only a little stronger than he had been before.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">* * *</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>The stats in the system are far too unreliable. </em>Kyle shook his head in disappointment, thinking about what had just happened. He had tested them before, right after killing Ulon.</p><p><em>My class upgrade was painful and lasted almost ten hours, yet seventy points of stats did not do much of anything. What is the difference?</em></p><p>Before Kyle could contemplate any further, a Seven Snakes associate knocked on the door. “Sir, I think you should head to the new arcite training chamber. You need to stop them!”</p><p>“Stop them?” Kyle was confused, quickly leaving the office and heading over.</p><p>In the training ring, Damian was desperately throwing jabs and hooks at Sasha, who nimbly dodged and twisted her body, avoiding the slow punches. The spar looked more like a mockery, where Sasha barely seemed to make any effort to move around. </p><p>On the other side, Damian was fighting hard to even keep up, sweat and blood covering his face with bruises on his body. The associates could only stand at the side and watch as their underboss gritted through the pain, pushing through with sheer determination. Despite him clearly being on the losing end, his undying perseverance ignited a burning sense of pride and respect among those under him. </p><p>Even Sasha was amazed at the vitality of Damian and the number of punches that Damian was able to endure, her own knuckles beginning to throb from the non-stop hits. <em>Is this the power of siblings?</em> Sasha wouldn’t know—she had been torn away from her family for so many years. </p><p>While Sasha was in an introspective mood, Damian’s eyes glinted as he spotted an opening. He let out a loud roar before throwing a straight punch at her face. In a blink, Sasha grappled the arm and flung him overhead by using her body as a pivot, slamming him back first into the ground. </p><p>“Fu… FUCK! AGAIN!” Damian bellowed as he got straight up, unfazed by the sudden defeat and getting into a fighting stance again. Sasha nodded and continued the spar, respecting Damian’s tenacity.</p><p>The same result was repeated over and over again, but Damian gritted his teeth and kept trying. However, no matter what strategy he tried to use, he could not beat the lady or land a single punch on her. <em>Is this all my training has amounted to over the last three months?!</em></p><p>The engraving on Sasha’s right hand glowed again, prompting Damian to avoid the hit. However, Sasha followed it up again with rapid activations, showing her prowess in using the engravings to augment her combat style. The fist landed on his forearm, nearly cracking his arm and sending him sprawling onto the ground again for the umpteenth time.</p><p>Damian cursed to himself as he winced and doubled over. <em>How the fuck am I to protect Keith when I am this weak?!</em> </p><p>“Enough.” Kyle’s voice wafted over the rocky chamber as he entered. “You’re far too driven by anger to train properly. You keep repeating the same mistakes over and over. How long do you want Sasha to keep beating you up? Days?”</p><p>Damian gritted his teeth and clenched his fist. “I need to be stronger. I will do anything to be stronger! Kyle, give me the engravings too!” He had seen over the course of his sparring with Sasha just how effective they could be.</p><p>Kyle frowned. “The process is extremely dangerous. The chamber we have now may increase the success rate, but you might die or lose your mind.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. I might as well be dead at my current strength!”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Damian nodded with determination, his eyes feisty and driven. </p><p>Kyle did not try to convince Damian otherwise anymore. It would be a good thing if Damian became stronger as well. “Sasha, clear out the room and prepare for the procedure.”</p><p>[Yes, sir.]</p><p>The chamber was cleared of associates, leaving only Damian on a surgery table of sorts while Kyle and Sasha prepared the necessary equipment. Sasha strapped all of Damian’s limbs to the table, preventing him from any movement. Kyle unveiled the Taboo Knife, polishing its edge slightly with a grinding stone. </p><p>“Do you want the same force engraving?”</p><p>“No, give me a defensive one.” Damian shook his head. He knew his body was not fast enough to perform counterattacks, so it was better to play a more defensive role. “One that can block bullets.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>In a food market on the far side of the South Sector…</em></p><p>An armored man weaved through the dense crowds, packed like sardines in an underground bazaar, a sleazy atmosphere thick with Euria smoke assaulting his nose. </p><p>The sound of metal armor clinking was drowned out by the din of the crowd as dealers sold all sorts of exotic goods and illegal weapons. He shoved his way through, with the crowd actively avoiding his gaze as though he were a god. </p><p>“Kaya butter, straight from Proco! Exotic taste unlike anything you have tried here before in your life guaranteed!”</p><p>“Nest is recruiting mercenaries—sign up today and get a sign-on bonus. Multiple slots available in Versia!”</p><p>“Behold! Fifteen handguns of the highest quality here. Don’t think they are anything like your usual arctech pistols—these babies can shoot up to three times in a row, even if you’re a normal human!” </p><p>That callout attracted the attention of everyone. The crowd gathered around the stall was amazed, whispering frantically among one another. Small-time bandits, criminals, and other thugs all jostled with one another to get a better look at the weapons. </p><p>“Limited availability, yours for only sixty thousand rakels!”</p><p>“Sixty thousand rakels?! That’s a rip-off! Might as well buy an arcite fuel pack with that cost!” one of the thugs yelled from the side. </p><p>“I’ll buy it!” A smuggler grinned and grabbed a handful of rakels out of his hands, handing them over to the dealer. </p><p>“Deal! Pleasure doing busine—” Before the dealer could hand over the gun, the crowd was physically shoved apart by the armored man. </p><p>“This stall is now closed. Move along.” The armored man spoke with clear authority, a monotone voice rumbling from the metal.</p><p>Immediately, the crowd began to disperse, many not willing to contest him except for the smuggler who had just paid. “HEY! I PAID HIM; IT’S MY GUN! WHO ARE YOU TO—”</p><p>Before the smuggler could finish his words, the armored man grabbed the smuggler by the head and slammed him onto the ground, finishing the man off with a swift step to the neck, which easily cracked it open. </p><p>The dealer was frightened, his heart palpitating as he tried to make a run for it. <em>Fuck, fuck, fuck! I can’t get caught by the guards of this black market!</em></p><p>However, the armored man grabbed his shoulder in an instant, delivering a punch to the face that knocked him out immediately. Retrieving the arctech radio slung by his side, he tuned the channel before speaking into it.</p><p>“Report. I’ve spotted handguns entering the black market. Put me through to Baron Cain.”</p>
