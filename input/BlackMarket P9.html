<p></p><p><strong>Chapter 120 - Hunters</strong></p><p>&quot;Hunting in the Keru Forest? You'll need more than a few Tusken Rabbits to sustain us, and that's just for a day.&quot; Diya complained while Kyle, Sasha, and Feldon geared up. &quot;Everything else is larger than the Tusken Rabbit or too poisonous for humans to eat!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then we'll hunt the bigger creatures.&quot; Kyle continued his work at the arcia etcher without looking back at Diya. He was confident that there existed such a food source, especially with the large animal tracks that he had spotted.</p><p>Diya still wasn't convinced about the feasibility of the plan. &quot;You can't be serious, taking down a single mammoth hog is a task for the military. Just five of you won't be enough - you'll need all of us to maybe even hurt one. Not to mention that they travel in herds and always group up when they are under attack.&quot;</p><p>Kyle cocked an eyebrow as he gave a sidelong glance at the frustrated Diya. &quot;Good to hear. We'll keep that in mind, but I can't have all the Ghosts leave the refugee camp together. I'm counting on you to hold down the fort.&quot;</p><p>Diya was about to retort once more but recalled Kyle's warning before, stopping herself before she landed in more trouble. &quot;Fine. Do it your way. But if you come back for help, don't say I didn't warn you.&quot; She turned around sharply, her dress fluttering in the air as she made for the exit ladder.</p><p>As Diya left, Feldon shuffled over to Kyle's side, whispering through the side of his mouth. &quot;Sir, are you sure you should be pissing off the local Ghost leader like that? She is a local of Desham, after all; I would rather have her on our side than plotting against us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What she does against us means little in the grand scale of things. Anyone who stands against me will be swiftly dealt with, that's all.&quot; Kyle wasn't in the mood to entertain Feldon's doubt, though he was well aware that pushing Diya too hard might cause her to change sides. Yet from his observations of Diya's behavior, Kyle was confident that she would not turn over to the guards. <em>Judging from her interaction with Jaden, she is morally aligned with the goal of the Ghosts. If she were truly a pragmatic black market dealer, she should have sided with the guards instantly.</em></p><p>A real black market dealer would have had Jaden shaken down for all his worth on top of that necklace. <em>The necklace itself was a fake, yet Diya offered two sacks. She's too good for her own sake to even think of turning to the enemy.</em></p><p>Within an hour, Kyle and the squad were geared up once more, Kyle returning the runic falchion to Sasha, albeit with the blade sung a little from the friction with Soren's lightning sword. He left Nox's helmet and Soren’s lightning sword behind in a locked crate, still wearing the exosuit arm and bringing a railgun along with a simple standard machete taken from the stockpile of equipment that had been evacuated. Potions, rations, water flasks, and antidotes were all stocked up as well, just barely enough for the five of them. The supplies were running thin, but Kyle knew that food was the most pressing issue right now - bartering jewelry and using them to bribe the guards is hardly a sustainable method to fuel a rebel movement. Once he was ready, the squad formed up behind him, armed to the teeth with proper armor. &quot;Let's move.&quot; Kyle motioned with his hand.</p><p>[Sir, perhaps we should gather more information on the mammoth hog that we are to hunt. Right now we're completely in the blind as to where the herd could be.] Sasha gave her opinion as they headed up the exit ladder out of the hideout. [The Keru Forest is almost five hundred kilometers wide at its shortest width - we may be stuck hunting for days or even weeks.]</p><p>&quot;Don't worry about it. Someone will come to help us.&quot; Kyle gave a cryptic reply, Sasha cocking her head in confusion.</p><p>As luck would have it, there was someone waiting right outside the shelter, the youth Jaden twirling a tenar coin between his fingers expertly as he squatted on the side of the dusty street, chewing on a yellowing grass stem. He stood straight up the moment Kyle and the squad stepped out, blocking Kyle's path. &quot;Name's Jaden, heard you needed help hunting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And where did you hear that from?&quot; Kyle asked, his senses alerted to the environment. From the corner of his peripheral vision, he could see a tinge of Diya's purple satin dress peeking out from the side of another shelter further down, hiding amidst the hustle and bustle of other refugees loitering about.</p><p>&quot;Heard it from Diya.&quot; Jaden tried to act tough, though it only increased his chewing speed. &quot;I know the grazing pattern of the mammoth hogs. There's a few hundred herds, but I reckon one herd is more than enough to feed this entire refugee camp.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's in it for you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just because I know where they are, doesn't mean I can hurt them.&quot; Jaden stretched his arms out, showing his lanky skinny frame off. &quot;I got the tracks, you got the weapons and warriors. We can cut the meat fifty-fifty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Five.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Five...? You want to kill five mammoth hogs? That's a bit too much, isn't it? I thought we were killing -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Five percent. That's all you get.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha...&quot; Jaden's jaw dropped before he closed his gaping mouth and glared at Kyle. &quot;How the hell is that fair? I'm the one who knows where the hog is!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I'm the one who is going to kill it. If you're not agreeable, we can talk again when I return.&quot; Kyle signaled to the squad, all of them walking off down the street toward the end of the refugee camp. There were hardly any guards in the refugee camps, all of them having been delegated to the defense of the walls and gates of the inner city zone, allowing Kyle and his Ghosts to move freely enough.</p><p>Jaden didn't expect Kyle to really walk away like that without haggling. <em>Shit, I need that meat!</em> He quickly ran up to Kyle, blocking his path once more with his arms outstretched. &quot;Okay, okay, forty-sixty! That's as low as I'm willing to -&quot;</p><p>The tip of a drawn machete pressed against his chin, Jaden's eyes not even being able to catch the speed at which Kyle drew the blade out. Even Sasha and Feldon were caught off-guard by the fluidity of the motion, having no knowledge about Kyle's racial upgrade to a 229-A-X package. &quot;Block my path one more time with a useless offer, and Diya will be left with a head. Five or dead. Choose.&quot; Kyle sternly warned the flustered Jaden, who had his hands raised in surrender.</p><p>&quot;F-f-five! Five! I agree to five!&quot;</p><p>Kyle retracted the machete, flicking it before sheathing again along the back of his belt. &quot;Always good to do business with someone smart. Lead the way.&quot;</p><p>Jaden nodded vigorously but internally cursed at being threatened this much. Still, his stomach could only think about the five percent that he was about to receive in meat. <em>With that much being offered, I'm going to be rich in the refugee camp - I could even have servants!</em> The slowly growing grin on his face showed the greed under the surface as he led Kyle's squad out of the refugee camp.</p><p>The Keru Forest was relatively close to the outskirts of Desham, and it took only half an hour of walking to reach the border of the forest. Already, the giant trees of the forest beyond stood far taller than the pitiful stone walls that surrounded Desham, the trees' trunks and dense foliage limiting the daylight that filtered through the leaves in streams. A single major road led into the forest, winding deeper in. Interestingly enough, checkpoints for passing wagons going in and out of the Keru Forest were set up by Nest guards, inspecting countless wagons plastered with the logo of Harrison Industries that carried large planks of wood, escorted by armed personnel towards the factories of Desham. The military presence of Nest guards dissuaded any refugee who even thought of hijacking the wagon convoys. Large swaths of stumps showed the former border of the forest, already being steadily chopped down by arctech saws that ground against the ancient barks.</p><p>Instead of taking the major road where there was consistent traffic, Jaden led them onto a smaller path that was less traveled and far away from the view of the Nest guards. &quot;Don't want to get too close to those guys. Ever since the President declared martial law, they've been coming in and forcibly evacuating villages from the forest just so they can take over the land.&quot; Jaden explained in a low, somber tone to Kyle as they entered the forest through another track, this one barely showing any signs of human presence.</p><p><em>So Harrison Industries has been exploiting the forest too.</em> Kyle expected Harrison to do so - the wood in the Keru Forest was extremely useful for plenty of things such as creating weapons, barricades and providing temporary housing as well as serving as firewood. However, none of the refugees in the camps of Desham were benefitting from this exploitation, many still living in tattered tents that barely offered any protection from the elements.</p><p>&quot;We'll need to find a place to set up camp. Hunting the mammoth hog won't be easy - it'll take days of tracking and patience to even get the scent of one. There is a village deeper in the Keru Forest nearby that can help serve as a base point.&quot; Jaden pointed towards a rickety old arrow sign that pointed along a winding forest track marked by piles of dead leaves recently brushed aside; the words on the sign faded from erosion.</p><p>&quot;I thought you mentioned that the villages were being evacuated by Harrison Industries.&quot; Feldon questioned as they continued walking.</p><p>&quot;Well, this one is a bit harder to find. I doubt Harrison Industries would try anything with us.&quot; Jaden shrugged.</p><p>&quot;Us?&quot; Kyle asked.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I uhh... yea I'm part of the village.&quot; Jaden rubbed his head sheepishly, clearly hiding something else and raising Kyle's suspicion.</p><p>[Sasha, take a high route and watch for any imminent traps.] Kyle spoke to Sasha through the telepathic channel.</p><p>[Understood, but if we suspect that it's a trap, then why are we still following him?]</p><p>[Great rewards always come with great risks.] Kyle motioned with his finger, signaling to his Ghosts to get ready for an ambush, while Sasha leaped upwards without much of a sound, climbing up the great ancient trees and using their branches.</p><p>Interestingly, Jaden heard the sounds, turning around and looking up, though he could not see anything. &quot;Weird, haven't heard anything like that around...&quot; He mumbled, having forgotten to count the number of Ghosts following Kyle.</p><p>They continued walking, Kyle keeping a keen eye out for any signs of an attack. To him, any place with a human population meant they could either be recruited or subjugated - either of which was always a boon to him. <em>I could certainly do with more Ghosts. If they are unwilling, then I could do with more slaves.</em></p><p>Furthermore, he already had plans to expand his hunting business. Kyle was not yet certain about the size of one mammoth hog, but he knew he needed to kill much more than just a few. Having a few more capable trackers like Jaden would help a lot, enslaved or not.</p><p>Soon, the village came into view, turning out to be a simple hamlet. The two Ghosts that followed Kyle faltered a little, recalling their own villages near Ocra from which they had been ousted from themselves. The peaceful sight of the drifting smoke from fired clay chimneys merged with wooden roofing and walls gave them a sense of longing and memory that reinvigorated what they were fighting for.</p><p>The squad walked into the small little hamlet, a simple layout of about ten houses surrounding a river that ran through with a strong current. A few kids could be seen playing with some shiny marbles, tossing them into a ring and cheering over the results, while their mothers washed and hand squeezed the clothes dry with their strong arms, scrubbing them hard on jagged wooden boards to drain the moisture out.</p><p>A few village militia soldiers were already armed and standing on guard; their suspicion was raised the moment Kyle's squad appeared at the outskirts of the hamlet, drawing their swords and shields as well as aiming with longbows at them. Only one of them had a gun, except it was a mere arctech musket, which was highly inefficient and had a slow reload.</p><p>Still, they stepped forward bravely, the leader wielding the musket shouting at the approaching squad. &quot;Stop right there! If you're from Harri- Jaden? Is that you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Chief, it's me; I'm back.&quot; Jaden walked up carefully to the leader, his hands raised in surrender to show his stance. Conversely, Kyle and the other Ghosts didn't let go of their guns, though they did not aim back at the squad.</p><p>&quot;Jaden, it's really you! Where the hell have you been? Do you know how worried I was?&quot; The village chief lowered the musket, letting out a sigh of relief, the wrinkles and blemishes of old age on his face softening a little. &quot;Almost everyone else thought you were dead!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, chief, I... I ran off to the city.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Desham? Didn't I tell you it was dangerous now? There's a war about to happen; you can't just walk off like this. Who are the men behind you? I don't recognize any of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They... they are some friends I made in Desham! They are looking to hunt some mammoth hogs to bring meat back to the city.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Out of the question. The mammoth hogs will run rampant if you kill them off - they are not dumb. They will find this hamlet and destroy us in a stampede!&quot; The village chief shot back.</p><p>[This doesn't seem to be going well. Should we capture all of them?] Sasha offered her suggestion while Kyle used his enhanced eyesight to look carefully at the marbles that the children were playing with. <em>Those marbles... they are arcia crystals!</em></p><p>[Not yet. There's something more valuable to the village. It may be worth going the diplomatic route.] Kyle replied to Sasha, while he slung his railgun to the back, stepping up next to Jaden and approaching the village chief, extending a handshake. &quot;Good to meet you. I'm Kyle, leader of the hunting squad.&quot;</p><p>The village chief stared at the stretched-out hand, only returning the handshake with visible reluctance. &quot;How did you meet Jaden?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Jaden himself offered his services to us and brought us here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You!&quot; The village chief turned sharply towards Jaden with a furious glare. &quot;I told you not to tell anyone about the village until the war is over! Now that the word is out, they'll come for us!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's the point of hiding it?!&quot; Jaden shouted back. &quot;We should be standing up and fighting back against those greedy idiots exploiting all of us Versians, not hiding in some backwater village.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hiding in this 'backwater' village is exactly what's going to keep us alive. Do you really want to die in a meaningless war where lives are traded just for the schemes of men who hardly give a shit about you?&quot; The village chief retorted. &quot;Now your rash actions have exposed our existence, and we'll be dragged into this war! We should move now immediately and find someplace deeper in the Keru Forest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is exactly why I left the village! There are things bigger than just sticking your head in the sand and living life obliviously!&quot; Jaden stormed off, clearly infuriated while he walked past Feldon who was taking a break against a nearby tree, breathing in the fresh forest air.</p><p>&quot;Jaden! You come back here right now!&quot; The village chief shouted towards Jaden's back, though Jaden did not turn around. Letting out yet another exasperated sigh, he turned to face Kyle with a sheepish smile. &quot;Sorry about that one. It seems that the real reason why he brought you here was to try and convince us to get off our asses. Ever since his parents died to Nest...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Died to Nest?&quot; Kyle questioned further.</p><p>&quot;Perhaps we can continue this discussion further in my house.&quot; The village chief led the squad to the house, while Sasha remained on overwatch around the city. She enjoyed the cool breeze that rushed through the canopy of the forest as she sat on a branch, chewing on a ration pack herself.</p><p>The village chief’s hut was a standard two-story house fashioned from wooden beams, carved from the same trees that surrounded them in the Keru Forest. The thick sturdy beams provided ample protection from the environment, the smell of the forest permeating the atmosphere as the village chief opened the door for them, letting Kyle and the other Ghosts enter the house.</p><p>&quot;We had a lot of run-ins with the Nest guards ever since they moved in. Three whole other villages have been wiped out so far; their residents have been forced to be refugees. Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. Name's Draken.&quot; The village chief motioned to a few wooden seats scattered around the homely room. Pots and pans, along with multiple vials filled with different herbs and potion combinations, dotted the walls on various shelves. A slow cooking pot brewed a fragrant tea, the aroma soothing as it wafted upwards to the high ceiling, the roof supported by wooden beams.</p><p>&quot;Good to meet you, Chief Drake,&quot; Kyle replied with a calm tone, surprising the two Ghosts and even Feldon, who almost spluttered on his water flask. They had long been accustomed to Kyle being extremely domineering and aggressive in all of his negotiations, so to see him act so humble and docile here felt extremely off.</p><p>&quot;So, heard you want to hunt the hogs. Unfortunately, that's a bad idea. The roaming herds are dangerous, and I don't think just the four of you are enough to go up against them. On top of that, the population of mammoth hogs have been increasing dramatically as well.&quot; Drake poured two cups of the aromatic tea, handing it over to Kyle who gladly accepted it, though he did not drink it.</p><p>&quot;I understand that your main concern is the protection of the village.&quot; Kyle diverted the topic. &quot;It isn't that you are worried about the mammoth hogs taking revenge - you're worried about Nest figuring out where this village is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're surprisingly astute... yes. You are right - we want to be able to defend ourselves, and the only feasible way is to hide. There's no way we can fight against Nest or even Harrison's guards.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, the way I see it: you need protection, I need resources. We can work out a deal.&quot; Kyle pressed his position. &quot;Help us get the mammoth hogs, and we'll make sure your village isn't exposed. If it is exposed, we'll fight for you.&quot;</p><p>Drake sipped on his teacup slowly, his eyes squinting. &quot;I don't think what I'm saying is getting through - the four of you won't be enough to deal with the mammoth hog herd, not even one stray one. I've seen Harrison Industries try to cull the herds near their new forestry areas: it's safe to say it was an absolute failure. Good riddance though, but I wouldn't wish the same fate on you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm... then it seems that we are at an impasse.&quot; Kyle placed down his cup of tea, having not drunk it at all. &quot;Perhaps I will return at a later date to offer more attractive terms. Thank you for your hospitality.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you for understanding.&quot; Drake stood up, offering his hand which Kyle gladly shook. &quot;I can tell you're still keen on hunting the hogs. Jaden is a good tracker, but I implore you to hunt at a further area downstream from the river so the village is not implicated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand.&quot; Kyle nodded, leaving the village chief's house and walking along the river. As he walked past the children playing with the shiny marbles, one of the marbles rolled up to his feet, prompting Kyle to pick it up.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Refined Arcia Crystal (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Only an artificer of renown can achieve such a feat.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Enhanced Arcia Energy Capacity and Output.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>This is definitely worth an investigation...</em> Kyle tossed the marble back towards the kids, clearly feeling the village's chief eyes staring into his back. In fact, many of the villagers were peeking out of their houses, observing each and every movement of the Ghost squad as they headed back towards where they came from.</p><p>[Sir, I saw someone strange. Last house along the river, red brick walls.] Sasha's words had Kyle look towards the window of the brick house, noticing a foreign lady looking back right at home. As their eyes met, the lady hurriedly ducked, drawing the curtains across and blocking off Kyle's view of the interior. However, that momentary glance had shown that there were countless arcia etchers and weapons hanging on the inside of the house, along with a furnace for smelting.</p><p>As they returned to the fuming Jaden, Kyle tapped Jaden's shoulder. &quot;It's a bit strange for this small village hamlet to have an arctech workshop or blacksmith of that size. There's only fifty of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Arctech workshop? We don't have anything like that.&quot; Jaden scratched his chin in confusion, before looking over to the brick house that stood out in clear contrast to the other wooden ones. &quot;Huh, don't recall anyone's house looking like that. It's only been four months since I left though. Maybe Drake hired an arctech engineer? Either way, I'm done with this stupid ass village. We'll just go hunt in a different area.... were there only four of you? I feel like someone is missing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There's only four of us.&quot; Kyle asserted. &quot;Now lead the way.&quot;</p><p>The Ghost squad soon left the village behind them, Feldon feeling everything was a little strange as he walked next to Kyle, whispering into his ear once more. &quot;Boss, I've never seen you just give up and walk away like this! That village would have been useful as a base of operations, and its people were good for navigating the forest. The village chief was even a herbalist - he could help us make potions!&quot;</p><p>A sly smile grew on Kyle's face. &quot;Who said I was giving up?&quot;</p><p>@@@@@@</p><p>In the middle of the night, silence reigned supreme in the hamlet, save for the chirps of insects and the calming current of the river. Drake rested on his bed, thinking about the hunting squad that had turned up today as well as Jaden's eventual departure once more. He clenched his fist, conflicted on whether to help Jaden or not, though he finally decided that the village was more important than the orphan. <em>Looks like your son acts the same way as you do after all, brother...</em> He turned onto his side, the bedside table featuring a picture of him with his brother posing next to a fallen mammoth hog, along with a younger Jaden smiling from ear to ear. As his eyelids began to close, a sudden knock on his door jolted him awake.</p><p>He sluggishly moved to the door, opening it to reveal a red haired middle-aged lady, her demeanor serious as she shoved past him with surprising vigor, motioning for him to close the door.</p><p>&quot;Hayden, what the hell are you doing here? If anyone finds out you came here in the dead of the night-&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's the least of our worries now. I'm afraid I may have been exposed. Those hunters that came earlier in the day, they may have been mercenaries hired by Nest to track me down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nest...? But I didn't see any emblem or tattoo-&quot;</p><p>&quot;A tracker sent by Nest wouldn't wear their colors that blatantly.&quot; Hayden rolled her eyes, the wrinkles on her face creasing as she sat down on a chair, her legs jittery with anxiety. &quot;I'm sure they were here to hunt me down. When I looked at them, one of them was clearly looking right at me with intent. They know me – they recognize my face.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's not possible, it's been months since you arrived and we've been doing fine. You haven't left the village at all!&quot; Drake sat down opposite her, resting his elbow on the table with a concerned expression. &quot;Jaden isn't dumb, he'll know if they have bad motives overall.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I never met Jaden before, but from what I've seen today, it's clear that he is just a kid. Still, I think it's best if I leave the village permanently. It's too dangerous for me to stay behind and endanger the rest of you. I came here today to give you my thanks for sheltering me and welcoming me into the community.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can't be serious.&quot; Drake gulped instinctively, scanning Hayden's face before he finally realized she was being serious. He tried to speak, but he couldn't find the words to express what he felt, until Hayden grabbed his hand, clasping it tightly.</p><p>&quot;Come with me. We'll leave tonight. Pack everything into a sack and make our way deeper into the forest. Walk out of Versia by the end of the week.&quot; Hayden looked Drake in the eyes expectantly. &quot;We'll do fine - you got the traps, I got the machinery. We can handle anything that comes out way together.&quot;</p><p>Drake wanted to say yes, but the thought of the village weighed him down. &quot;I... I can't. The village is counting on me. At least until I'm confident that the village can do well without me. Look, I'll help you pack up and send you off. Take a few potions before you go, especially some antidotes.&quot; He got up from his seat, missing the momentary sign of exasperation on Hayden's face.</p><p>&quot;That's alright. I'll pack up myself. Goodbye, Drake. Thanks for everything.&quot; Hayden's voice became colder than ever, leaving Drake's house before he could collect all of the potions and antidotes to pass to her.</p><p>&quot;Hayden. Hayden!&quot; Drake called out beyond the door, but Hayden didn't turn around, focused on returning to her brick house. Some of the villagers who were still awake peeped out behind their window sills, always curious about the latest gossip, as they watched Drake stare at Hayden with a forlorn expression. Hayden's figure walking away reminded Drake of Jaden's departure today as well. <em>Why does it feel like everyone is leaving when I'm doing my best to protect us?</em></p><p>Letting out the third exasperated sigh for the day, Drake closed the door, placing the potions and antidotes back into a cabinet before retiring for the night, lying back on his bed. However, he could hardly sleep, only thinking about Hayden and her imminent departure. <em>It's for the best, its for the village, for the village...</em> Two hours passed as he tossed and turned in bed, unable to rest properly with his mind in turmoil. <em>I should go and clear things up with Hayden before she leaves.</em></p><p>As he got up from the bed, a sudden distinctive shot of an arctech rifle was fired into the air, earning shouts and screams coming from the villagers' houses. Bright arctech spotlights blasted across the village, shining through the windows and disorientating Drake while the village militia scrambled to get out. [Illegal squatters of the Keru Forest. Your offenses are twofold.] A loud arctech radio speaker blared out with a jarring static, two Nest guards carrying it along with the arctech spotlights while another dozen wielded rifles as well, taking up a position just outside the village.</p><p>[One. Illegal occupation of an area that does not belong to you. The land is under the ownership of Tenar Logging Incorporated, a subsidiary of Harrison Industries . You will now be forcibly removed from the area. New housing will be provided at your new destination in Desham.]</p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about? I’ve been here for over seven years – this is the first time I’ve heard of such bullshit!” One of the villagers yelled as he stepped out of his house, armed with a sword and wooden shield. “The Keru Forest doesn’t belong to anyone, and certainly not you cunts!”</p><p>[Two. You have been harboring dangerous revolutionaries who plot the demise of the Versian Government, seeking to upend the stability of the people. Surrender them, and you will be granted leniency during your trial.]</p><p>Drake's heart plummeted when he heard that. <em>Hayden!</em> He quickly put on his battle gear and armor, snatching his musket that was rested against the wall and rushing out of the house, the rest of the village militia having already gathered in place. However, there seemed to be no hope of fending off the imminent Nest attack, and the number of Nest soldiers was on par with that of the militia. The disparity in the equipment and weaponry only made the battle seem even more hopeless.</p><p>Still, Drake stood strong, stepping out in front of the militia and assuming his role as village chief. &quot;I am the chief of this village, Drake! I request a meeting with your leader!&quot; He shouted out while he shielded his eyes from the blinding spotlights, hoping to stall long enough to figure a way out either through diplomacy or compromise. He stood firm, unafraid of the rifles aimed right at him that could take off his head in an instant.</p><p>From beyond the bright spotlights, the leader of the Nest squad stepped forward. &quot;We have received reports that you are harboring dangerous individuals who are active revolutionaries against the government!&quot; The squad leader asserted confidently.</p><p>&quot;I don't see why this backwater village of ours would have anything to do with trying to overthrow the government.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't play games with me. She was seen lurking around the restricted zone under Tenar Logging, we have eyewitness reports from our own guards. Her tracks lead right here!&quot;</p><p><em>What? Hayden hasn't left the village in forever!</em> &quot;That's not possible, none of us have gone more than five kilometers beyond this village! You must have been mistaken.&quot;</p><p>The Nest squad leader squinted his eyes in suspicion. &quot;The penalty for harboring an enemy of Versia is death by public execution under the new Sedition Act put forth by President Mornero. You are to show me where they are immediately, or you will be considered as an accomplice and dealt with accordingly!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about, the person you are looking for is not here!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine. Men, search all the houses and arrest all the villagers!&quot;</p><p>Before Drake could protest, his defiance earned him a sudden blow to the head, the Nest squad leader striking him from the front with the butt of an arctech rifle. He toppled to the floor, dropping his musket which clattered along the gravel path. The villagers gasped while mothers hid their children in their houses. The militia tried to step forward, but they, too, were rooted in fear, unwilling to fight against the overwhelming firepower that the Nest guards had.</p><p>&quot;This is your last chance!&quot; The squad leader announced once more as the Nest soldiers began to filter out, segregating the villagers and cuffing them. &quot;Anyone who gives me information about where the revolutionary is will be rewarded greatly, and will not be charged with treason!&quot;</p><p>Drake was hauled up by two soldiers and restrained with handcuffs as well, dragged along the familiar decade-old path along the river towards his own house, led by the squad leader. His head lolled about, dizzy from the frontal hit. However, as they passed the brick house, he could see Hayden crouching behind a wall, hidden from sight and wielding a strange-looking triple-cylinder machine, preparing to fight back. Drake's eyes widened, and he mouthed 'NO' and shook his head violently. Fighting against Nest like this would result in too many casualties, especially when only Hayden had something useful. The rest of the militia were only armed with bows, spears, and swords, which were inefficient against the arctech rifles.</p><p>The squad leader kicked down Drake's door violently, smashing apart the hinge with his metal sole boot. Drake's body was unceremoniously thrown into the house, while the two soldiers began to check and flip over every cabinet and shelf, countless precious herbs smashing onto the floor on purpose. &quot;Search the whole damn house, I want to know where that revolutionary is!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure you want to know?&quot; A familiar voice echoed from the wooden beams high above in the elevated ceiling, a shadow dropping from above and slashing his machete deep into the squad leader's head, the blade stopping short when it reached the neck. The squad leader's head split apart, the two halves dangling as blood gushed out from the shredded throat and revealing the sickening gray pulsating matter that was his brain.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Nest Squad Leader, +20 EXP</p><p></p><p>The two squad leaders barely turned around when the same shadow lunged at them, a glowing arm illuminating the dimly lit room as the machete in its hand sliced through their necks like butter. They clutched the gaping wound on their necks, trying to stem the bleeding while they collapsed to the ground in a quivering heap, the blood staining the wooden floor panels of Drake's house.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Nest Soldier, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p>Drake stared in horror at the ghastly sight of the mutilated bodies, wincing as the machete was also swung towards him. However, instead of cutting off his head, the blade snapped the cuffs apart, allowing Drake to move his arms freely again and finally see who it was. &quot;You! The hunter!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It seems you are in need of protection. Are the terms now attractive enough for you?&quot; Kyle grinned, flicking the blood of his machete, using the clothes of the fallen Nest soldiers to clean the blade.</p><p>Drake wasn't dumb, immediately realizing what was going on. &quot;You led them right to us! Hayden would have never been dumb enough to go anywhere near the restricted zone. You brought them here!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's a stretch, I'm just a hunter. Also, does it really matter now? Your villagers are about to be arrested and transported off to a refugee camp. And you are completely helpless to stop it, including that old revolutionary you have been harboring all this time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Damn you, this is blackmail!&quot; Drake cursed with all his might, though he did not try to attack Kyle or act aggressive in any way, especially not around the fallen bodies that Kyle had just easily killed.</p><p>&quot;Time is ticking.&quot; Kyle tapped his blade, a soft ringing sound emitting from the resonance. &quot;Lives are at stake. You said you wanted to protect your people, but here you are worrying about morals. Are you going to give up the freedom of your villagers for your own conscience? Once they find out about these three bodies...&quot;</p><p>Drake could still hear the shouts and screams from outside as Nest soldiers continued to terrorize the villagers, oblivious to the death of their squad leader. He knew that if they found out, all of them might be killed on the spot. His heart burnt with hatred against Kyle, but he eventually succumbed, bowing to Kyle fully. &quot;Please, save my villagers, and in exchange, I will help you hunt the mammoth hogs down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not good enough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The deal has changed. Those Nest soldiers are a bit difficult to kill off. You're going to have to offer more than that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Didn't you just want the meat?&quot; Drake shot back.</p><p>&quot;I can easily get the meat myself. Jaden could help me track it easily in a few days. Why do I need you?&quot; Kyle smiled.</p><p>Drake heard another sharp shriek as a gunshot went off, children crying in the distance. His guilt and desire to protect the village finally tipped him over, the pressure unbearable as he bowed again to Kyle. &quot;Okay, okay I'll do anything you ask, just save the village, please!&quot;</p><p>Kyle tapped his arctech radio. &quot;Feldon, you hear that? Get the other Ghosts moving. Full sweep.&quot;</p><p>[Loud and clear, boss.] Feldon's excited voice came over the radio. [Time to clean up the trash.]</p><p><strong>Chapter 121 - Commercialized Agriculture</strong></p><p>&quot;Get down on the ground!&quot; A Nest soldier roared, shoving the barrel of his arctech rifle against a defiant village militiaman, beating him down just outside his own house. Another soldier grabbed a frightened mother and her son, shoving them out of the house before entering, smashing, and checking for the supposed revolutionary. All across the small hamlet, small little scuffles were breaking out as villagers tried to resist the Nest soldiers breaking into their homes, but none of them were willing to fight back, afraid of the consequences or endangering their loved ones. How were they to fight back against enemies far more equipped than they were?</p><p>&quot;Don't fight back, just stay down!&quot; A mother had to hold back her own son, preventing him from lashing out in anger as he watched the Nest soldier raid and pillage his house mercilessly, snatching and grabbing anything of value. Before he laid his grubby hands on a sapphire ring, something snapped within the son, prompting him to grab a nearby fireplace iron stick and use it to impale the Nest soldier from behind.</p><p>However, his inexperience had the sharp tip miss entirely, going past the Nest soldier who had moved in coincidence. No words needed to be said as the Nest soldier immediately grabbed the attacking son's head with one hand, dashing his forehead against the wall violently in a fierce slam. A splat of blood stained the once homely walls, the stains skidding downwards as the son's body fell to the floor, suffering a concussion.</p><p>&quot;NO!&quot; The mother wailed, running up to put herself between the Nest soldier and her unconscious son's body. Instead, her bravery only earned a pellet that ripped through her simple skirt and the flesh in her thighs, the searing pellets lodging themselves near her femur, causing her to trip onto the floor, her face wracked with tremendous pain.</p><p>&quot;Looks like you'll be better off as a sack of meat than handing you over to the authorities!&quot; The Nest soldier grinned as he grabbed the mother's head by her hair, dragging her around the floor and flipping her over, aiming the rifle right at her head. &quot;I should've killed your son by now, but maybe you can do something for me if you want to keep him alive!&quot;</p><p>Before he could act on his nefarious intentions, a sudden knife blade found its way into his throat, gutting his neck out while the owner of the knife blade gave a sidelong kick to the ribs of the Nest soldier, the force gouging out the blade and slicing through the tendons that kept his head upright. The mother shrieked as she watched the dying Nest soldier crumpled into a useless heap, scrambling away from his killer, who stood behind the body and mercilessly kicked it.</p><p>Ignoring the panicking mother, the killer walked up to the unconscious son, popping a tube-like vial open and pouring the healing potion within onto his head. Within a few seconds, the son was already stirring awake, his head still groggy from impact.</p><p>The killer left without a word as gunshots and brutish howls of fighting echoed off the gigantic red bark trees that surrounded the hamlets, some pellets zipping through the foilage up through the canopy, causing a flock of birds to scatter, their rainbow feathers fluttering in the sky. Before any of the Nest soldiers were even aware, the Ghosts had launched a coordinated attack, catching them off-guard and spreading panic.</p><p>&quot;Where's the squad leader? Regroup! Regroup!&quot; An anxious Nest soldier tried to call out to his comrades, waving his hands frantically only to paint a target on his back, three pellets driving through his weak, soft metal chest plate. The pellets drilled holes through his ribcage with blood gushing out, his body collapsing in front of a few shocked villagers that had been rounded up cowering outside.</p><p>The battle was fast and brutal, Sasha and Feldon making quick work of the clearly inexperienced Nest guards, some of whom seemed to have just been hired from the refugee camps of Desham as well. Despite their numerical superiority, they had nothing to answer against the professional slaughter that the Ghosts wrecked upon them.</p><p>Yet even as the last Nest soldier died, the damage to the village had already been done. The homes had been ransacked, and the dignity of the villagers was in tatters, children and mothers alike having been beaten up. While the deaths around them were horrifying to the largely pacifist villagers, not a single one amongst them thought the deaths were undeserved.</p><p>The Ghosts cut and dismantled any cuffs or restraints the Nest soldiers had put on the villagers, setting them free. Some of the villagers recoiled in fear, afraid that this was another armed group who had come to oust them. Disputes over territory were common in the Keru Forest, especially with the lack of law enforcement. Thankfully, the villagers recognized a familiar face among the Ghosts. &quot;Jaden! It's Jaden!&quot; One of the kids excitedly shouted.</p><p>&quot;Don't worry, guys, they are with me. We're going to protect you!&quot; Jaden gave a thumbs-up, preparing to bandage up an injured villager who had broken his ankle. Drake was already sprinting out of the house, shouting to the villagers and gathering them together in a central opening amidst their trashed houses. &quot;Are you all safe? Anyone in need of healing? I-I have healing potions! Get the injured to my house, quickly!&quot;</p><p>While Drake and Jaden began to lead those suffering from bruises toward his house, Hayden let out a sigh of relief, still hiding behind her house with her triple-cylinder gun at the ready. She slung the gun to her side, hefting up a large rucksack filled to the brim with countless machinery and relics, about to leave the village without a word before someone unfamiliar appeared in front of her in the darkness of the night, his figure only slightly perceivable from the reflected glow of the hamlet's fire and Nest spotlights still left on.</p><p>Hayden dropped the rucksack instantly, about to bring her gun to bear, when the figure in front of her moved quickly, his body becoming a blur. She tried to track his movement with her eyes, but her body could not react in time, a machete with stains of blood now pressing against her throat. &quot;Let's not get too hasty, Hayden Nu. There's no reason for you to leave the village now that it's sa-&quot;</p><p>As her assailant spoke, Hayden wasn't out of options just yet; a sudden glaring blast of light erupted the necklace around her neck, blinding her assailant and allowing Hayden to move. But before she could draw a knife along her thigh holster, an iron grip clasped around her head, the force unimaginable as Hayden let out a cry of pain, unable to withstand the pressure.</p><p>Two kicks to the back of her knees had her fall to the ground, forced to kneel while the assailant still held a machete to her neck. &quot;For one of the original revolutionaries, you're not as spry as I thought you would be. I'm not here to hurt you. If I can help it.&quot;</p><p>Hayden gasped sharply as the iron grip on her head was released; the machete retracted to allow her to catch her breath. As she regained her composure, she had a small smirk on her face. &quot;You better not hurt me. I'm sure Harrison wouldn't appreciate it if you brought me back in tatters.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why would I give you over to Harrison?&quot; The assailant sheathed the machete behind his back on his belt, walking over in front of Hayden, where his face was illuminated by the light.</p><p>&quot;You're the hunter this morning. Aren't you hired to track me down and haul me back?&quot; Hayden scoffed as she stood back up, dusting off her knees. &quot;Just get it over with.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You look very different from the pictures I've seen of you. Much younger and more energetic.&quot; Kyle carefully paced around her. &quot;It's a shame I did not manage to rescue it from the hideout.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The hideout...?&quot; Hayden's confusion only worsened until she finally realized what Kyle was referring to. &quot;There's no way, the hideout is only known to-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dekar and your missing President Johan, yes. Only they know the real layout of the catacombs. Unfortunately, I do not currently have Dekar with me. Let me assure you that I am not on Harrison's side. We are the Ghosts of Versia.&quot; Kyle introduced dramatically.</p><p>Hayden, however, shook her head vigorously. &quot;Impossible. I heard through the radio that all the Ghosts perished in the catacombs after they attacked the Grand Exhibition and tried to assassinate Harrison. Pretending to be them is in bad taste - their sacrifice should not be tarnished by the likes of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated, no doubt for the purpose of propaganda.&quot; Kyle waved his hand dismissively. &quot;Whether or not you believe us, I still require your assistance.&quot;</p><p>Hayden squinted her eyes. &quot;I'm just an old lady at this stage. I can't help you with anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't belittle yourself. I know who you are. Hayden Nu, Harrison's former top researcher for arctech applications. Inventor of the Aurtla, the first native heavier-than-air flight completely independent of relics from ancient ruins.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not the inventor of that blasted warmachine - I never agreed for it to be used for the military!&quot; Hayden snapped back aggressively. &quot;Harrison has twisted all of my designs for his own uses instead of the benefit of Versia, and that's exactly why we're in such a shit state right now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what are you doing about it? Last I checked, you've been hiding out in this village for months on end.&quot; Kyle motioned towards the hamlet. &quot;You don't seem very concerned that Versia is in a terrible state now. You were even planning to go deeper into the Forest, weren't you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not about to justify myself to some lowlife who thinks he can masquerade as a Ghost.&quot; Hayden spat with derision, her determination strong. &quot;Either let me go right now or just kill me alread-&quot;</p><p>Her heart stopped for a moment as her body barely had any time to react, Kyle drawing the machete faster than she could blink. Her expression froze as the tip of the machete stopped just one centimeter from her eyes in an instant, the adrenaline immediately rushing through her veins while she stumbled back in fear.</p><p>&quot;So much for determination to die,&quot; Kyle remarked, twirling the machete in his hand expertly. &quot;I can kill you at any time I want, no need for you to ask. Your life right now is in my hands.&quot;</p><p>Hayden gulped instinctively, her heart palpitating rapidly from the near-death scenario she had just saw. If she had just moved forward a little, she could have lost an entire eye now. Still, the display of skill from Kyle showed to her that he was definitely not an ordinary fighter. <em>Could he really be a Ghost?</em> &quot;What do you want from me? The plans for Aurtla? I don't have them anymore on me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't want the plans, they are of little use to me. Pitiful things that can be easily shot down.&quot; Kyle said dismissively, shocking Hayden.</p><p>&quot;Easily shot down? Those 'pitiful things' fly at speeds unheard of - not even an arctech wagon can go that fast!&quot; Hayden retorted in a fit of rage, defending her invention unknowingly.</p><p>Kyle didn't respond, merely glancing around across the canopy of trees before seeing the outline of a bird the size of a barrel perched on a tree branch between the leaves, its wings folded as it slept quietly. &quot;See that bird up there, the third branch from the left?&quot;</p><p>Hayden squinted her eyes, barely able to make it out. She wouldn't have been able to spot the bird without Kyle having pointed it out, and her eyesight was not as good as that of Kyle's 229-A-X package. &quot;Yeah, what abou-&quot;</p><p>A sudden bang from a railgun erupted across the hamlet, a projectile streaking across at a blinding speed that slammed into the bird, before erupting in a ball of flames that set the leaves of the tree smoldering, sparks flying everywhere. The villagers were shocked at the sudden attack, and some of the villagers spread out to see what was happening. Bits and pieces of the bird's flesh flew everywhere, scattering across the forest ground with a sickening splat, all while Hayden watched on in horror, her head swiveling only to see Kyle still pointing, having not fired a single pellet himself.</p><p>&quot;Convinced?&quot; Kyle smirked.</p><p>&quot;Wha-what... but....&quot; Hayden couldn't wrap her head around it, struggling to figure out what was going on. <em>The speed of the projectile is not something a normal Versian rifle can handle. Anything like that would have blown apart the barrel immediately or sent a reverse wave into the arcia energy of the user and damaged his veins...</em></p><p>&quot;Want to know how? Join me as a Ghost. I will help you fight against Harrison and find your old comrades again. Dekar is in Creuliz right now, also gathering allies to help.&quot; Kyle explained. &quot;Your skills as an arctech engineer are needed in the fight. The time for hiding is over - now is the time to step out and stand for what you believe in. If you want in, follow me back to Drake's house. Otherwise, I wish you all the best.&quot;</p><p>He turned around, walking back towards the center of the hamlet, leaving Hayden in the dark and alone. No one else seemed to be around, though instead of running away deeper into the forest, she made up her mind, grabbing her rucksack and following Kyle from behind, albeit at a further distance.</p><p>[Sir, you were right. She's coming back to the village. How did you convince her not to run?] Sasha's voice came into Kyle's mind as he walked among the injured villagers who were now being treated by Drake and a few other helpers. They were still wary about the sudden explosion nearby, but seeing that there were no follow-up attacks of any sort, the tension died down a little, though everyone was still a little on edge, their eyes alert.</p><p>[I just demonstrated I can blow up a bird in the middle of the night through the forest from seemingly nowhere. Anyone who decides to run after seeing that is an idiot not worth recruiting.]</p><p>Drake spotted Kyle coming by, though he still continued on his job, bringing potions and placing herbs on bruises to soothe the aching pain for some of the villagers. To his surprise, Kyle handed him a few vials of health potions, allowing the healing process for the villagers to go a lot faster. Drake was about to open his mouth to say thanks, but he caught a glimpse of the pensive Hayden approaching them, still hoisting the rucksack on her back along with the triple-cylinder gun slung in front.</p><p>He quickly moved over to her, trying to grab her hand. &quot;Hayden, thank the Goddess you're okay. I...&quot;</p><p>Hayden allowed Drake to touch her hand, but she averted her gaze, unwilling to look Drake in the eye. &quot;Sorry Drake, not now, just.... lets talk about it later. We got bigger things to worry about.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right, right, of course.&quot; Drake nodded, letting Hayden walk past him. The memory of him rejecting Hayden's offer to elope was still fresh in his mind, tearing apart from within mentally until a weird whistle beside him from one of the Ghosts interrupted his train of thought.</p><p>&quot;Looks like something spicy going on between the two of you.&quot; Feldon remarked, a sly grin on his face as he nudged Drake in the arm twice. &quot;Come on, tell me whats happening?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Err... Do I know you?&quot; Drake cocked an eyebrow, unable to recall if he had talked to Feldon before.</p><p>&quot;Name's Feldon. I'm sorta in charge of the Ghosts. Well, except for Kyle. And Sasha. But that's beside the point.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look, I really don't have time for this. People are hurt and -&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, I know, but our boss got it covered. Look.&quot; Feldon motioned towards Kyle, who was healing the injured with his Necklace of Healing whenever it was off-cooldown, trying to build a rapport with the villagers. It was definitely working, many now recognizing the Ghosts as their saviors.</p><p>Drake's shoulder relaxed a little, knowing that the villagers were going to be alright. &quot;Well, I guess it's just that, I'm stuck between choosing her or choosing the village. Sometimes, I wonder why I can't have both. Instead, now she's most likely going to leave me forever. We might never get back to how we were before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, hey, it's alright.&quot; Feldon drooped his armored arm around Drake, as though they had already become best buddies. &quot;You know, I had to suffer a divorce back then just like that, too. We quarreled day in and day out, always about money and whether or not to have children. It's hard to find someone aligned with all of your views in this day and age. People come and go all the time, and when she left me, it was painful and difficult. It really showed me that life is fleeting and that this whole time I spent wondering about what to do could have been used to do something better. Anyway, what I am trying to say is that don't worry too much. My first wife pulled the same trick on me, too, packing up and leaving without telling me.&quot;</p><p>Drake was a bit lost from that rambling. &quot;And... your first wife came back in the end?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Of course not. Heard she's having a blast in Proco. Married one of the mayors or something, fuck if I know. Got a second wife with kids now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What even is the moral of the story here?&quot; Drake groaned as he facepalmed.</p><p>&quot;Uhh... all things work out in the end? Just not with the one you were hoping for. But yeah, now that you mention it, we were talking about you and that lady-hey, where are you going? I wasn't done yet! You'll be remiss not to listen to Feldon, the love expert!&quot; Feldon called out after Drake, who had given up on the ranting Feldon.</p><p>Many of the able-bodied villagers clamored around Drake as he walked past them, all wanting to offer up their opinions on what to do next.</p><p>&quot;How did they know we had a revolutionary here in the village? Who told them?&quot; A villager asked around loudly, his voice carrying over the injured.</p><p>&quot;Didn't you hear? They said she was skulking about Tenar Logging. She's too dangerous for us - we should kick Hayden out of the village right this instant!&quot; An elderly lady tapped her cane forcibly, ranting.</p><p>&quot;That doesn't make any sense!&quot; The first villager shot back. &quot;They already want to evict us on a false charge of illegal squatter, when we have been here for decades! Why would kicking Hayden out help us in any way?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't care what happens, but I just don't want my son to be caught in the crossfire!&quot; Another mother chimed in. &quot;We should surrender to the military immediately - tell them who killed their soldiers and who the revolutionaries are, then maybe we can avoid retribution.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This village was built on trust and loyalty among us, having worked together for generations. If we are selling out our own people, what kind of village is this?!&quot; Jaden interjected, furious.</p><p>&quot;Hayden is not one of us, she barely joined us a few months ago!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And? You still use her skills and tools to feed your children - don't forget the metal post you use to cook!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We should move away from here - find another area. Grab everything we need and just get the fuck away from here. The Keru Forest is big enough for us to hide somewhere else!&quot; Another anxious villager chimed in.</p><p>&quot;We won't be able to survive - deeper in is way too dangerous, nearly all the creatures there can kill us instantly if we're not well prepared. There's a reason why we're even living in this part of the Keru Forest, because it's safer!&quot; Jaden waved his arms animatedly. &quot;Anyone who's been out hunting knows why there's no villages deeper in!&quot;</p><p>The argument was heated, as the villagers were clearly divided on what to do. Not many were willing to participate in the argument, some simply heading home to check on their damaged furniture from the rough handling of the soldiers, while a few curious kids warily picked up a dropped repeater, examining it before their mother quickly snatched it away.</p><p>Hayden sat on the side of the argument, watching the debate go nowhere. She rested her chin on her hand, her elbow pressed against her crossed legs, and she waited with an exasperated expression. Drake, too, was at a loss for words. He tried to enter the conversation, but the rising tensions between conflicting ideas were stressing him out greatly. This was the first attack on the village in living memory, and watching the villagers be divided like this was hard to stomach. A hand rested on his shoulder; Drake turned around to see Kyle. &quot;Let me handle this,&quot; Kyle said as he stepped forward into the middle of the villagers.</p><p>As he moved past the throng, none of them dared to block his path, all of them having seen his proficiency in combat. His towering height had him taller than most of the woodcutters and hunters in the village, his features also innately attractive to them. Furthermore, he had saved them from the brutality of Nest, and even offered healing and healing potions to the injured.</p><p>&quot;I am Kyle. Leader of the Ghosts of Versia.&quot; Kyle announced, earning a few gasps from villagers who had heard the recent news. The rumor of the attack on the Grand Exhibition had already spread fast, and even an isolated village like this had also heard something about it. &quot;We are fighting against the tyranny of Nest, Harrison Industries, and the corrupt government who supports them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't care about your upstart political movement - this is our village we're talking about!&quot; The same elderly lady rammed her walking cane into the floor angrily. &quot;We don't want any part of the conflict, none of the war! We just want to be left in peace!&quot; Her statements earned a few approving murmurs even among those who had been arguing with her; most of the villagers were averse to the idea of war.</p><p>&quot;But the conflict is here, whether you like it or not. Running away is not going to change the fact that Nest is now eyeing your homeland and your rightful grounds as their property. Even if we and Hayden leave right now - they will still come back for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We can just leave! Go deeper into the forest and stake a new claim!&quot; A villager called out.</p><p>&quot;Then can you survive the creatures and monsters who will no doubt try to kill you?&quot; Kyle countered.</p><p>&quot;We won't know until we try. If all fifty of us work together, we can make it happen! If the mammoth hogs try to attack us, we can fight back together!&quot; The villager clenched his fist, though not many agreed with him, some scoffing at his foolhardy suggestion.</p><p>&quot;Don't you see? Wherever you go, either deeper into the forest, or out into the open plains, the peace that you are searching for is not by averting your eyes and shying away from conflict. The peace that you seek is by claiming your birth rights as humans, as Versians, to stand up for yourself in the face of tyranny!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Conflict is a cycle of hate, a cycle of destruction! This village will not be complicit in such a barbaric way!&quot; The elderly lady re-stated her stance again.</p><p>&quot;Then why do none of you admonish us for the deaths of the Nest soldiers? Why do you inherently feel that their deaths were deserved? Your freedom, your rights, your beliefs, and your identity can only be protected through strength. Through force! It is the force itself that had brought Nest to your doorstep, forcing you to the brink. Imagine if my Ghosts were not here. Would the village still be alive now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is your presence who brought them here! We never had a problem with them!&quot; One man replied.</p><p>&quot;Then what about a week from now? A month from now? Tenar Logging has been working for years now, and they aren't going to just remain satisfied with their current zones.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, bad luck for them!&quot; A mother taunted. &quot;It's not our fault that they can't go deeper because of the hogs!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then it was inevitable that they come for this village, a place where mammoth hogs rarely venture. Your demise was inevitable. How long are you going to let others step all over you? How long are you going to let yourself be swayed by the tide? Are you going to surrender yourself, willing to lose everything your ancestors and parents have struggled for, all because you do not want to fight? What would your father think? What would your mother have thought? What would you tell your children, when they ask you what happened to the village? That you gave yourself up willing and allowed yourself to be tortured, raped and beaten without so much as a whimper?&quot; Kyle berated them, his voice raised.</p><p>&quot;We will tell them that we stood for peace!&quot; The elderly lady pushed back, but she began to be acutely aware that the villagers around her were starting to switch over to Kyle's side.</p><p>Kyle scoffed. &quot;Stood for peace? Is that the excuse you will give your children and grandchildren when they find themselves born into slavery, forced to work menial labor for days and months on end without recompense, stuck in never-ending production lines and destroying their own bodies and health just so one man at the top can be rich? Can you say that to your grandchildren? Can you look them in the eye and tell them right now that they will be enslaved, forced to live in cramped rooms with nothing more than a meal a day, a collar, and a number as their only distinguishing feature? Who wants to be the first? Right now, your children stand here, listening!&quot; Kyle ended with a roar. &quot;If you want to stand for peace, turn yourself over right now to Nest, and relinquish control and ownership of every parcel of land you own here. Who will be the first?&quot;</p><p>Even the elderly lady found it hard to argue against that, unwilling to give up what she owned in the village. None of the villagers could, and many of them were unable to imagine a life without their house and land, which they knew was like the back of their hand. The terrible conditions of the refugee camps were also not new to them; everyone knew just how bad it could be. &quot;But if Nest comes back with a bigger force, we are bound to lose! We'll all die!&quot; A panicking mother tried to reason.</p><p>&quot;Then would you rather subject yourself and your family to decades of slavery and torture? Of imprisonment and punishment for something you did not do? Who here believes you are illegal squatters, that you do not have the legal right to live here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;FUCK NO!&quot; The first villager stepped forward. &quot;All of us were born here, our fathers and grandfathers before us, too! Like hell, I'm going to give up my home without a fight! I won't let my child be captured by Nest, not if I have a chance to stop it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then I will give you that chance. Join us, join the Ghosts of Versia, and defend your village! We will train you, equip you with the necessary tools to ensure your security, and this village will see prosperity unlike ever before! Goddess Nona said all men are equal under her, and so we shall fight on equal terms with Nest!&quot;</p><p>&quot;YEA!&quot; The majority of the villagers cheered in unison, those who did not still reluctant or pessimistic about their chances. Still, Kyle had already achieved his goal of securing the loyalty of the village, so long as he could protect it from Nest retribution. As the villagers cheered and smacked their chests with vigor, Kyle had Jaden and Feldon step up with him, explaining the steps.</p><p>&quot;Starting from today, we will work together to form a defense perimeter around the village. Traps, ditches, hiding spots. We will fight not in the village where our loved ones are, but amidst the forest where our advantage lies. Feldon and Jaden will coordinate the defense now, while Hayden will equip you with the necessary weapons. Feldon, you know what to do. Jaden, show him the terrain.&quot; Kyle handed it over, moving over to Drake.</p><p>&quot;I... I never thought the village could be brought back together like that.&quot; Drake was thoroughly impressed.</p><p>&quot;Not all of them are aligned. Some might try to betray us. But once our defenses are set up accordingly, we can work it out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But if Nest really comes with a bigger force...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then we will be ready by then. Now, we have to do what we must. I need those mammoth hogs hunted by the end of today.&quot; Kyle urged. The meat was crucial to having this entire plan work, and if he wanted to prevent a second Nest attack, he needed more manpower and equipment as well.</p><p>&quot;I understand. Follow me.&quot; Drake led Kyle back into his herbalist hut, Drake opening another cabinet to reveal a few pouches, inside which were Poair Leaves all grounded up, along with a strange purple powder sprinkled over them. &quot;This will make the hunting easier, but it's not easy to make this pouch. We only have five, and one is only enough for a single adult hog.&quot; Drake handed the pouch over to Kyle, who inspected it.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Lethargic Poair Leaves</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Poair Leaves combined with the spores of a Magneta Cap. Slows down the reaction speed of anyone who consumes it.</em></p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>Good. Time to commercialize some meat.</em></p><p><strong>Chapter 122 - Ruminations</strong></p><p>At the crack of dawn, Kyle and the other two Ghosts formed a squad with Drake, setting off deeper into the Keru Forest while Feldon and Jaden prepared the village defenses and trained the villagers. Sasha had been tasked by Kyle to work overwatch, serving as a long-range scout and an early warning system for any signs of Nest movements.</p><p>&quot;Are you sure just the four of us are going to be enough?&quot; Drake asked with an anxious undertone as he gingerly stepped over the ever-increasing twisting roots and ferns that grew larger and larger until they could barely see over them. The trees seemed to increase in size the deeper they went into the forest, as if there was a strange force making everything larger unnaturally.</p><p>&quot;We will be fine.&quot; Kyle assured, using his machete to hack away at a few pesky branches and plants that blocked his path. He was confident that he alone could take on a mammoth hog, though it was also essential to have the Ghosts become familiar with whatever hunting method Drake had in place.</p><p>As they ventured further, Kyle could feel a slight tingle on his skin, the density of arcia energy getting higher. While it was not as much as a training cave like the ones he implemented back in Raktor, it was significant enough that even the Ghosts were starting to feel the pressure, their bodies absorbing the ambient energy. Countless sparks of arcia energy blipped in and out of existence along the lengths of the tree trunks, faint lines that looked like engravings snaking their way up to the top.</p><p>Kyle leaned in closer, inspecting the very faint but dense capillaries that channeled arcia energy along the surface of the bark. He used his machete to slice open an already peeling piece of bark, revealing the fresh, moist interior of the tree, glistening with arcia-infused water, though the arcia energy of the water was lost rapidly through evaporation. Above him, the canopy of leaves, flowers, and birds hiding amidst the growth felt a cool breeze, arcia energy dissipating out through the air via the surface area of the leaves. <em>Interesting, the lifeforms here have truly adapted to arcia energy as if it was just another facet of life.</em></p><p>He was not too surprised - exotic materials found on planets always had their own unique ecosystem, though most of them were highly incompatible even with bioformed humans. To see arcia be able to integrate with well-known Ancient Earth lifeforms is nothing short of a technological miracle. <em>The trees draw arcia energy and water up from the base, breathing it in and then breathing it out through the leaves. It's the same water cycle as usual, except arcia energy is also being diffused this way.</em></p><p>The squad continued along the trek, the trees still dense as ever as they watched every step, careful not to crack any branches and alert anything that might be stalking them. Strangely enough, Kyle noticed that there were a few outcrops positioned further away along a sloping hill randomly, as though they had been sprinkled through artificially. None of the outcrops' locations matched any other geological formations, but Drake warned Kyle to keep a clear berth of the lucrative iron ore deposits. &quot;You don't want to mess with whatever is eating that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eating?&quot; Kyle cocked his head in confusion, but Drake placed a finger on his own lips, motioning for Kyle to crouch and keep quiet. He used the same finger to point over his shoulder, marking a solitary mammoth hog, grazing along the trees slowly.</p><p>The two Ghosts gasped before clutching their own mouths, astounded by the size of the hog. &quot;No one told me it would be this big!&quot; The mammoth hog truly lived up to its name, towering more than three stories high on all fours, while three snouts that acted like elephant trunks gave it a surprising dexterity, allowing it to pluck and strip bushes before stuffing leaves into its mouth, five large molars gnashing it before the pulverized leaves entered its digestive system of five stomachs.</p><p>Kyle wasn't too fazed by the size but more so by the ability for it to even exist. <em>The gravity on this planet is Earth-like - such a creature would be horribly inefficient and succumb to its own weight if toppling... the only explanation is the availability of arcia energy.</em> He kept low as he crawled along the forest floor, moving up with Drake to get a closer look. The three trunks were the width of a human, giant fingers that made the front of the hog look like an octopus. Its forehead featured a large pointy horn, its bony surface orange in color from the oxidization, only accented by natural engravings shaping along its length.</p><p>The mammoth hog snorted through all three of its trunks, acting akin to a vacuum cleaner for some decomposing leaves, clearing up the forest floor as it lumbered along, moving away from the squad. Kyle was about to continue following, but Drake instead motioned for him to retreat. The squad moved back quietly, until Drake was sure that they were out of earshot of the hog. &quot;Okay, here's the plan. There's a place nearby where the hogs usually come to graze every day. We'll lay the bait there, and wait for the hog to eat it up. Once we are sure the bait has taken effect, then we'll strike.&quot; Drake used a nearby branch and carved a plan out into the dirt.</p><p>Kyle nodded, deferring judgment to Drake, who was the experienced hunter here. Personally, Kyle would have called in an airstrike to lay waste to the forest and form a clearing to hunt the hogs better, but alas, his options were limited. He watched on as Drake scattered the laced Poair Leaves along the floor, forming a pile of delicious leaves that no mammoth hog would be able to resist. As Drake returned to them, he suddenly walked to a nearby stream, scooping and slathering himself with mud. &quot;We need to mask our smell - the hog can detect us from a mile away if we're not careful.&quot;</p><p>No one complained, masking themselves before the four of them separated, each of them climbing up the tree and taking up a hiding position. &quot;Its sense of smell are really good, but only where its trunks are facing. Other than that, anything directly above where the trunk can't reach is basically a blind spot. Trick is to stay along the branches of the tree if you can help it. The weak point is the head.&quot; Drake explained.</p><p>A few minutes passed in silence, only the chittering of insects and birds masking the rustling of leaves in the wind and the sound of running water along smaller streams. Kyle took this time to inspect the environment, noticing the insects were the size of a toddler, skittering along the branches and leaves, some of them even using their feelers, which waved about in front of Kyle, trying to determine friend or foe.</p><p>One of the beetles that scampered past him had a strange engraving on its shell, the engraving lighting up when direct daylight shone right on it. The beetle found a perfect spot, laying there to rest and soak in the incoming radiation, its shell growing larger over time until the tail end of it snapped off, revealing the fleshy exoskeleton of the beetle beneath. It used its maw to grab the dropped shell, scampering to a hole in the tree and placing the shell neatly, apparently using it to cover its nest.</p><p>Kyle wanted to catch the beetle to see if the System would show any information about the engraving, but a large thud alerted him to the same mammoth hog, having turned around thanks to the scent emitted by the bait. He watched from above as the hog shuffled slowly, its three trunks continuously scanning the area through smell and touch both, its large beady eyes also looking around cautiously.</p><p>The first of its trunks sniffed the pile of laced leaves when it approached, the other two keeping at bay, ready to lash out at any nearby predator. Kyle and the others kept completely still, the trunks trying to sniff out their locations. He could see one of the trunks get near to him, sniffing and snorting, before it retracted, satisfied. Without any more hesitation, the first trunk scooped up the entire pile of leaves, stuffing it into its maw while it chewed away happily.</p><p>Kyle spotted Drake moving out from beyond his hiding position, his hand still held up with a stop sign, Drake's eyes intently watching the hog's movement. The hog didn't seem to be affected, continuing to chew and loiter about the area, its curious trunks still wiggling about. However, the mammoth hog suddenly stumbled over an obvious root, one it should have avoided. This was the sign that Drake needed. &quot;NOW!&quot;</p><p>The three of them popped out from their hiding positions, the two Ghosts using their Aspis MK2 Repeater to fire a hailstorm at the hog. While the hide of the hog was tough, it was far from enough to deflect the pellets entirely, many lodging themselves deep into the hog's flesh as it roared in pain, its three trunks suddenly letting out a sonic horn-like sound that blasted the two Ghosts off their branches. They tumbled down hard, crashing through branches and trees that broke their fall before collapsing onto the floor, bruised everywhere as they struggled to get up to their feet.</p><p>The mammoth hog charged towards them, its three tusks aimed at grabbing them, when a sudden projectile was shot towards the back of its head, an explosive round erupting and tearing through the hide easily with the ensuing explosion, sparks flying everywhere and causing leaves to smolder. Kyle slung the empty railgun behind him, drawing out his machete and leaping downwards onto the back of the injured hog.</p><p>Stumbling clumsily, the intoxicated and injured hog staggered through the forest, trying to limp away while Kyle landed right on top of it. A trunk swooped in from the front, attempting to remove Kyle off its back. Clenching his armored fist, the exosuit arm whirred into life as he drove the machete upwards in a devastating swing, timed exactly to slice the trunk cleanly off in one hit.</p><p>The mammoth hog recoiled in pain, letting out a series of grunts and whimpers while its trunk bled blue, dripping downwards in copious amounts from the severed wound. Kyle raised his machete, about to drive deep into the hog, when its horn began to glow brighter, its original orange hue blinding Kyle temporarily, causing him to nearly lose balance and fall off the back of the hog.</p><p>He clenched his eyes tight, trying to regain his vision. As soon as he opened it again, he saw the same severed trunk lunging back towards him, except that it was regenerating in real time. He swung his machete again towards the trunk, but felt his machete crack against the now hardened trunk, the tip having only regrown a bone spear. <em>What?</em></p><p>Kyle ducked as the bone spear jabbed across him, skidding along the back of the hog while its legs threw a tantrum, trying to throw off Kyle. &quot;Hit the eyes, the eyes!&quot; Drake called out from afar, not having any weapon to be able to deal with it.</p><p>Thanks to Kyle's attack, the two Ghosts had enough time to heal up and rejoin the fight. They focused their fire on the eyes, one of the barraging pellets finding its mark and shattering the crystal-like structure of the beady left eye, earning yet another deafening pained roar from the hog.</p><p>With its sight now blinded, the hog relied only on its sense of smell and hearing, flinging its trunks wildly in a desperate attempt to shake off Kyle on its back as well as crush the two Ghosts. It navigated towards the fired shots of the two Ghosts, charging forward with its horn facing forward, the trunks sweeping outwards like an grader, smacking everything in its path.</p><p>The two Ghosts leaped over the trunks on the ground, tumbling and rolling into a shooting posture once more, though the back of the hog had no weak spots to shoot at. They witnessed yet another glow of the orange hue, the remaining two trunks now also growing sharp bone ends to their snout. Interestingly, none of the tips were the same - the first was a spear, the other was a hammer, and the last was a mace.</p><p>Kyle fended off the attacks, dodging and clinging onto the hairy hide of the hog as he clutched with both his hands, pulling himself forward towards the horn, resisting the constant shaking and slamming of the hog, which was trying everything. Over time, the hog's actions began to be more and more sluggish, allowing Kyle to easily reach the horn. Wielding his machete, he aimed at the base of the horn, using his exosuit arm to slam the machete deep beyond the hide, gouging out whatever flesh and organs were in the hog's head.</p><p>The hog's trunks twitched slightly as the machete's blade reached its brain, the nervous system control disrupted while its motions were no longer coordinated, tripping over itself. It rolled onto the floor, flinging Kyle off while it tumbled towards a nearby tree, the hog crashing into it violently and bending the stiff tree trunk slightly.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p><p></p><p><em>Only fifty?</em> Kyle wiped the sweat and blue-splattered blood off his face. The noxious salamander he had defeated in the dungeon was far more worth in terms of experience. Sure, the hog was not as hard, but it still took great effort to bring it down just due to its sheer mess. \</p><p>Drake clambered down the tree where he was watching, cautiously approaching the hog, unsure whether it was dead or not, the two Ghosts sharing his sentiment as they held their rifles at the ready.</p><p>&quot;It's dead, don't worry.&quot; Kyle didn't waste any time, moving forward to check the mammoth hog. He hacked through the hide, revealing a red, tender flesh beneath that was dense and packed, the arcia energy already dissipating into the air.</p><p>&quot;I can't believe you killed it so easily! Usually, we have to go a few rounds with the hog, and we're lucky that this adult was alone. Though, it is a little bit on the smaller side now that I look at it carefully.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Smaller side?!&quot; A Ghost blurted out in astonishment.</p><p>&quot;Well now we know the method to hunt them, we should be good enough to start scaling up.&quot; Kyle remarked, chopping off a piece of the tender meat into his hand.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Mammoth Hog Trotter Meat</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A meat worthy for giants.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Requires detoxification through smoking.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>&quot;It wont be that easy.&quot; Drake shook his head, motioning to the two pouches filled with Lethargic Poair Leaves that he had on him. &quot;We'll need way more of this to properly hunt them. Otherwise we'll be constantly fighting them at full strength.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Poair Leaves should be easy enough to forage for,&quot; Kyle replied.</p><p>&quot;That's easier said than done - its growing pattern is sporadic at best, it won't be easy to find, not to mention the lack of Magneta Caps here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And where would you find them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Those outcrops we saw before? There are caves beneath that have them. Very rarely do they grow on the surface, they love the underground much more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They love the underground...&quot; Kyle pondered on it while the two Ghosts gingerly touched the legs of the dead mammoth hog, still in awe at the size of what they had just killed. &quot;That's good enough for now. Let's head back to the village.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But how are we going to-&quot; Drake's words were stuck in their throat as he watched Kyle merciless carve through the leg expertly, ripping it off and lifting it up with his exosuit arm.</p><p>&quot;Stay here and make sure nothing else eats the corpse.&quot; Kyle channeled his energy into his thighs, sprinting hard through the forest while hauling the mammoth's hindleg on his back, easily dashing through the trees and leaping over roots, the route fresh in his mind. What took them an hour to trek was cleared in just ten minutes, Kyle hardly breaking a sweat thanks to his 229-A-X package.</p><p>&quot;Holy shit! But it took us ten days to hunt the last time round!&quot; Jaden exclaimed in shock when he spotted Kyle walking back victorious. The hindleg was more than enough proof to the villagers, Kyle sending them off to cut up and gather the corpse back into more workable chunks. Soon, over the next hour, more than 6000 kg of meat alone was harvested, accounting for 55% of the entire hog's corpse. &quot;Don't toss away the bone yet, we can reuse it to form spikes for traps!&quot; Feldon reminded them.</p><p>Kyle did some simple calculations in his head. If he could bring back all six thousand kilogram of meat back, he could feed almost eight thousand refugees in a single week, assuming they consumed an average of seven hundred grams of meat each. Sure, meat wasn't enough on its own, but Kyle knew it would be more than enough to recruit and lure manpower to his side.</p><p>With each refugee he recruited, he would be able to scale up the hunting operation. <em>The only problem is the lack of Magneta Cap. But instead of finding a way to drug the hogs, we should be finding a way to improve our firepower.</em> Kyle wanted a railgun that could kill the hog in a single hit if aimed right, but even in its current form, a simple basic arcia crystal did not have enough strength to do so.</p><p>Thankfully, there were already hints of a solution with Hayden, who was now working overtime in her own house's workshop to make weapons for the villagers, using Feldon's Aspis MK2 Repeater as the reference. Her original self-doubt and unwillingness to participate in any conflict had now been swayed by Kyle and the village as a whole. With the appearance of the Ghosts of Versia, Hayden did not feel as hopeless before, now finding a drive to put her skills to work in order to get back at Harrison.</p><p>As Kyle entered the workshop, Hayden was fully engrossed in studying the engravings and improvements that Kyle had made to the rifle. &quot;Who taught you how to etch? Did you go to the University of Raktor?&quot; Hayden asked curiously. &quot;The concept behind these guns are truly unique, I've never seen... well never even heard of some of the methods you used to engrave this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I read a few books on my own,&quot; Kyle replied nonchalantly, placing the railgun in front of Hayden's workbench. &quot;I know you know how to refine the arcia crystals.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Such a process is extremely dangerous, and I wouldn't recommend doing it. It could easily go wrong, especially in such an experimental weapon like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yet you have the village children playing with a whole bag of it.&quot; Kyle snorted. &quot;And this is hardly experimental - its design is sound. I need to increase the projectile's damage dealt in order to hunt the hogs more effectively.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm.... &quot; Hayden did a brief inspection of the railgun. &quot;No, not possible. Not with these engravings - the traces are now too small to handle such a large influx of energy, which may cause arcia deviation. You certainly don't want your gun turning to ice cream halfway through a battle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suspected as much. But I wasn't talking about the railgun. I was talking about the projectile itself.&quot; Kyle placed an example of the explosive projectile he was using, the engraving simple enough for Hayden to immediately understand what it does.</p><p>&quot;So the projectile converts its own mass into energy that explodes outwards on contact, intriguing. But to hunt the hog, you want it to penetrate. I think I got just the idea.&quot; Hayden pulled out a piece of paper, sketching furiously and quickly. Her skills as an engineer were apparent, being able to draw to scale with accurate dimensioning and labeling for clear representation, even providing sectional cuts, albeit roughly. &quot;How's this? We'll have the projectile be two-tiered. But in order to activate the second tier, you will need an additional source of ener-&quot; Hayden stopped herself mid-sentence. &quot;So this is why you want the refined arcia crystals. Aren't you afraid that you might overcook the hog from within if you do this?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not going to be using basic arcia crystals like what you have, but the poor ones. This way, the internal explosion will only be limited to a specific area where it hits.&quot; Kyle showed Hayden a poor arcia crystal. &quot;Can you do it? Just come up with the design, and I'll handle the production.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot; Hayden nodded, getting to work immediately while Kyle left back to the village. As soon as he stepped out of the door, he saw Jaden grinning widely from ear to ear.</p><p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; Kyle squinted his eyes in suspicion.</p><p>&quot;I... I want to join the Ghosts!&quot; Jaden bowed. &quot;I'll even give up the 5% of meat I asked for! Please train me; I want to be as strong as you!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's not possible.&quot; Kyle immediately dismissed him.</p><p>&quot;Wha-what?! Weren't you looking for Ghosts to recruit? That's why you were hunting the hogs, right?&quot; Jaden was confused.</p><p>&quot;I was referring to you being as strong as me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, if I train hard enough, I can -&quot; Jaden stuttered as Kyle suddenly grabbed him by the throat, lifting him up with his legs dangling in the air wildly.</p><p>&quot;Still want to be a Ghost? This isn't a game. This is life and death. You will suffer horrible things, and witness devastation far beyond this small pitiful region. And once you join, there is no turning back. If you ever decide to leave, you will be hung and executed before you leak any secrets. Are you sure you want to be a Ghost?&quot; Kyle glared at the young man.</p><p>Jaden struggled to breathe, but there was a fire in his eyes as he nodded vigorously to Kyle, though he was unable to speak freely. Kyle let go, dropping Jaden to the ground as Jaden gasped sharply, breathing hard.</p><p>&quot;Good. Report to Feldon that I have accepted you as a Ghost. Try not to die.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-y-yes, sir! I won't let you down!&quot; Jaden saluted sloppily, having not learned much decorum as a villager for the better part of his life. Kyle ignored him, instead walking off to the center of the village to oversee the meat processing.</p><p>The villagers were well accustomed to handling the mammoth hog meat, ignoring the blue blood and strong scent of the meat while hacking away at the flesh, chopping them up into strips and tossing them onto a woven straw mat. Two men hauled the meat into a smoking chamber, the meat idling for three hours at a high temperature before it was ready to be cooked further and consumed.</p><p>Kyle then had a few villagers gear up with him, preparing to return to the refugee camp en masse. Each of them had backpacks filled to the brim with meat, totaling a thousand kilograms of smoked meat that could be kept for a while. He led them back the same path Jaden had shown him, avoiding the Nest checkpoints under the cover of night and sneaking back. However, even from a distance, Kyle could tell that something was not right with the refugee camp.</p><p>All along the main road, torches, and arctech lanterns could be seen stretching towards the horizon, and the stream of incoming refugees only increased. More and more of them were coming from Ocra, and the desperation in their eyes was even stronger than ever, unlike those Kyle had seen a few days ago. Interestingly enough, he spotted a Versian soldier covering his uniform with a tattered robe, hiding among the refugees, attempting to sneak past anyone checking and entering the refugee camp.</p><p>He focused on the current task, bringing the meat back to the Ghost hideout and surprising Diya. &quot;Ho-Wha-&quot; She fumbled her words, unable to come to terms with the sacks of meat being unloaded by the villagers, Kyle organizing the Ghosts to pack them into crates for storage in a cool, dry place.</p><p>&quot;That's not possible; it's only been two days!&quot; Diya couldn't come to terms with it. Whatever Kyle had just done put every bribery and deal she had to cut with the guards to shame, making her wonder what the hell she had been doing for the past few months.</p><p>&quot;I told you. You have the skills, just not the vision.&quot; Kyle shrugged. &quot;Besides, this is only one-sixth of a hog. We'll get the rest when we've established a proper route.&quot;</p><p>Diya nearly fainted upon hearing that. With the amount of meat now available, it was basically a given that the Ghosts wouldn't be running out of food anymore. Still, this was not Kyle's end goal.</p><p>&quot;Have the meat be distributed to those who are willing to join us. Do not distribute flyers, only recruit in person, and don't let any of the Desham guards see you.&quot; Kyle instructed the Ghosts. &quot;We want this movement to grow, but only deep undercover. I only want fighters - priority are mercenaries and former soldiers, if any, or young men who are fit to be trained. We only have a short amount of time before we are able to launch any attack.&quot;</p><p>Even Diya's Ghosts were not antagonistic towards Kyle any longer, having seen how he had personally solved their own food crisis. &quot;How many do we recruit?&quot; One of the Ghost in the hideout asked.</p><p>&quot;As many as you can. I want at least five hundred.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Five hundred?! Are you trying to take on the army?&quot; Diya spluttered. &quot;Such a large force would definitely have leaks and spies among them. There could be those who join us only for the food offered, but sell the information to the Desham guards.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And that's why I have you in charge here. You know most of the locals, work with those you trust.&quot; Kyle nodded towards her. &quot;Now, let's get to work.&quot;</p><p>The next three days saw a flurry of action amidst the Ghosts, with meat now regularly delivered from the village. An improved projectile from Hayden now allowed anyone with a railgun to shoot a hog dead on sight, assuming they were able to withstand the recoil. Feldon was trained by Sasha to use it proficiently, before he trained others in turn. By the end of the third day, Feldon was competent enough to at least maim a hog on his own, while the rest of the villagers and Ghosts were playing clean-up. They also harvested Poair Leaves along the way, stocking them up while Drake continued to produce healing potions for the Ghosts and village to use in case of another battle.</p><p>In the refugee camp of Desham, recruitment was going strong. Food was a critical factor in their joining, though word did not spread due to the policy of only recruiting in person. New recruits enjoyed smoked meat alongside their daily rations, allowing them to regain their strength. Those selected were either former guards in their village, mercenaries, adventurers, or even former Versian soldiers who had deserted the army. All of them were dissatisfied with the current status quo in Versia, naturally aligning with the goal of the Ghosts.</p><p>Diya could visibly see the Ghost cell grow and develop rapidly, expanding at a rate that she could have hardly fathom a week before Kyle's arrival. Still, she was up for the job, managing and handling the training of the Ghosts as well as the distribution of supplies, becoming a proper Ghost leader within the three days, and no longer questioning Kyle. &quot;Just... just how are you doing all of this?&quot; Diya couldn't help asking, curious and hungry to learn the secrets to Kyle's apparent success and inherent ability to lead and organize.</p><p>&quot;Looks like you're finally coming around.&quot; Kyle raised his eyebrows. &quot;I thought you would still be reluctant for a few more months.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I finally see how dumb I have been, content to laze around in my own benefits when there were bigger things to achieve and grab. With such a growing force, we could take over the whole of Desham!&quot;</p><p>&quot;In due time, yes. But as soon as we make a move, Harrison will come calling in a heartbeat to crush us. We must wait for the right moment to strike. Since you're interested in how I am doing all of this, why don't you try to predict what I will do in the coming days?&quot;</p><p>Diya pondered, tapping her chin in deep thought. &quot;I think you would wait for another two weeks until the refugee camp has built up a critical mass and the new Ghosts we're training have been prepared enough. We'll attack in the night and try to cut off all communication instantly by hitting any arctech radio repeater or extender tower. We could also jam the city. Then, we'll strike the military garrison head-on along with the city council, removing them from power.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All well and good, though not exactly the right strategy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not the right strategy...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Instead of waiting two weeks, we strike in two days' time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?!&quot; Diya exclaimed in shock. &quot;But you said that we needed to wait for the right time, otherwise Harrison will come to crush us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He won't. He'll have bigger things to worry about by then. It's been seven days since the Grand Exhibition, and neither side is going to linger around for much longer. Have you not noticed the influx of deserting soldiers trying to pose as refugees? They know what's coming, and they are running, afraid. Because in two days' time, Count Leon will launch a-&quot;</p><p>Before Kyle could complete his words, a panicking Ghost suddenly interrupted them, sliding down the ladder hastily, his face aghast with disbelief. &quot;There's trouble among the refugees; it won't be long before they raise another riot!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Why?&quot; Diya asked hurriedly.</p><p>&quot;There's word spreading among some of the refugees that the war has started. Harrison launched a first-strike attack on Count Leon!&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 123 - Overpopulation</strong></p><p>The word of the war spread like wildfire, igniting thousands of refugees to flee Ocra in droves uncountable, their trail never-ending as they tried their luck. Many who felt they would not be able to get into Tenar headed for other cities in Versia or even remote towns, seeking safety further away from the conflict. However, Ocra did not experience a drop in population, but instead, an increase as evacuations of surrounding villages became more and more frequent, with once stalwart village defenders now fleeing for the cities.</p><p>Waves upon waves of refugees ravaged the countryside, their hunger and desperation driving each step while they scavenged through every field and forest they entered. Some met an unfortunate death deep in the Keru Forest, while large swaths of farms were decimated by the sheer numbers the farmers faced, many not having the requisite guards to defend such a horde. The refugees shambled along like groups of mindless zombies, devouring everything in their path. Trash and excretion were left behind, marking their path as they traveled along the major road.</p><p>The terrible conditions of the refugee camps had pushed many young men and women to join the Versian army, but some of them merely joined in order to receive their rations and skive off training, hiding wherever they could and skirting around the rules by exploiting the lack of trainers. However, as soon as the war begun, a minority deserted the army, unwilling to be sent to the frontline to die as cannon fodder. They hid themselves amidst the refugees, avoiding detection and joining the throng.</p><p>Others found employment under Harrison Industries. The few lucky ones found valuable positions among the engineers or technicians, while the bulk were forced into slave workshops and factories in Desham, Creuliz, and the underground of Tenar. Some who managed to escape captivity were only laughed at and sent back to where they came from by the police and guards. &quot;Slavery doesn't exist any longer in Versia!&quot; was the usual response.</p><p>It was this rising tide of dissatisfaction, this growing swelling force of anger and unrest, that Kyle sought to manipulate to his own goals here in Desham. <em>I never expected Harrison to strike first. If he wins, he will be able to push to Raktor proper within a month.</em> He made a few assumptions, trying to simulate the battle at the border of Ocra to the best of his ability.</p><p>Harrison had a smaller army in general, but he did have better technology on his side in the form of Project Aurtla, which allowed him air superiority. Unless Count Leon was also hiding information regarding his military capabilities, he saw no feasible way for Count Leon's troops to shoot down the planes. If his assumption was correct, Harrison's planes may be able to achieve flight at one-kilometer altitude above ground, or three thousand kilometers at best. This would put it far beyond the range of his Aspis MK1 Repeaters that were currently produced for Count Leon, the pellets losing much of their kinetic energy through the air before they could even touch the plane's surface.</p><p>Still, this presented him with a clear opportunity. <em>With Harrison now busy on the frontlines, it means his army is preoccupied with that. Hopefully for long.</em> Kyle immediately called all of the Ghosts together, even those who were still training as fresh recruits. As soon as they had gathered, Kyle announced his next steps. &quot;In three days, we strike. There's no time to waste when a golden opportunity has been handed to us.&quot;</p><p>The Ghosts were all shocked. &quot;How do we strike with just two dozen of us, and only a few trained?!&quot; One of the Ghosts exclaimed. &quot;The garrison of Desham numbers in the hundreds, there's no way we'll be able to fight all of them!&quot;</p><p>Kyle held a knowing smile on his face, the plan already clear. &quot;We won't be the only ones in town fighting for Desham.&quot;</p><p>@@@@@</p><p><em>Two days later...</em></p><p>Locals of Desham would remember that nights used to be dark and quiet. Instead, those who lived within the city could only hear random shouts and retching sounds from the refugee camps, many refugees suffering from food poisoning or dysentery that was spreading rapidly. Countless of them had no place to stay, simply sleeping outside, while the more opportunistic ones looked for naive, unsuspecting people, trying to steal their rations. Even with all of this happening, streams of refugees were still coming in, their torches burning bright in the night, stretching all towards the horizon.</p><p>An officer looked on in dismay from the top of the walls, right above the gate mechanism. He shook his head at the sight of the refugee camp, looking over his shoulder to see a guard yawning, his eyes tired from the long shift. &quot;Hey, you. Stay alert! Anything could happen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-y-es, sir!&quot; The lethargic guard snapped awake, rubbing his eyes hard while staring intently forward. The officer let out a frustrated sigh, about to leave the wall and climb down the stairs, when the lethargic guard motioned towards him. &quot;Uhm, Officer Gabriel?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I was wondering if you could uhm... spare me more food. I'm more than willing to give up my tenars if it means I can get more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Isn't the daily rations enough?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, but... to be honest. It has been dwindling month by month. The last two weeks have shown significant decreases. My wife is having a baby soon, and I was hoping to get some extra just for her.&quot; The lethargic guard held a sheepish smile, looking around nervously.</p><p>&quot;I don't control the food rationing, its the Governor and the council.&quot; Officer Gabriel patted the guard's shoulder slowly. &quot;I can try, but no guarantees.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you, sir, that means a lot to me.&quot; The guard bowed respectfully, while Officer Gabriel descended the stairs. As he reached the base, he noticed a hooded man waiting for him, his gnarly white hands barely visible through the sleeves of his brown-like robe.</p><p>&quot;Officer Gabriel. Your presence has been requested by the Governor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Understood.&quot; Officer Gabriel walked with purpose, moving down the empty cobblestone streets while the hooded man matched his pace. &quot;Any information on the recent incident in the Keru Forest? Have you found out who is doing it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We might have a lead. We've been expanding our observations, and there seem to be a few villagers transporting meat during the night. They are escorted by armed men, and there have already been a few skirmishes. However, there's not enough manpower to spare. If you could just allocate one platoon -&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't have the luxury to allocate one platoon.&quot; Officer Gabriel snapped. &quot;You're Nest, for crying out loud. It's your job to make sure that the Keru Forest logging zones are protected!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And they still are. I fear there is a rebel movement growing among the refugee camps, fuelled by the transportation of meat from within the Keru Forest. All scouts we have sent that way have never returned. If we're talking about responsibilities, then it is your job to make sure the refugee camps are under control.&quot; The hooded man asserted his stance.</p><p>&quot;Have you seen the number of refugees? Even my five platoons are not enough to control them if they decide to rise up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will squash any rebellious elements before they even have the chance to appear.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So be it.&quot; The hooded man from Nest didn't push any further. The rest of their walk was in silence as they approached the town hall, its lights still on while sounds of partying could be heard from within, loud dancing music echoing. The two of them entered through the main door, seeing an entire lavish banquet being thrown for the factory owners and councilors of the city, chit-chatting with each other while skimpily dressed girls danced on a stage, singing along with the music.</p><p>Officer Gabriel eyed the scrumptious spread of food all laid out along a long dining table, the attendees eating away and enjoying the food. Many of them did not finish their plates, throwing the rest of the food away into a bin and getting the waiters and servants to clean up the wasted food. He closed one eye to the apparent lack of understanding of Desham's current condition, recalling his position solely as a military officer and approaching the Governor himself.</p><p>The Governor was a well-toned man, a big Euria pipe in his mouth with his hair slicked back, a girl on each arm as he rested against a velvet couch, laughing heartedly while swirling a glass of wine in his right hand that was adorned with rings. &quot;Would you believe that I got this ring from a refugee? The dealer told me he got it for merely two potatoes. TWO! HAH, what a ruckus!&quot; The Governor roared with laughter and slapped his thighs, the girls and nearby sycophants all sniggering along with him.</p><p>&quot;Governor, you called for me?&quot; Officer Gabriel interrupted his storytelling, saluting the governor while the hooded man stood next to him.</p><p>&quot;Ah, Officer Gabriel. How good of you to finally show up.&quot; The Governor let out a burp, his breath reeking of alcohol. &quot;Now, here's the question of the day - WHY ARE THE DUMB REFUGEES STILL AT MY DOORS?&quot; He suddenly roared, frightening the girls as he slammed his leather shoes on the ground hard, the click of sole echoing through the banquet hall and piercing through the music.</p><p>Officer Gabriel glanced around, noticing that no one was moving to stop the Governor. He took a deep breath, steeling himself. &quot;Governor, sir. Surely, you must understand that under the Constitution of Versia, we are legally required to offer assistance to any and all Versians, regardless of race, language, or religion. These refugees come from Ocra, and they all are in dire need of -&quot;</p><p>His answer was interrupted by a splash of red wine hitting his face head-on, the Governor having tossed it from his glass. &quot;And there's my answer. How's that, hmm?&quot;</p><p>Officer Gabriel did not wipe away the wine from his face, instead bearing the stares and mocking laughter from other attendees who saw his hair dripping wet. &quot;Sir, whether or not you splash me with wine does not change the fact that we have to help them as soon as we can. In order to prevent any rebellious charge, we should attempt to integrate them into our city and-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I WILL NOT TOLERATE LEECHES ENTERING MY CITY!&quot; The Governor bellowed. &quot;They are scum, fickle-minded dirty little creatures who only know how to beg and laze the entire day away. Tell me, how is the recruitment of workers for our factories and Tenar Logging? Perhaps you can illuminate their efficacy for us, Mister Vicorn.&quot; He motioned towards the hooded man, his old wrinkled face now clearly visible under the bright lights of the banquet hall.</p><p>&quot;Governor, sir. You are exactly right. Despite the refugees having increased in numbers in the hundreds on a daily basis, many are still refusing to sign up for the Versian Army, nor are they willing to take up job roles for many of our facilities and employment opportunities. They are most derisive of your kind offering to them.&quot; Vicorn bowed respectfully.</p><p>&quot;Did you hear that, Officer Gabriel? There was a chance offered to them, a way out from their dire situation - one that everyone in this city understands. Work or starve. The rules have never changed for us since I grew up here on the farm, why does it have to change for these lazy bums now, all looking for free food to eat, yet doing nothing at all?!&quot;</p><p><em>Because the employment opportunities are akin to slavery.</em> Still, Officer Gabriel somewhat agreed, knowing that the refugees could easily join the Versian army and be trained fully. Sure, he understood that not everyone wanted to fight, but he couldn't deny that a way out had been offered for them. &quot;You're right, Governor, but even if we do not want to let them in, we should find some other method of appeasing them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are the rations we provide not enough? They have already done enough damage to the farms around them! We won't be seeing another harvest for six more months if they continue to rip out and destroy everything we have done to the soil.&quot; The Governor scoffed with a derisive expression. &quot;Such ungrateful beings, isn't that right, girls?&quot; The girls giggled and nodded in agreement.</p><p>Officer Gabriel was about to offer his opinion once more when Vicorn interjected. &quot;Governor, you are exactly right about this. Despite your good graces and donations of rations, the refugees have been terrorizing the Keru Forest in search of additional food to sate their never-ending greed. In fact, we suspect a quickly growing rebel movement that seeks to destabilize Desham. We have received good information on a route for hunting being set up, feeding refugees in the camps directly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?! They are harvesting food from the forest?&quot; The Governor's face paled.</p><p>Officer Gabriel saw what Vicorn was aiming for, quickly interrupting as fast as he could, &quot;Governor, that should be a good thing. If the refugees' hunger is met, then there would be less of a chance for them to rebel-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Idiot!&quot; The Governor waved his right hand animatedly. &quot;If they have enough food, then how will I amass my collection of rare jewelry? I got this for two potatoes!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly, Governor.&quot; Vicorn fuelled the flames. &quot;The refugees no longer want to rely on your rations alone. They see you as a laughing stock and plan to be self-sufficient while hoarding everything of worth to them.&quot;</p><p>Gabriel's eyes widened in horror. &quot;Governor, surely you can't be thinking about-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Food is a currency here, Officer Gabriel. And I am its richest king from the horizon to here!&quot; The Governor stretched out his hand. &quot;Those loyal to me will receive their due rewards, but those who dare to reject my hand and seek out alternative sources will feel my wrath. Do you work for me, or do you and your family want to join the refugees? Officer Gabriel! Receive your orders!&quot;</p><p>Officer Gabriel wanted to retort, but stuck to his ingrained military decorum, hardened over the last ten years as he stood at attention, his face and upper uniform still soaked in red wine.</p><p>&quot;You are to immediately sweep and search the refugee camps for this source of meat. Find them and confiscate them - I want all food that isn't our rations to be placed in our silos or storage. If you need a reason, explain to the refugees that the food they foraged is either dangerous, toxic, or medically unsafe. Do you understand?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. I will find the meat from Keru Forest and -&quot;</p><p>&quot;NOT JUST THE MEAT!&quot; The Governor slammed his hand on the table in front of him. &quot;I'm only going to repeat myself once: I want every food that is not OUR ration to be confiscated. Are we clear, or do I have to resort to other punitive measures?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No sir, I have received my orders.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm... that does not sound convincing enough. Vicorn. I'll have you in charge as well. Use whatever tactics you need. If Officer Gabriel is unwilling to carry out his orders, you will carry it out in his stead. Strip him of his rank and have his family handed to the refugees. I’m sure they will be more than happy to receive more into the ranks.&quot;</p><p>Officer Gabriel was stunned, noticing Vicorn already had a grinning smile on his old, wrinkled face. <em>He planned for all of this to happen. He wants a bigger control of the city by sucking up to the damn Governor!</em></p><p>&quot;Well, what are you two waiting for? Go, do it now!&quot;</p><p>Officer Gabriel didn't expect it to happen immediately, hoping he could try to convince the Governor otherwise. &quot;Governor, perhaps we should wait till dawn to give the refugees some ample warning abou-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Vicorn!&quot; The Governor motioned with his hand. &quot;You know what to do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do I have full command over the garrison, Governor?&quot; Vicorn smiled.</p><p>&quot;If you do what I ask, then yes, you have it now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Governor, this I will not stand for. Vicorn is a member of the public and not sworn into an officer role. He cannot be tasked to lead a military force.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I AM THE KING HERE, AND YOU WILL LISTEN! OR I CAN STRIP YOU OF YOUR POSITION, AND YOU AND YOUR FAMILY CAN LANGUISH IN JAIL!&quot; The Governor wasn't taking any more criticism from Officer Gabriel, forcing the officer to immediately back down in submission.</p><p>Gabriel and Vicorn left immediately, Vicorn still having that irritating grin on his face. &quot;Bad luck, officer. Looks like I am in charge now. Just sit back and see how it's done.&quot;</p><p>If Gabriel had a choice, he would have resigned on the spot, but he knew his family would be in trouble. <em>I just have to hold out, hold out long enough. I can't afford to lose my position.</em> &quot;There's no need to. I will carry out the orders.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Didn't you hear the Governor? I have full rights to take charge of the garrison!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You wanted your one platoon, yes? Don't step on my toes, and you will have your requested reinforcements once this operation is over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So be it. But if you falter even once, I'm taking control immediately.&quot; Vicorn shrugged, content to let Officer Gabriel handle the situation. &quot;My men will also participate in the operation whenever you begin.&quot; Vicorn left him, returning to his Nest hideout to prepare.</p><p>Gabriel headed to the military garrison at the corner of the city, a simple small fort where the barracks and armory were held securely behind armored walls. As soon as Gabriel reached his office, he got a guard on duty to report to his office immediately. &quot;Wake everyone up. I want them lined up in the square in ten minutes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;..sir? It's already close to midnight. Do you mean the night shift or the -&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean everyone. Now. NOW!&quot; Gabriel vented his frustration, slamming both hands on the office table, the guard scrambling to ring the parade bell. The bell gongs resounded across the barracks, making the nearby townsfolk and soldiers wonder what was even going on.</p><p>Yet the well-trained garrison members fell in quickly with their equipment and rifle all in place, while some of the lucky recruits who had been assigned to the city garrison rushed out sloppily, their gear still in a complete mess. Gabriel stepped up towards the platoons, addressing them directly. &quot;Guards of Desham, we have been tasked with a cleanup operation. Refugees have been illegally foraging from the Keru Forest, decimating the plants and trees in the region, harming what is rightfully of Desham! Our orders are to confiscate and have every food source that is not our rations!&quot;</p><p>No one talked, but the confusion in their eyes was clear. Gabriel could also sense a slight hesitation in a minority, many of them thinking the same way. &quot;Only a third of you will act first, while the others will be rotated on a shift basis. There is an incentive for you to carry out this mission. For every five you confiscate, you will get to keep one yourself.&quot;</p><p>Immediately the morale of the Guards were heightened immediately, their eyes brightened up even under the darkness of night. Many were unsatisfied with the food, while others were thinking about who they could give the food to in their family. Even the city dwellers were rationed as well, though not to the extent that the refugees were.</p><p>The operation began in earnest, the guards marching out of the gates into the slum-like maze of the refugee camps that had been expanding non-stop since months ago. Within minutes of the operation beginning, fights and scuffles started to break out, refugees trying to cling to their food and prevent it from being stolen. &quot;I had this bread since I left Ocra! It's not yours, and I didn't steal it from the Keru Forest!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's for your own safety - only the rations provided by Desham are medically sound. Look at the mold growing on the bread; it's what's giving you food poisoning!&quot; Some of the guards used the official excuse given, while the majority were more than happy to abuse their new position of power, beating and snatching any type of food from the refugees. A small minority of guards even snatched official rations, uncaring of the reason or rhyme for the operation.</p><p>Gabriel simply closed his eyes to the chaos unfolding as the first gunshot rang out, one of the guards having shot a refugee dead on the spot. <em>I’m doing this to protect my family. I’m doing this to protect my soldiers. If I lose my job, then it’s all over. </em>He kept repeating it to himself, trying to convince himself, yet the nature of the operation still didn’t sit right from him. It was only the consideration of what would happen to his wife and son that truly caused a dilemma – losing his job would mean losing the rations and reduced to a normal city dweller, or even worse, a refugee. </p><p>It was from there that the guards became even more bolder, having the superior firepower over the unarmed refugees. Vicorn himself and his Nest soldiers had entered the fray as well, taking advantage of the operation to steal anything of value, not just food alone. The Nest soldiers had expressions of joy and laughter as they tortured and wrung out everything worth something from the weakened refugees, not even sparing the sick or elderly. He watched as guards beat refugees into submission, the very innate nature of human violence coming out to the forefront as they fought over every scrap of food, confiscating them.</p><p>Blood was spilled on the street as some refugees tried to gather together, forming groups to resist the guards. However, even stacking bodies were not enough to face against the barrel of an arctech rifle that could end your life in a single pellet. As such, many refugees immediately gave up their food, and those who had nothing left to give were forced to relinquish their rations.</p><p>Carts upon carts of confiscated food were loaded up, escorted by squads of guards into the city, heading for the food storage areas where towering grain silos were filled to the brim. Some refugees tried to hide among the food in the carts, attempting to smuggle themselves only to be beaten badly, bruises coating their entire body before being hung up by their wrists over the gates as a warning to others.</p><p>&quot;Sir, permission to join the operation!&quot; The same lethargic guard who had been on the wall saluted him, eager to join the fray. Gabriel didn't give his tacit approval, only motioning with his hand for the guard to go ahead. The rest of the garrison that was still guarding the wall and jealous at the opportunity their fellow guards had rushed down with anticipation, eagerly ravaging through the refugee camp to search for food to confiscate as their own.</p><p>As the operation wore on, Gabriel had lost track of the number of carts that had been filled up to the brim. There wasn't any accurate census on the refugee camps, but he reckoned that it was about twenty thousand or so. <em>If all of them launched an attack together, it would take a miracle for my garrison of two hundred to even attempt to hold them back.</em> His paranoia had him ensure that there were enough soldiers back in the barracks, leaving two-thirds of the soldiers in reserve. &quot;Make sure we have our mounted repeaters ready to go as well as cannons. Just in case.&quot; Gabriel warned his sergeant beneath him.</p><p>The guards were rotated in shifts, the operation lasting through the night and earning panicked shouts and screams from the terrorized refugees. &quot;WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS! WE ARE VERSIANS TOO!&quot; A young man roared as he was pinned down to the ground, his chin scraping against the rocky dust ground that had long lost its color.</p><p>&quot;You're not a real Versian; you're just a leech!&quot; One of the guards sneered. &quot;You had every opportunity to sign up for the Army, yet you want all the benefits but none of the work.&quot; Just like this, a divide had been drawn between the guards of Desham and refugees, a hidden line in the sand that may never be repaired.</p><p>Gabriel had stayed up the whole night, his eyes slowly drooping asleep. As far as he could tell, the operation would be completed soon, so he decided to retire to his office and return to the military garrison. However, as soon as he could lean back into his chair, a sudden loud explosion rang out through the city, a booming creaking sound deafening through the still morning air that was followed by a thunderous crash. &quot;What?!&quot; He hurriedly grabbed his arctech radio, tuning the channel. &quot;This is Officer Gabriel, what's going on?&quot;</p><p>Only static could be heard across the various channels, and none of his messages got through in any way. &quot;Hello? Hello! Gate guards! What's the situation!&quot; Gabriel desperately fiddled with the dial to no avail. Having no other options, he stepped out of his office, heading to the parade square of the military barracks, only to see the arch of the city gates collapse entirely. Instead, all that was left was a crumbling pile of rubble in a V-shape form, refugees already clambering over to get into the city.</p><p>Other reserve guards were already awoken by the crash, astonished by the sudden attack that came out of nowhere. &quot;Get everyone out here NOW! This is not a drill!&quot; Gabriel urged the nearest sergeant, who was still rubbing his eyes sleepily, slapping his shoulder hard and jolting him awake.</p><p>They assembled an arctech wagon convoy, loading up weapons and mounting up arctech repeaters on the roof of the wagons, moving forward with portable barricades and other defenses as well. &quot;What happened to our guards out in the refugee camps?&quot; Gabriel asked a nearby sergeant hastily as he rode in the driver's cabin of the wagon.</p><p>&quot;The radio isn't getting through to them. I'm afraid that if the refugees are already coming into the city, they must have been lynched already!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No matter. We'll set up barricades on the main street to prevent the refugees from spreading further into the city. I want all the alleyways and side lanes blocked off too, no one gets past the main square!&quot;</p><p>While Gabriel's response was quick, the refugees were already emboldened by the collapse of the gate. Any city guard that had survived the collapse was brutally mauled to unrecognizable lumps of meat straddled among the rubbles, suffering countless knocks as refugees continued to pour into the city through the widening gap. Already they were gathering into a large crowd, marching down the main street and heading towards the large towering grain silos that were unmistakable in the Desham's skyline.</p><p>&quot;STOP RATIONING AND STEALING OUR FOOD! FREEDOM FOR VERSIANS!&quot; A galvanized refugee roared with all his might, the crowd chanting loudly in return. The operation had backfired, turning even the most apathetic refugee against the military of Desham who had stolen their food. Gabriel's men quickly set up a makeshift blockade on the main street, and some of the refugees were trying to sprint past before the barricade could be set up.</p><p>Gabriel himself had to wrestle a refugee who managed to squirm past the gaps, pinning him down onto the ground while another guard restrained him with handcuffs. A weird, familiar smell came from the refugee's breath, even as he struggled against the restraints. Gabriel grabbed the refugee's face with his hands, trying to recognize the smell. &quot;... meat? Mammoth hog meat? That's not possible, you can't hunt them regularly! Who gave you the meat?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck if I know! They were giving it out for free just two hours ago. Now let me fucking go! I'm Versian, too!&quot;</p><p><em>Someone is feeding them the meat. A mammoth hog isn't easy to take down, especially with the ragtag bunch of refugees.</em> Gabriel's heart plummeted, afraid to learn that maybe Vicorn was right about the entire incident. He returned to his senses quickly, ignoring the refugee's pleading and ordering his troops to fan out. &quot;Find out who's distributing the food and why! I want them caught and brought to me, now!&quot;</p><p>The soldiers filtered out through the narrow lanes and alleyways between congested buildings built haphazardly, arresting anyone that came into sight and steadily blocking off the paths. Soon, a strong, delicious smell of roasted mammoth hog meat began to surround them, the aroma enticing. Even the soldiers were salivating from the smell, but they did not dare go against their orders. They soon spotted the source of the smell, a lone human slow-cooking the meat over an open fire made of a random assortment of firewood. The sanitary conditions were abysmal, but none of the three dozen refugees queuing up for their cut had any complaints.</p><p>The moment a refugee got a skewer or a piece of the meat, he chomped it down quickly before running off to join the crowd of refugees that were now trying to force their way through Gabriel's first barricade. The flanking soldiers tried to stop the lone human selling the meat, but it only made the queuing refugees angrier, most of them lashing out at the soldiers and turning the alleyway into a close-quarters brawl. Weapons were anything the refugees could get their hands on, mostly chunks of scrap metal, broken branches, or fragmented tent poles with a sharpened fired tip.</p><p>Gabriel began to receive reports from the various squads, countless guards suffering injuries or dying due to the overwhelming numbers of refugees. &quot;Get every guard out here now, get them out here and hold the line! We can't let them further into Desham!&quot;</p><p>More and more guards poured out from the garrisons, bolstering the forces until they achieved parity with the rioting refugees who kept trying to climb over the barricades. Anyone who made it across found themselves immediately arrested and restrained, or beaten unconscious so as not to present a threat. The riot went on for a few minutes, but Gabriel felt like he had been there for hours on end.</p><p>While the brawls were erupting all throughout the various alleyways, Gabriel felt that something was off, even as he visually saw someone distributing the meat to the burgeoning crowd of refugees. <em>Are they feeding the refugees so they riot for them? If so... then these refugees must be a distraction. What is their end goal?</em></p><p>Realization dawned onto Gabriel, his head swivelling to quickly do a count of the soldiers. &quot;How many guards are left back at the garrison?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, I think there's only a dozen of them left. You asked for all of them to come out.&quot; The sergeant replied confusedly.</p><p>&quot;We need to go back now. Take three squads and return before -&quot;</p><p>Gabriel couldn't finish his sentence, not when he spotted a glint of metal fired from the walls of Desham, slamming into the armory of the garrison. Instantly, a loud, dazzling ball of flame erupted into the sky, the brightness of the explosion forcing him to shield his eyes. The resulting air shockwave rippled through the town of Desham as the ammunition and explosives within the armory all ignited as well, blowing up into a rapidly expanding pillar of smoke. Tainted glass windows of buildings, stores, and factories were shattered easily by the air shockwave, while weaker buildings began to collapse from the resulting tremors, unable to hold up their own weights with their crumbling and poorly maintained foundations.</p><p>He could feel the dull thud in his eardrums deafening him and his men, as well as the astonished refugees, all of whom cowered under the rushing air. As soon as he took another look at the garrison, the entire barracks and armory had been carved in half, the buildings and fortifications decimated by the immense explosion and sheer force.</p><p>None of the refugees chanted any longer nor tried to push, merely staring in surprise and shock at what had just happened. However, Gabriel knew exactly what had just happened. <em>They sabotaged us!</em></p><p>Suddenly, a call rang out from deep within the crowd of refugees. &quot;FORWARD! THEY HAVE NO MORE AMMUNITION! THE GARRISON HAS BEEN DESTROY! FOR FREEDOM!!!&quot;</p><p>The galvanizing, invigorating call rang out sharp and clear, reminding the refugees what was happening now as the crowd began to push once more against the barricade, their efforts even more concerted than ever. The barricades threatened to topple over from the impact, forcing the guards to use their bodies to prop them up and resist the refugees' push. Morale among the soldiers had plummeted to an all-time low, and many of them were already thinking of ways to get out of this mess. With the barracks destroyed, Gabriel had now lost almost all hope of controlling the local populace, their authority marred by the inability to defend their own barracks.</p><p>&quot;Sir, your orders! We can't hold this line any longer, we're going to be overrun! Sir? Sir!&quot; A sergeant shouted at Gabriel desperately, who was still stunned in a stupor.</p><p>Gabriel's eyes turned towards the refugees, watching the countless faces shout and roar at him, wanting to tear apart Desham limb from limb. He could already imagine the bloodthirsty refugees seeking revenge on every city dweller in Desham. The faces of his wife and his son came into his mind as well, Gabriel knowing that if he did not stop them, his family may be in peril as well. <em>I started this mess, but a simple apology wouldn't cut it either. My wife and son is counting on me!</em></p><p>He wanted to curse the Governor, but he was the one who carried the operation out in the end. All he could think of was his son's beaming face back at his simple house, shining brightly in his memories. If he let the refugees anywhere near his family, they would no doubt rip them to shreds. That was how the Versian revolution went in the first place, steeling his own heart.</p><p>&quot;Mount the repeaters and wait for my signal,&quot; Gabriel ordered suddenly, snapping out of his stupor.</p><p>The desperate sergeant stared in shock, before blurting out. &quot;Sir, you can't be serious! These are Versians, refugees or not! Such a command would-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you wish to be hanged, quartered, and flayed by them? Have you not seen the images and paintings of the original revolutionaries? Your family is waiting behind you, and we have no other recourse. Do you want to see them executed?!&quot;</p><p>The sergeant’s words were stuck in his throat, gulping. Every guard here knew they would be immediately overrun by the rioting refugees and beaten to death if nothing changed. After all, that was what they had seen the original revolutionaries do to the nobility’s soldiers during the first revolution. It was part and parcel of a riot.</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“N-no, sir.”</p><p>“THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? I SAID: MOUNT ALL OF THEM!” Gabriel shouted for the first time in a long time, his desire to defend his family mounting to an all-time high.</p><p>The guards quickly hefted the large machine guns on the top of the driver cabin of each wagon, hooking up an arcite fuel pipe connected to the wagon tank. The guards who handled the machine gun and aimed down the barrel at the ravenous crowd were trembling, afraid of what would happen if they pulled the trigger. However, they were equally afraid of what would happen to them if they did not pull the trigger.”</p><p>“OPEN FIRE!”</p><p><strong>Chapter 124 - Path of Blood</strong></p><p>The mounted arctech repeaters fired rapidly, the engraving along the barrels glowing intensely as the storm of pellets showered the rioting crowd. Each pellet drove a straight hole through the sickly flesh of the malnourished slum dwellers, ripping through muscles, tendons and skin in a churn of blood and meat.</p><p>Chants from the crowd turned to screams of horror as the rioting crowd immediately dispersed, but it was far too late for many of them. Many slum dwellers could only watch in shock as they ran, witnessing the zipping pellets turn their childhood friends into a ragdoll, the multitude of pellets drilling and lodging themselves into the bones.</p><p>The mounted arctech repeaters' fire stopped in ten seconds as the barrel began to overheat, but the carnage had already been wrought. Hundreds of bodies were now piled up on one another, with survivors desperately trying to claw their way out of the pile. Others were suffocating under the immense weight, unable to move as their last vision was only a glimmer of the bright sky, their vision murked by the streams of blood that flowed freely from the top.</p><p>Some stumbled away, unaware of their own impending death as they tried to plug the holes from which chunks of organs began to seep out. One man carried his wife in his arms, trying to flee while dragging his shot left leg, limping. “We’re almost out, we’re almost out!” he whispered to himself, unaware that his back was already riddled with pellet holes while his wife’s head lay limp, a gaping hole on her forehead with her eyes locked in a shocked expression.</p><p>The sight burned itself into the minds of the guards, with many of the local garrison’s guards having only heard about the first war but not fighting in it. Some of them retched out their meals on the sidewalk, while others began to tremble violently, unable to cope with the horrors in front of them.</p><p>“Arrest them all. Shoot all who resist.” Officer Gabriel ordered, but none of the guards moved. Not even the sergeant dared to move.</p><p>“Sergeant, execute the order NOW! Or should I consider this as insubordination?!”</p><p>The sergeant quickly snapped out of his hesitation; the years of blindly following orders from above drilled into him. “Arrest them now! Move!”</p><p>A good chunk of the guards complied, moving on instinct as they stepped over the barrier, their boots squishing against the strewn corpses that hugged the street, fresh blood streaming. However, there were three guards who refused to move, instead aiming their arctech guns towards Gabriel. &quot;This is slaughter! I didn't sign up for the Army just so I can steal from them and kill them! Retract the order or I'll have to kill you!&quot; One of them threatened, motioning with the barrel of his arctech rifle.</p><p>Without hesitation, Gabriel immediately pulled out his handgun, executing all three of them in a swift motion. “Insubordination is punishable by death.” He muttered to convince himself, holstering his smoking handgun back into its holder. &quot;I want this city under control, no matter want. MOVE! Get three squads back to the garrison barracks and find out who bombed us! Desham is now under martial law!&quot;</p><p>The guards surged forward, desperate to retain their authority over the refugees. Anyone who tried to stand up against was shot on sight, leaving the streets of Desham riddled with bodies and blood unlike never before. Brutality and violence had become the norm for the next few hours, as refugees scampered to get out of the city, unwilling to lose their lives to the guards. The sweep did not end there, with the guards pouring out into the refugee camp, sweeping through and executing those who resisted. Some of the guards had been originally reluctant: confiscating food was one thing, but slaughtering the helpless refugees was another. However, Officer Gabriel's execution of those who defied him was more than enough to persuade them otherwise.</p><p>&quot;The people do not respect us - the refugees, the city dwellers, even the councilors!&quot; Officer Gabriel roared as he led the sweep himself. &quot;They treat us lower than dogs, lower than even the ants that crawl on the pavement. We upheld justice and the law in this town, yet all we got was virtol and calls for our blood. They escalated it first! We gave them rations, we offered them recruitment, and in exchange they desecrate the very city we swore to protect. THEY ARE THE ATTACKERS!&quot;</p><p>The false sense of justice emboldened the guards, spurred on by peer pressure as well as the fear of retribution if they ever let the refugees regroup or form back into a large crowd again. Their minds had been spurred to put the blame of the unrest on the refugees, but Officer Gabriel knew exactly who was really to blame. <em>The Governor.</em> The poor management and greed had led to tough conditions which gave rise to more unrest and rebellious elements among the refugees. However, there was no turning back now.</p><p>Conflict was like a ladder of escalating violence; it was a simple matter of who was willing to climb to the higher rung to assert victory and dominance. <em>The refugees were the ones who escalated the issue first!</em> Gabriel tried to convince himself, but as the counterattack progressed deeper into the slums, the guards were frightened by the sights they saw.</p><p>Countless guards and Nest men who had been part of the confiscation operation were mutilated, cut, and hung up all along the streets, stripped of their clothes, armor, and weapons in their entirety. Many were still alive, barely clinging onto consciousness as wounds and blood still flowed freely, dripping off their dangling toes. Vicorn had not been spared either, suffering bruises and slashes all across his lanky wrinkled body, his old sagging skin marred with stains of blood as he murmured incoherently.</p><p>&quot;Get those men medical attention now! What's the status of the garrison barracks? Do we have access to our medical supplies?&quot; Gabriel hurriedly organized a rescue effort, the guards moving forward to cut off their fellow colleagues' restraints as fast as they could. The rescue bogged down the original arresting operation - Gabriel still saw his men as a useful resource necessary to maintain the martial law. At least a third of his men and all Nest guards in the city had been beaten badly.</p><p>Gabriel knelt next to the suffering Vicorn, checking the condition of his tortured body. &quot;Who did this, Vicorn? Did you get lynched by the refugees?!&quot;</p><p>Vicorn finally noticed Gabriel's face, his eyes widening as his gnarly old hands clutched Gabirel's sleeves. &quot;The Ghosts! The Ghosts, we were attacked by Ghosts!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ghosts...? That's not possible. Official military information was that the Ghosts all died in the depths of Tenar, there shouldn't be any left.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Ghosts! The Ghosts!&quot; Vicorn blabbered incoherently, the panic in his face visible but his words were jumbled up in a never-ending loop. Gabriel couldn't waste any more time on the clearly mentally deranged Vicorn now, moving off to assist his men in retrieving the other injured guards.</p><p>Still, Vicorn's words lingered in Gabriel's mind. <em>The Ghosts... if it is really them, that explains everything. But now that they have blown up the garrison barracks... what is their next goa-</em> Gabriel immediately turned about, marching straight back towards a wagon positioned near the pile of rubble that was once the city gates and rasping on the door. &quot;The council hall, who's guarding the council hall?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, we have two squads guarding the councilors and the Governor. We're still being jammed, so we can't reach them!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get me to the council hall now! You two, get your squads and follow me!&quot; Gabriel urged, rushing over to the council hall. However, it was already too late. The two squads that had been defending the council halls had been shot dead, their bodies littered across the entrance while the once grand doors had been blown open completely. As soon as Officer Gabriel arrived at the front steps, there were already a dozen Ghosts aiming their Aspis MK2 repeaters at the wagons, while Kyle and Diya had captured the Governor already.</p><p>&quot;Stand down, Officer Gabriel, stand down!&quot; The Governor urged his eyes continuously glancing to the side of his head, where Kyle had his Oriental Bloom handgun pressed against the Governor's temple. &quot;I SAID STAND DOWN!&quot;</p><p>Officer Gabriel cursed under his breath, wondering whether he should start a fight. However, he soon noticed that Kyle and the Ghosts were all well armored, featuring arctech knight armor that could deflect most pellets, while his own guards were relatively poorly equipped. He motioned with his hand, ordering the guards not to fire. Beyond the blasted door of the council hall, Gabriel could see the dead bodies of the councilors who had stayed behind, all of them killed by the Ghosts.</p><p>&quot;Smart head on your shoulders, Governor. Life is important after all, is it not? Now, let's continue our discussion of how we can collaborate.&quot; Kyle spoke with a confident aura, his suave voice precise and clear for all to here. &quot;Perhaps we can start by reigning in these guards. Have them disarm their weapons. Now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-there's no need to, we can work together, like you've said. I can give you one-tenth, no, one-fifth of all the food stored in the silo. You'll be provided with lodging in Desham, and you'll have a seat on the council.&quot; The Governor pleaded. &quot;The guards will be useful in enforcing rule and stability, and together we can crush the refugees to our will!&quot; He continued to talk, while his shifty eyes motioned at Gabriel with a slight hint, Gabriel getting the gist of what's happening. Gabriel himself used three fingers behind his back, acting like he was stretching his finger though he instead was signaling to a guard still in the wagon. The wagon guard nodded in response, preparing an emergency smoke gun that would signal all the guards to converge on the council hall. <em>The Governor is trying to buy time for us!</em></p><p>&quot;And why would I want to crush the refugees to our will?&quot; Kyle asked.</p><p>&quot;W-what? Isn't that the whole purpose of all of this? So that you can get power? I can help you, my family and friends are all bigshots in the city, and we can-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think there's a misunderstanding, Governor. I'm not interested in sharing power.&quot; Kyle grinned, the Oriental Bloom handgun powering up. &quot;I'm here to send a message. And I don't need a middleman.&quot;</p><p>Gabriel's jaw dropped as he watched the handgun's fired pellet blast the Governor's brains out, grey matter forcing through a tiny hole through the skull while the Governor's body collapsed to the ground, his face still locked in confusion. Before Gabriel could even give the command to fire, the Ghosts attacked first, their amplified Aspis MK2 Repeaters mowing down the guards who couldn't react fast enough.</p><p>The arctech wagons were riddled with holes, killing even the guard who was about to fire the smoke gun. Gabriel dived to the ground behind the wagon, trying to scramble away from the withering barrage that decimated all the guards around him, leaving him as the sole survivor. He cowered down, covering his head before he heard a loud stomp land right next to him, Kyle grabbing him by the collar and slamming him into the ground again, Gabriel's bone hurting from the forceful impact.</p><p>&quot;You've acted just like Diya said you would. Now, tell all your guards to stand down, or your wife and son will be killed right now. Don't make this any harder than it has to be.&quot; Kyle lifted him up again, strangling him with a single armored fist on his right exosuit arm.</p><p>Gabriel grunted as he struggled to pry open Kyle's fingers wrapped around his neck to no avail, his legs kicking futilely at the immobile Kyle. <em>It's him! He's the one behind all of this!</em> Despair took over Gabriel's mind, his will eventually breaking as he nodded vigorously in agreement, before Kyle released him to the floor.</p><p>&quot;Get to it. I don't have much time. Get all the guards to assemble in front of me right now.&quot;</p><p>Just like this, Desham's entire authority fell under the Ghosts. Gabriel's command to retreat was met with confusion, but the majority decided to follow, assembling in front of the council hall where the Ghosts disarmed them, reliefing them of their arctech rifles and weapons entirely. Close to a hundred guards were now standing in front of Kyle and Diya, who now wielded the power in Desham. &quot;Good work. The city is now ours.&quot; Kyle smiled, the plan having been pulled off successfully.</p><p>With the meat accumulated from the Keru Forest, they were able to coordinate and galavnize the refugees to surge forward. He had allowed Nest to see and get information on their supply route, raising the alarm and undoubtedly getting the military to suppress the refugees, creating even more unrest that Kyle could direct. Jammers and explosives were placed accordingly, while the enhanced Hayden projectile by the railgun allowed Kyle to blow up the garrison barracks from a good range. Diya too was amazed at the ease of the plan, though she still had a few lingering questions. &quot;Sir, wouldn't it have been easier if they were in the barracks and sleeping? Your railgun would have killed all of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I believe in human rights.&quot; Kyle spoke cryptically. &quot;Every human's life has meaning, and it wouldn't be right to just kill them like that.&quot;</p><p>Diya and the Ghosts were slightly surprised by the statement. &quot;Okay, but these guards would find every opportunity to betray us the moment Harrison turns his sight onto us. They are a liability, we should not even be trying to recruit them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that why you think I gathered all of the guards here?&quot; Kyle smirked. &quot;Like I said, every human's life has meaning.&quot;</p><p>Diya was about to ask again, but a rumbling sound could be heard from afar, a wave of thunderous footsteps approaching. The refugees who was on the run from the pursuing guards now had the complete freedom to enter the city, all of them marching and pushing up in unison. Their march led them right up to the council hall, where the guards were all lined up in unison, their faces still confused as to what was about to happen. Chants by the refugees could be heard again, blood boiling and tension rising.</p><p>&quot;DOWN WITH THE MILITARY! DOWN WITH THE GOVERNOR!&quot;</p><p>&quot;KILL THEM ALL! KILL THEM ALL AND TAKE OUR FREEDOM!&quot;</p><p>&quot;There he is, that's the fucking governor who.... huh? He's dead!&quot; One of the refugees leading the mob spotted the dead Governor's body, lifeless on the street like a wretched dog who had just been put down. The eyes of the refugees rested on Kyle, his figure imposing as he mercilessly kicked the governor's body.</p><p>&quot;Who's that? Who's the man who killed the governor?&quot; The refugees had no clue who Kyle was, Kyle having kept hidden throughout this entire affair, working from the shadows.</p><p>Some of the more enraged refugees blinded by anger didn't care who it was. &quot;Must be another fucking prick! Look at his outfit, he's not a refugee! Kill him before he kills us!&quot;</p><p><em>Intimidation Aura!</em></p><p>&quot;CITIZENS OF VERSIA!&quot; Kyle bellowed with such force that all the refugees stopped right in their tracks, the fearsome aura spreading through them quickly and rooting their feet to the ground. When the refugees looked at him, they didn't just see a normal man - they saw the embodiment of dominance and fear, their primal instincts immediately raising alarm bells against Kyle, warning themselves not to fight him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kyle didn't continue speaking, instead motioning for Diya to step forward and address the rowdy mob. Diya gulped instinctively. She knew that this had always been part of the plan, yet now that she stood in front of thousand of hungry faces ready to tear her apart the moment she made a mistake, fear began to creep into her heart.</p><p>An awkward silence passed as Diya took deep breaths, the refugees still held at bay by Kyle, Kyle looking at Diya and observing her actions. Before Kyle decided to relinquish her of her role, Diya took a bold step forward, placing her right in front of the refugees.</p><p>&quot;I have killed the Governor!&quot; Diya loudly declared, her determined voice carrying far and wide. &quot;I have killed the Governor, not because I seek power. Not because I seek wealth, and not because I seek control over others like you! No, I killed the Governor, because I am you!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am a refugee of the war, forced out of my home, forced into the camps to languish into famine, to suffer sickness and thirst, to be pushed into decisions that our forefathers, our Versian ancestors before could have never tolerate. Decades ago, we united against the tyranny of the Yual Dominion, waging countless revolutions! My father and grandfather before me have fought tooth and nail for a better future! Is this the better future that they had hoped for? NO, IT IS NOT!&quot;</p><p>The refugees faces began to lit up, murmurs of agreement through the crowd as they listened to Diya. &quot;We fought for freedom, for equality, for representation of all Versians, yet look what happened? Greed and misery are accepted as the normal conditions, the voices of the poor and the forsaken lost in the midst of war, politics and the interest of the minority that seek to rule us? Did we not oust the nobility from their seats of power? Did we not swore to stamp out the evils of royalty and everything the Yual Dominion stood for? I am like you, my comrades. I want food to eat, I want water to drink, I want a place to stay! I want safety, I want freedom, I want my voice to be heard! But most of all, I want this for ALL VERSIANS! WHAT SAY YOU?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;FREEDOM FOR ALL VERSIANS!&quot; A refugee called out, the rest of the refugees chanting along.</p><p>&quot;I am not here to be your leader, but to be your friend, to be your hope! Together we shall build a greater Desham inclusive of all, a greater future that we and our children can be proud of! I have killed the Governor, because I am you, and you are me! With our hearts and mind combined, food, water and housing are basic rights to be made available to all! No more greed, no more corruption, no more unnecessary suffering. And anyone who tries to take that away from us will see a force and fury greater than this, so great that we can topple an entire city like we did today. FOLLOW US! JOIN THE GHOSTS OF VERSIA AND FOLLOW ME, DIYA, INTO THE FUTURE, AND LET US BUILD DESHAM TOGETHER, BETTER!&quot;</p><p>&quot;YEAAH!&quot; The refugees all pumped their fists into the air.</p><p>&quot;And as for the guards who have tried to steal from us, who have slaughtered countless of our brethen, they are not fit to join this future of us! We have stripped them of their weapons - deal with them as you see fit!&quot; Diya waved her hand towards Officer Gabriel who's face paled at the implications of what was to happen.</p><p>Kyle ended his intimidation aura, the refugees seeing the change in atmosphere as a sign that bravery had built up in them once more. All of their pent-up anger and hate was unleashed onto the guards, a big scuffle breaking out while the Ghosts and Kyle did nothing to stem the virulent violence that was spreading. Officer Gabriel himself fought as hard as he could to get away from the mob, but the refugees were far too numerous, chasing him down through the street and pouncing on him, countless punches and kicks raining blows upon blows on him.</p><p>&quot;The guards are the perfect outlet for the refugees to vent their frustration. This will solidify our legitimacy even better. Get the Ghosts to open the grain storage, distribute the food immediately with no restrictions among the refugees.&quot; Kyle explained to Diya as they re-entered the council hall, the bodies of the dead councilors still littered across the marble floor, blood flowing freely. &quot;Begin recruitment immediately - we'll take over every infrastructure that is still functioning.&quot;</p><p>Diya assumed her role as the new installed leader of Desham, the two dozen veteran Ghosts and numerous fresh recruits executing her orders to the letter. The grain storage that had once been the prized possession of the now deceased Governor was pillaged by the refugees, the stores of food now open for all to eat. Still, the refugees were not allowed to gorge themselves on the food, lest they suffer from overeating. Deployed Ghosts still controlled the rate at which they were allowed to access food, though the refugees were still more than happy to receive their due shares.</p><p>&quot;Girl, quick, queue up so we get more food!&quot; A malnourished mother hurried her daughter along, her spindly arms a testament to the famine she had suffered through. Countless refugees had similar stories like this, all of them now allowed to roam the city freely. Workers joined them in arms, rising up against their employers in force and immediately fighting back, gunshots ringing out among the streets.</p><p>On the other hand, the city dwellers who had been living in Desham were appalled by the sudden influx of refugees. They barricaded themselves into their own houses, hoping to wait out the storm on their own stockpiles that they had been accumulating over the last two months. Diya didn't falter at all, immediately ordering the Ghosts to arm the refugees and break into the houses. A revolution had now begun, sweeping the entire city of Desham from top to bottom, leaving no stone unturned.</p><p>Some Versian guards survived, trying to escape through secret tunnels or hiding in basements, hoping to contact the military generals in Ocra or Tenar for assistance. &quot;We must inform them that Desham has fallen to the Ghosts!&quot; However, there were far too many refugees spreading out towards the city, hungry for revenge on those who had stolen from them. Every city dweller and guard was painted as the enemy, the refugees forming hunting squads and chasing stragglers down.</p><p>Their furniture, paintings, possessions and wealth were all appropriated by the refugees, houses now occupied by the unruly refugees while those who refused to give up their property were beaten and arrested, dragged to the council hall for a false trial. &quot;We shall hold a feast, a feast to mark this day as the day of renewal for a free Versia!&quot; Diya proclaimed, using the same banquet hall that the Governor and his cronies had been partying just the night before.</p><p>Countless residents tried their luck to merge into the refugees, but many were recognized and spotted immediately. &quot;You, you're the factory owner who enslaved my brother!&quot; One of the refugees yelled and pointed at a scrawny old man, his belly hard to hide despite his attempts to disguise himself. He was immediately arrested and hauled up for trial, Diya herself presiding over the ruckus as other refugees gathered in the banquet hall, shouting and screaming murder at the accused city dwellers while they munched on meat and drank the wine cellar of the Governor.</p><p>&quot;Bring out the first to be accused!&quot; Diya motioned, a lady and her son being dragged out in chains while the crowding refugees yelled and tossed food at them. &quot;The wife of Officer Gabriel, who had given the order to slaughter countless Versians in cold blood, using the same guards and weapons sworn to protect Desham and fellow Versians! What do you have to say in your defense?!&quot;</p><p>The wife of Gabriel couldn't speak at all, her legs shivering violently as she began to break into tears, watching the lifeless body of Gabriel being tossed in front of her, his face beaten into an unrecognizable pulp. The son was equally terrified, even if he did not truly understand what was going on.</p><p>&quot;It seems the accused has no defense! As such, I pass my judgement - to be hung right now as a lesson to all those who would go against the cause!&quot; Diya ordered, two Ghosts immediately hauling the wife and son away. The trials gave the refugees the vengeance they sought, giving them a cathartic release from all of the suffering and painful memories they endured during their time in the camps.</p><p>Not all of the upper-class or the garrison were captured just yet, many survivors clambering into secret tunnels built long ago that led out of the city, used in times of sieges. A sergeant led his his half-bruised men rescued from the clutches of the refugees down into the basement of a building. “Brothers, we will escape and find help, as soon as the Versian Army knows about this, retaliation will be swif- what the hell?!” </p><p>His inspirational speech was blocked by the ridiculous sight of a few of the former Governor’s sycophants already there, though they were moving extremely slowly due to the sheer amount of belongings that were being ferried by the servants down the tunnel. </p><p>“What the fuck is this?” One of the sergeants remarked as he noticed a servant of the council member carrying an opulent blue velvet carpet, attempting to stuff it through with his body in a small tight tunnel. “This tunnel is meant for escape, not for all your stupid, worthless belongings!”</p><p>“Shut up! That carpet is worth more than your entire platoon.” A council member rebuked the soldiers, causing them to be even angrier at what was happening. <em>Officer Gabriel sacrificed himself for this cunts?!</em></p><p>A knowing look was exchanged between the soldiers, prompting them to grab the council member by the limbs. The servants immediately brandished their knives but were stalled by the soldiers, who all held arctech repeaters. “Do you really want to sacrifice yourself for this shithole of a master? Huh?”</p><p>“Let me go this instant! This is treason!” The council member struggled against the restraints. “If you just wait half an hour, the tunnel will be free to use!”</p><p>“Like hell, I’m going to wait!” The sergeant executed the council member on the spot with a gunshot right to the head. “Clear out the damn fucking tunnel!”</p><p>The soldiers fired shots into the tunnel, causing the servants who were still ferrying goods within to scream and speed up their pace, clearing out the length of the tunnel. “Good, let’s go. If we can get out of Desham and get the message out to the military, we can exact revenge for Officer Gabriel!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>But just as they began to enter the tunnel one by one, a loud scream could be heard at the front, along with what sounded like the slashing of flesh. The servants began to cry out in horror one by one, dropping the items they were carrying and running back, trying to squeeze past the soldiers. </p><p>“They found the tunnel, they found us!” The servants screamed in panic as a squad of Ghosts flushed them out, dragging the entire tunnel down into a fierce firefight as many of the Versian soldiers were caught off-guard, shot before they knew what was happening. Some tried to escape back the way they came, only to find angry refugees already flanking them, cutting off their retreat and capturing them in droves. </p><p>Other surviving soldiers broke up into various groups as they scattered across the city, trying to find a place to entrench themselves into. The smarter ones targeted restaurants with ample food storage, while the more desperate ones tried to break into the houses of the known upper class, believing that they could use the luxuries to barter for food. Instead, all of them found armed refugees already occupying most of the places, resulting in fights breaking out all over Desham. Hours went by before the Ghosts managed to spread out and captured all of the remaining stragglers.</p><p>Within a single day, more than three thousand were marked to be hanged. Factory owners, store owners, landlords, escaping guards, former councilors - the purge was unrelenting. Kyle did not let a single one of the upper-class slip through his finger, ensuring that no one would ever think about going against the Ghosts again in Desham. With the military and the upper-class now crippled, Desham was ruled by the masses.</p><p>Recruitment of the refugees into Ghosts went smoothly as well, the Ghosts having earned a legendary reputation for achieving and leading the revolution. Many saw the Ghosts as a way into the new power structure that rule Desham, while others truly believed in the cause of the Ghosts, wanting to fight for a free Versia. It did not matter to Kyle their differences - as long as they were all aligned towards the same goal of opposing the current power structure of Versia.</p><p>Controlling Desham was merely one step of the plan. &quot;We will need to rebuild and industrialize. Food from the Keru Forest by hunting mammoth hogs is not sustainable in the long run. If we are to establish a serious base of operations, mobilizing the refugees is of critical operations.&quot; Kyle explained the course of action to Diya and the other Ghosts as they gathered in the former Governor's office, looking over the finances of Desham. &quot;The first order of business is to hunt down and ensure no one can report what happened here to Harrison. Capture every Nest soldier and worker in Tenar Logging, and make sure we're providing false reports to stave off any suspicion. Establish communication back with Ocra so we can see the progress of the war as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about the refugees? How do we get them to move? Most of them might not want to work.&quot; Diya pointed out.</p><p>&quot;The refugees did not want to join the Army nor did they want to join the factories because they did not want to be a cog in the machine. But if they knew what they were working for, and what it would help them with, they would do it without any complaints. We will also ostracize and reduce rations for those unwilling to help out with the rebuilding of Desham. Feldon and I will head two construction companies, building them from the ground up. We will use the wood from Tenar Logging to establish quick and easy permanent housing.&quot; Kyle drew up a simple blueprint, a standard house that was rugged and resilient enough to withstand the elements.</p><p>&quot;The refugees wouldn't know how to build a house - hell, I wouldn't know how to myself!&quot; A Ghost pointed out.</p><p>&quot;That's why we would be performing it in a pre-fabricated manner. Each refugee would be only given a single specific task, rather than trying to make them an expert in everything. I will oversee the entire process and ensure each role is filled accurately.&quot; Kyle cut up the blueprint with lines, highlighting them to be different sections manufactured in advance. Construction equipment was also not an issue, the factory workers having already ousted the factory owners from power and taking control on themselves.</p><p>Not everyone was planning to listen to Diya and Kyle; many of the more opportunistic refugees had occupied houses and districts using captured military equipment to put up resistance and carve out their own territory much like Raktor. Kyle did not stand for any of this, personally sending Sasha and the other Ghosts crush each gang and thug outfit that appeared with brutal forces, their mutilated bodies laid bare for all the other refugees to see and quelling all thoughts of resisting the new order. </p><p>Over the next week, Kyle solidified his grip over Desham, having Diya act as the figurehead while he held all the power in the shadows, controlling the strings that led to the restoration of Desham. The refugees had nothing to complain about; the stored food and the hunted mammoth hog meat ensured they did not go hungry. The housing plan was met with thunderous support among the compliant refugees and workers overall, each of them feeling a sense of fulfillment towards a common goal, much unlike how they were working beforehand for the profits of the minority.</p><p>The progress was visible, Sasha leading a strike force to establish control over Tenar Logging and their restricted forestry zones. With the military garrison in the city destroyed, the Nest guards capitulated easily, surrendering to the Ghosts and allowing Kyle to take over command of the forestry operations. Every logging equipment fell easily into his hands and setting the stage for an entire vertical industry to take place.</p><p>Kyle worked with the emboldened factory workers, finding skilled arctech engineers and etchers among them to work out the fabrication of the houses. Other unskilled workers were used to dig out sewage systems beyond the walls of Desham, expanding the infrastructure and laying roads for better transportation of materials. They worked round the clock in shifts, everyone enjoying the fruits of the revolution and invigorated by the recent victory.</p><p>Each tile and wooden beam they laid as the foundations spurred them, even more, to work harder, seeing their work contribute to a goal that directly benefited them. Naturally, not everyone was aligned with the same goals. Some tried to steal and scavenge materials, stashing them and hoping to sell them secretly to others, things like arcite ore, engines, or even wagons. Such corruption or black market dealing was crushed instantly by the Ghosts wherever found, the perpetrators tortured heavily and forced into slave labor, their crimes known to the rest.</p><p>With the beneficial projects being done, along with the bad apples being weeded out, a strong labor base of refugees and factory workers began to coalesce into the new manpower pool that was loyal to the Ghosts and Diya, believing in the future that Diya had preached. It was hard to argue otherwise, when already the foundations of houses and their internal frames were being established in droves, the former slum maze of the refugee camps being removed in favor of much more stable housing.</p><p>By the end of two weeks, the first houses were completed, and the hardworking construction workers and refugees were allocated first and allowed their families to have a safe shelter. Their tangible rewards further entrenched their respect and adoration for the Ghosts, the reputation of the Ghosts of Versia skyrocketing when pinned against the terrible actions and deeds of the Governor and his cronies.</p><p>The Keru Forest village had also been transformed into a hunting base, a productive process of hunting and foraging being established by the influx of more manpower being sent from Desham. Drake's potion production process was also improved with more helpers, the village expanding in prosperity while enjoying all of the benefits and comforts of Desham, receiving household necessities and luxuries appropriated from the purged upper-class.</p><p>The city gate had also been restored, Kyle reinforcing it. Throughout these two weeks, refugees had continuously been streaming in, but in the last two days, the number of refugees had dropped considerably, Kyle worrying a little about the implications of such an effect. What made it even more concerning was that the rate of injured soldiers fleeing the battlefield had increased dramatically, composing more than a third of the refugees coming. Information about the war and battles was sparse and uncoordinated as best, each of the injured guards having their own takes on what happened.</p><p>&quot;We lost many comrades, but our forces overall have gained an upper hand over those damn Yual dogs!&quot; One of the injured soldiers waved his fist angrily as he was interrogated by the Ghosts, while others moaned. </p><p>A few suffered strange symptoms of frostbite, their eyes wide from the horrors they had seen as they clutched onto the edges of their bed, unwilling to leave it. “The ice… the ice! Don’t bring me back there, don’t bring me back! Not the ice!” </p><p>Kyle couldn’t make sense of the crazy ramblings, but the progress of the war was of critical importance to Kyle, so he continued the interrogations. Ghost messengers made runs and hitched messages on supply wagons bound for Ocra, forming a communication network that allowed for transfer of information.</p><p>By now, Harrison would have already been fighting for three weeks in total, yet the most recent message from Culo was that the battle was still being reported as a slow Versian victory. Despite the power and technological prowess of Harrison, the sheer army size of Count Leon was not easy to defeat in its entirety, the tides of war going back and forth as the soldiers fought over every inch of land.</p><p>Kyle pondered on what he needed to do - the longer the war goes on, the more power he would gain in both Raktor and here in Desham. If he wanted to prolong the war, he needed to assist the side that was losing. <em>This means at some point, I will have to either help Harrison or Count Leon.</em></p><p>By now, he had regained his former strength of two hundred Ghosts, forming a strong enough force to perform strikes in the war as well. <em>Moving from Desham would leave this new industrial base vulnerable to a counterattack by Harrison, but if I don't assist Count Leon, Raktor could fall under siege, and it would jeopardize my factories under the Seven Snakes.</em> Kyle preferred not to suffer any losses to what he had painstakingly established in Raktor as well, about to assemble a strike team under Sasha to return to Raktor when a new military report on the progress of the war had been intercepted by the Ghosts reached his ears.</p><p>&quot;The Versian Army has been routed at the border, and they are retreating to Ocra! Count Leon and the forces of Kregol and Perlis are now on the offensive!&quot;</p><p><em>The first strike has failed?!</em> Kyle was surprised that Harrison would make such a blunder, but it didn't matter. With the Versian Army on the route, he had no doubt that Count Leon is angling for a quick end to the war, something Kyle could not allow to happen.</p><p>&quot;Prepare the Ghosts. We will have to fight for Ocra in a month.&quot;</p><p>@@@@@@</p><p><em>A day later, in Ocra...</em></p><p>The refugee camp at Ocra was in shambles, with countless injured and defeated soldiers streaming through its streets as they fled the battlefield, seeking refuge in Ocra. They were a sorry bunch, their uniforms in tatters while their eyes stared into the horizon. The bravery and courage they once held before the war were now replaced with a daze and an aversion to loud sounds. They marched silently without cheer, huddled together under the light drizzle over Ocra, their boots smacking the soggy mud in a depressing retreat.</p><p>Refugees and slum dwellers alike who did not have the means nor courage to flee to other cities could only watch on as the column of defeated soldiers entered into misery, the despair and impending failure crippling the morale of the city. Amidst the column of soldiers were captured Raktor soldiers, kept in metal cages that were hauled into the city, the generals had hoped that such shows of imprisonment would help uplift the spirits.</p><p>Instead, the Raktor soldier merely grinned at the forlorn sights of the citizens and residents of Ocra who looked on from their windows and along the streets, his body bloodied and soaked in mud. With a crazed voice, he shouted out with a harrowing tone: &quot;FOOLS! SOON, DEATH WILL COME FOR ALL OF YOU! COUNT LEON AND HIS KNIGHTS WILL SLAUGHTER ALL OF YOU AND TEAR YOU LIMB FROM LIMB! IN THREE DAYS, ALL OF YOU WILL-&quot;</p><p>His furious speech was cut short by the stab of a spear, a Versian soldier killing him out of fury. The Raktor soldier held a horrifying smile on his face, unnerving the residents who too began to panic. Hoarding was rampant, while law and order began to break down significantly. Desertion was becoming the norm, even as General Verian returned to the city, trying to use her own failing authority to stem the tide of crime. &quot;We will persevere! The walls of Ocra will hold, and we will repel those who encroach on our sovereignty with impunity! The loss is but a temporary setback, one which will recover from and strike back with full force!&quot;</p><p>Some of the residents were buoyed by the General's assertions, but Culo was not an idiot. He had been watching the baggage train of the soldiers continuously filter into the city, each of them more injured and weakened than the last. Disease and sickness spread like wildfire through the ranks, even afflicting the refugees and residents themselves, creating even more unrest. As much as Culo hated the current authority and wanted to use this opportunity to strike at the Versian Army, he knew it would be a foolish endeavor. Taking control of the city now through a violent revolution would only result in the city falling to Count Leon, something Culo had been instructed by Kyle not to allow.</p><p>Culo didn't know when Count Leon would arrive, but he had the Ghosts prepare to fight, gearing up for a long siege and stocking up supplies and potions to survive the imminent defense. Any supplies from Desham now was routed to him. <em>Kyle will attack only when the main force arrives, not before. This means we have to hold the city on our own with the garrison.</em></p><p>He tried to probe the Versian Field Army for any information they had gathered, but even General Verian was not privy to Count Leon's movements, their observation of Aurtla planes being deterred by the Raktor army.</p><p>However, he soon didn't need the information any longer, for three days later, the stream of refugees and injured soldiers running for the safety of Ocra stopped. </p><p>No more fleeing. </p><p>No more trains of refugees clamoring to get behind the walls.</p><p>No more screaming.</p><p>Not even the usual chirps of birds and grunts of animals in the surrounding forest could be heard, not even the cricket of insects.</p><p>Just a silence that many had never seen before since the evacuations began months ago, the trenches lining the dark muddy fields ahead of the walls calm and quiet, as if all was right with the world. Some of the residents saw this as a period of calm, a few of them even thankful that there would be no more mouths to feed, but Culo knew why no more refugees were coming to Ocra.</p><p><em>This is the end of the line.</em> Culo braced himself as he watched the first advance attack divisions peek over the horizon on the next day, the flag of Count Leon's colors flying freely in the wind for all to see.</p><p>The Siege of Ocra had begun.</p>
