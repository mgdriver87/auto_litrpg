<p></p><p><strong>Chapter 105 - Tenar</strong></p><p>Kyle shied away from the streets, covering his face behind the corner of an alleyway as a military arctech wagon rolled past, the streets filled with the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Versians clamored outside of popular cake shops and temporary stall carts that served waffles of every flavor, the sweet, delectable aroma wafting through the fresh air. It was a far cry from the plight of the refugees he had witnessed just in Ocra, a world of difference apart.</p><p>&quot;Feldon, make sure the directions are correct. We're looking for the Golden Days bookstore.&quot; Kyle ordered to the wide-eyed Feldon, who hurriedly pulled out a rolled-up piece of paper, reading through the steps written by Culo.</p><p>&quot;Says here it's two blocks down from here, assuming this map is accurate...&quot; Feldon rotated the rough scribbles on the paper to match their current location, squinting at the nearby road sign. &quot;Just gotta walk straight to that roundabout at the end of the road and make a right, we should see it along the sidewalk.&quot;</p><p>Kyle nodded, stuffing his handgun back into his belt's rear holster before gripping Masir's arm tightly. &quot;If you try to run...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, of course!&quot; Masir bobbed his head vigorously.</p><p>&quot;Good. Let's move.&quot; Kyle shoved him out onto the open street, and the trio began to act normal, walking through the crowded streets without giving themselves away. Kyle noticed a few weird glares from nearby pedestrians and even wagon drivers staring at him, clearly intrigued by the fake acne and warts on his face. He clenched his fist tightly, restraining his boiling internal rage. <em>Once I get back to Haui...</em></p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by the sight of a grand statue placed right smack in the center of the roundabout. Little red flags waved, indicating tour groups being led around the statue, which was surprisingly half-broken and soiled with red paint and graffiti. &quot;Death to the Count...&quot; Kyle read it out loud under his breath.</p><p>Quite a few Versia tourists who were on their first trip to the capital were staring in awe, with even a school group being guided by three teachers, along with a few filming crews who were already using light-capturers. [It was here where former President Johan first made his famous independence speech, along with current Acting President Mornero; long live his name.]</p><p>Kyle played along with the act, his path taking him slightly closer to the light-capturers to get a better look. His eyes scanned for any telltale signs, before he finally found a mark - one indicated that the Sliver Screens had produced the light-capturer. <em>Interesting, must have been smuggled here. I certainly don't recall approving the sale to Versia.</em></p><p>One of the actors being filmed was on break, taking a sip from a flask as he glanced at Kyle and nearly spat out his water in shock. Kyle gritted his teeth and pressed on, ignoring the whispers. As he followed Masir and Feldon, he felt the actor approaching him from behind, nearly forcing him to draw his handgun on instinct. Yet he refrained, turning around with a light smile. The actor recoiled a little but summoned the courage to say what he wanted to say: &quot;If you need a referral to a nearby hospital or clinic, I can provide you with some. All Versians have free healthcare so long as you claim from the government in the next-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm perfectly happy with how I look, thank you very much.&quot; Kyle's eyebrow twitched as he shrugged off the man, continuing to follow Masir and Feldon along the street towards the liaison point. As he caught up with them, he found Feldon sniggering to himself, though it was stopped quickly by a sharp glare from Kyle. &quot;Don't laugh at me - you don't look that much better yourself. If you want to continue laughing, feel free to return.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, sir. I'll do my best.&quot; Feldon spoke with an emotionless robotic tone as though he hadn't been on the verge of tears before.  Still, Kyle was impressed with what the actor had told him. <em>Welfare benefits – I’m surprised a country at this age would support universal social security.</em> Generally, he would have expected a city to turn out exactly like Raktor, with the industrialists and landowners at the very top. Instead, it felt like he had entered a socialist paradise of sorts. <em>Disgusting.</em></p><p>While the trio walked, Kyle noticed a few Versian soldiers patrolling as well, spotting a similar tattoo on their necks much like the Nest workers at the catacombs dock beneath. He kept his gaze low, avoiding eye contact as they brushed past each other through the crowd of Versians that seemed to never end.</p><p>Soon, they found themselves outside the mentioned bookstore, a quaint little place that had a distinct smell of leather and binding glue that permeated the atmosphere.  A few customers were already in there between the towering shelves that touched the moldy ceiling, some of them eyeing Kyle as they entered through the door, a tiny bell ringing to announce their entry.</p><p>He followed Feldon towards one of the shelves nested in the corner of the bookstore, ignoring the half-asleep cashier at the front counter who had dozed off reading an unfamiliar book about the different breeding methods for likrids. Kyle shuffled through the tight, narrow spaces of the shelves, coming face to face with a series of encyclopedias that stretched half the length of the shelves, their red leather jackets luxurious and intimidating.</p><p>&quot;Now, we just need this...&quot; Feldon rummaged in his pocket, pulling out a tiny little arctech necklace much like Kyle's own Necklace of Healing. He placed it against the spine of one of the encyclopedias’s volume, the shape of the necklace's sigil matching the invisible groove exactly. Closing his eyes, Feldon took a deep breath and channeled arcia energy, the bright blue arcs visible slightly under his skin as it arced towards the sigil, powering it up before it began to sputter and falter, the process failing.</p><p>&quot;Are you a mage by any chance?&quot; Masir began to look at Feldon with far more respect. &quot;And here I thought you were just a bumbling fool, but I haven't seen many with good control over their internal arcia energ-&quot;</p><p>His words were caught in his throat as Kyle pushed Feldon aside roughly, placing his own hand and channeling the arcia energy at a far faster rate. The sigil lit up and glowed brilliantly, traces glistening from the imbued arcia energy as the shelve began to slightly shift apart, revealing a small tiny gap in the wall near the bottom that could only fit one person at a time by crawling.</p><p>Kyle did the same as always: he forced Masir in, followed by Feldon while he took up the rear, pocketing the necklace, clambering into the tight space, and ensuring that the shelf closed behind them. &quot;Move up, you fat cunt.&quot; Feldon prodded Masir's butt with his finger, causing Masir to yelp slightly and scramble faster.</p><p>The cramped tunnel sloped downwards until they reached a main tunnel, one large enough for them to stand up and lit by arctech lanterns that had just been freshly installed. They squeezed their way through, coming face to face with a heavy wooden door only furnished with a single eyeslit that opened the instant Masir stepped close.</p><p>&quot;One without tyranny.&quot; A female voice echoed behind the door, her eyes scanning the trio suspiciously.</p><p>Kyle held up the sigil of the necklace. &quot;The revolution repeats itself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The birds are no longer caged.&quot; The female voice pressed.</p><p>&quot;Even the wyvern's nest is not safe.&quot;</p><p>Three latches were unlocked one by one on the other side of the door with loud clangs, the door swinging open to reveal a small but proficient hideout furnished with simple bunk beds and supplies to last a month. Only four members were inside, including the lady who had just asked them the codewords. She stuck out her hand, shaking that of Kyle's. &quot;You must be the leader Culo mentioned was coming. Though I didn't know you would look like... that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am, and you must be the famous Lisa. Culo put you in charge of Tenar operations.&quot; Kyle finally wiped off his makeup, revealing a stunning, charismatic face, making Lisa instantly blush from even the obvious false compliment.</p><p>&quot;Well, please, make yourself at home. I was expecting four of you, including Sasha...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have her on another mission. We'll meet up with her later.&quot; Kyle plodded down on a nearby chair, tapping the table and motioning for the rest to gather around while Lisa shut the door. &quot;Let's not waste time - we're on the clock, and we need to take stock of what we have and what we know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Lisa automatically deferred to Kyle's authority, hurriedly following her training, knowing that Kyle was the boss of Culo and Sasha and, thus, must be a great man. &quot;As you can see, it's been exceedingly difficult to recruit manpower in Tenar. The standard of living here is just too good for anyone here to even fathom rebelling against the current ruling power. Both Acting President Monero and Harrison right now have a sort of fanatical cult behind them.&quot;</p><p>Kyle nodded his head in agreement. With such strong welfare options in place, the people must feel far removed from war and hardly affected. &quot;This is not the same as the refugee camp at Ocra.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly. Without enough dissatisfaction, we won't be able to gather enough men to do anything significant. Not to mention that there has been an increased presence of Nest and military troops, trying to ensure stability and hunt down us.&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;Honestly, I haven't left this hideout for about three days now. It's just too dangerous out on the streets.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about the catacombs?&quot; Feldon ventured. &quot;They seem complicated enough to hide there and evade detection. Maybe we can try hitting some Nest locations and take them over, like that Nest dock we just came through.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, that will cause them to crash down on us even more. Do we have a map of the catacombs?&quot; Kyle asked Lisa.</p><p>&quot;Sadly, I believe even Nest does not know the full extent of the catacombs. It's been built more than three centuries ago and has been expanded countless times. There are rumors that some tunnels even lead all the way to Creuliz.&quot; Lisa shook her head. &quot;If we want to know about the catacombs, we need to recruit someone who is extremely familiar with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How are we going to recruit them? Anyone who knows the true extent is either a Nest member or probably some Versian government employee. Unless...&quot; Feldon tapped his chin. &quot;You already know someone who is a proper candidate. Is it Minister Dekar?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Minister Dekar is indeed rumored to be in Tenar, but we have our eyes on another potential recruit - Zayin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p><p>&quot;An old revolutionary, one of the original crew who established Versia. We have concrete confirmation from our observations that he is working as a slave in a sweatshop in the catacombs near Section 5A. I believe if we can save him, we can use him as a way to get into contact with Minister Dekar while achieving information on the layout of the tunnels.&quot;</p><p><em>That was just where we were.</em> Kyle pondered for a moment, before he glanced at Masir, who quickly looked away, acting like he had not just listened to the current conversation. As his mind raced, putting the pieces in place, a plan began to form together in Kyle's head, a small grin growing on his face. He abruptly slammed the table loudly, standing up to his full height. &quot;We will continue to monitor the situation from this hideout, and then determine a correct time to establish contact with this 'Zayin'. Understood?&quot;</p><p>Everyone but Masir nodded, dispersing to their respective bunk areas to continue their work. Feldon took up the lead position alongside Lisa, though there wasn't much to lead, with only three other Ghosts here. However, Kyle suddenly pulled Lisa aside, whispering to her quietly: &quot;How many other hideouts do we have here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have three more, though they are quite far away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How fast can we move?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If necessary, we can cave in the entire place with a few explosives in about ten minutes. It will take about an hour to reach the next one though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Kyle sat back down on the table, grabbing a nearby ink pen and scribbling furiously into a letter quickly and sealing it with wax. &quot;Have a Ghost take Masir above ground and use him to deliver the letter to the Alchemist Guild's branch here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm... okay, but what if Masir runs?&quot; Lisa was well aware of who he was, feeling this mission was a bit dangerous.</p><p>&quot;Tell the Ghost to give chase, but immediately give up if there's any chance of being caught. Our lives are more important than some message. Remember, it's critical that the Ghost is not seen delivering the message, understood? This message is critical to taking down Nest.&quot; Kyle spoke a bit louder, earning Masir's attention.</p><p>&quot;Understood.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good.&quot; Kyle watched as Lisa explained the task to another female Ghost member, who in turn grabbed the letter and Masir along, dragging him out of the hideout unwillingly.</p><p>Masir grunted as he clutched onto the edge of the door, struggling to hold on while the Ghost tugged him in the other direction. &quot;What are you making me do?! Please, don't kill me! I already did everything you asked for; I want no part of this stupid rebel movement!&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is your last task. Do this well and I will set you free, how about that?&quot; Kyle smiled.</p><p>Somehow, Masir doubted that was true, but he still took the chance, letting go of the door and following the Ghost back out towards the bookstore. They clambered through the cramped tunnel once more, exiting normally through the tiny gap as Masir dusted off his clothes. He looked around sheepishly, planning to dash away from the Ghost, when his wrist was suddenly expertly gripped by her, twisting behind his back in an arm lock. He yelped in pain, turning his face only to see the smooth barrel of a handgun aimed right squarely between his eyes.</p><p>&quot;Don't try to run, or else. Now move to the Alchemist Guild's branch on Asha Street.&quot; The Ghost spat before placing Kyle's letter into his arm and releasing him. Masir staggered forward, rubbing his wrists gingerly as they left the bookstore, the Ghost trailing him quietly from behind through the street.</p><p><em>Fucking hell, if I'm spotted delivering the letter, I will be marked as an accomplice despite me being a prisoner!</em> Masir's eyes darted about with a shifty gaze, looking for every possible angle of escape. Yet, he could see the Ghost watching him extremely closely, expertly following his every move and cutting off most places he could try to hide in. More importantly, he instinctively knew that if he tried to run with his unfit body, the Ghost would catch up with him in an instant.</p><p>He bided his time, carefully walking towards Asha Street and constantly keeping a vigilant lookout. For some unknown reason, there were hardly any military or Nest patrols around. <em>Where are those fuckers when you need them the most?!</em> Masir never thought he would say that of Nest, but dire times called for brand-new allegiances.</p><p>As he turned the corner into Asha Street, the area was brimming with activity - a relic market with merchants propped up wooden tables covered with a brilliant cloth, displaying arctech equipment that was specially designed or excavated from long-forgotten ruins in the Versian wilderness. There was a clear difference in the type of crowd that was here under the colorful fabrics hung across the buildings that blocked the harsh daylight compared to the outside.</p><p>Adventurers, explorers, and mercenaries were all browsing weapons, armor, and equipment out in the open, thanks to Versia not having a ban on it. Even arctech guns and handguns were sold by the dozens, displayed prominently on carpets along the floor. Masir shifted through the crowd quickly, his steps picking up, hoping to lose the Ghost. Yet as he turned around, he saw the Ghost keeping pace with him well, only a few steps behind. They were getting close to the branch of the Alchemist Guild's branch, its store sign hanging on a bright metallic pole in the distance.</p><p>As luck would have it, Masir finally spotted an entourage of what seemed to be well-armored mercenaries decked out in arctech knight armor coupled with gas masks covering the lower half of their faces. Four of them guarded a well-dressed lady, her dark green cheongsam sticking out like a sore thumb against the more practical adventurer's leather outfit and the frilly dresses of the ladies who shot a few jealous glares towards her. But all of that hardly mattered to Masir - what mattered the most was that they all sported the same neck tattoo, the lady's one the most obvious to those who knew what it meant. <em>Nest!</em></p><p>Masir immediately sprinted towards the lady, prompting the mercenaries guarding her to immediately draw their weapons, all of them brimming with arctech pieces of equipment far beyond the budget of a regular mercenary. The front two mercenaries caught Masir right by the neck, restraining his arm and pinning him to the ground. Masir struggled against the weight of the heavy armor, spitting saliva on the ground as he tried to speak. &quot;Y-Yona! It's me, Masir!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Masir...? I know a lot of 'Masir'. Most of them are dead.&quot; The lady murmured, the crowd in the Asha Street relic market knowing well enough to steer clear of the commotion, not willing to get tangled up in Nest business if they could help it.</p><p>&quot;It's me, Masir, from Ocra?! You know, Masir's Boys leader?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rings somewhat of a bell. Search him.&quot; The lady waved her manicured hands dismissively, one of the mercenaries quickly ruffling Masir's pockets, finding the sealed letter in his palm. The mercenary continued to search before tugging out the license paper and reading it.</p><p>&quot;He has a license with us, Lady Yona.&quot; The mercenary held it up for her to read, though she did not touch it herself.</p><p>&quot;So it seems... And what business do you have so urgent that you had to charge at me? Appointments are to be scheduled by my servants.&quot; Yona flexed her fingers outwards, self-admiring her own fingers that overlapped her vision of the groveling Masir.</p><p>&quot;I'm being chased, I'm being chased by the Ghosts of Versia! There's a Ghost following me!&quot;</p><p>Yona's nonchalant demeanor immediately darkened. &quot;Call every Nest member nearby. Lockdown Asha Street now.&quot; She ordered a mercenary, who relayed the order.  Within seconds, some merchants and customers revealed their Nest affiliation all along the length of the street, cutting off the entrance and exit of the street. &quot;Check everyone in here. You, get up. You recognize the Ghost chasing you, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes, but I have bigger information!&quot; Masir struggled to his feet, catching his breath after being pressured by the heavy arctech knight armor of the mercenaries. &quot;Their hideout is at the Golden Days bookstore!&quot;</p><p>Yona squinted her eyes. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I've been trading slaves for ages, Yona, please, you have to believe me! They destroyed my gang and enslaved me!&quot; Masir pleaded, getting down on his knees. Despite the begging, she did not budge just yet, contemplating her next moves while the Nest mercenaries forced Masir to cooperate in their search for the Ghost. However, Masir quickly realized that the Ghost had already long escaped, most likely at the moment he sprinted towards Yona.</p><p>&quot;And how do I know this is not a trap?&quot; Yona questioned.  &quot;For all I know, you could be leading me to my death!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I'll lead you to them directly! I'll go first, but only if you guarantee my safe return to Ocra!&quot; Masir negotiated, clearly not letting go of his own survival.</p><p>&quot;Hmm...&quot; Yona seemed hesitant, making Masir flustered.</p><p>&quot;I still got more information on what the Ghosts of Versia plan to do next!&quot; Masir compromised heavily, trying to lead on Yona, who grinned in return.</p><p>&quot;Deal. Lead the way.&quot; Yona immediately rallied a dozen Nest mercenaries, marching back through the streets leading towards the Golden Day bookstore, the Versian citizens stepping aside as they watched the squad force their way through the densely crowded streets.</p><p>Masir quickly found the bookstore once more, but something was clearly off - all of the customers inside as well as the cashier was already missing. Yona immediately noticed the nervousness of Masir, prompting her to use a few handsigns, ordering the Nest mercenaries to scout the area, checking for any other routes out.</p><p>&quot;Lady Yona, this is the only exit and entrance as far as we can tell.&quot; One of the mercenaries reported back.</p><p>&quot;Then get the informants nearby to relay any suspicious behavior they can recall coming from the bookstores. I want faces and names where possible. Get three men to go in with Masir now.&quot; Yona ordered.</p><p>Masir gingerly stepped forward, feeling like he had jumped from one boiling pot to another as he felt the three Nest mercenaries behind him aiming their barrels right at his body, prepared for any potential betrayal. They stepped forward with great care, checking every movement to make sure they did not trip any traps. As they reached the same bookshelf as before, Masir soon realized that he did not have the necklace required to open the shelf, nor did he have the requisite control over his own internal arcia energy. &quot;There's this tiny little groove in the spine of the book right here that we need to-&quot;</p><p>Before he could finish, the Nest mercenary slung his rifle behind his back, grabbing the shelf with two gloved hands and pulling it apart, the shelf nearly crushing Masir as he scampered to the side. One by one, the shelves crashed into each other, collapsing like a domino with a series of loud bangs, kicking a swirling cloud of dust that choked out the men inside.</p><p>Sure enough, there was a tiny gap present in the wall. With two Nest mercenaries watching Masir carefully, the lead mercenary entered first, before confirming that the tunnel was safe. Soon they entered, putting Masir right in front of them as a body shield while pushing forward. As they reached the end of the tunnel, the bolted wooden door was latched shut. Masir walked up nervously, rasping his knuckles on the hardwood. &quot;Uhm, Lisa? Kyle?&quot;</p><p>No one replied, only an eerie silence resting in the cramped tunnel. The lead mercenary immediately charged forward, slamming his entire knight armor into the door with his whole body weight. The thick door snapped off its hinges nailed into the cavernous wall, collapsing with a loud thud to reveal an abandoned hideout, supplies, and documents still left about.</p><p>&quot;Wha-&quot; Masir stuttered, unable to understand how the hideout could have been abandoned in such a short timeframe. The three Nest mercenaries scoured the hideout for traps, not finding anything while the lead thumbed through the documents left behind, his eyes widening before activating the arctech radio on his belt.</p><p>&quot;Lady Yona, there seems to be information about Ghosts of Versia in here. We've cleared the place of traps as far as we can tell.&quot; The lead spoke into the radio's microphone.</p><p>[I'll be there shortly.]</p><p>Soon, the hideout was filled with six Nest mercenaries and Yona herself, who read over the documents slowly. &quot;Good work, Masir. Looks like you'll be returning to Ocra safely after all-&quot;</p><p>All of a sudden, a series of deafening booms exploded the walls apart in a dazzling ball of flame that threatened to engulf the hideout, the support of the cavernous ceiling immediately giving and causing a rockslide that crushed the Nest mercenaries into paste despite their heavy armor without a chance. Before the incoming rocks and fire could smash into Yona, she instinctively flicked a paper fan apart, one which glowed with thick arcia lines that brimmed with energy.</p><p>A sharp, hemispherical barrier of wind formed around her, the gusts strong enough to divert the crumbling ceiling all around her while the foundation of the building above threatened to crush her as well. Grunting, she flicked the fan furiously, drawing winds from the meager air around that concentrated into a stream that pushed the foundation slightly to the side, plunging into the ground right next to her. With one more flick of her fan, she let out a gust that extinguished the remaining fire that had already burnt through the documents.</p><p>Yona let out a heavy breath as the rockslide finally stopped, her rage brimming on the surface while she glanced down at a squeamish Masir who was still cowering with his eyes closed right next to Yona, his hands wrapped around his head in a fetal position. &quot;You fucking bitch, you lured us into a trap!&quot; She swung her fan again, this time the wind slamming Masir into a nearby pile of rubble painfully, his mouth gagging. &quot;Give me one good reason why I shouldn't bury you right next to my men!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please, please, I didn't know, I didn't know!&quot; Masir pleaded, but Yona grabbed him by the collar, her seemingly frail body surprisingly strong enough to drag him through the tunnel towards a Nest mercenary who had entered the tunnel, alerted by the sounds of an explosion.</p><p>&quot;Take this man back to the catacombs, right this instant! I want to know who the fuck let him in!&quot; Yona roared, smacking Masir on the back of his head and knocking him out cold.</p><p>Masir suddenly found himself splashed with a cold bucket of sewer water; his entire body drenched as he squirmed on the floor, his legs and arms bounded behind him. While he spluttered and tried to wipe the water off his eyes using the coarse stone floor of the catacombs, he noticed that another man had been tied up next to him as well - the guard who checked their wagon at the very first entrance. The two of them were now placed on full display in the middle of the catacomb dock right on the berth, no doubt to make a statement of them. Dock workers all gathered around, watching in morbid curiosity.</p><p>&quot;I gave you one simple job, and you couldn't even stop some Ghosts rats from entering!&quot; Yona berated the Nest guard leader as she sat on a chair facing the two accused, her eyes staring daggers at the both of them as she was flanked by two Nest mercenaries.</p><p>&quot;Lady Yona, please! I followed protocol; I checked all of his men against the wanted list and for signs of affiliation. Masir had a proper license paper as well!&quot; The Nest guard pleaded his case, but he was clearly not getting through to Yona. Instead, Yona snapped her fingers, prompting another Nest mercenary to walk up to the Nest guard, attaching what seemed to be an anchor to the ropes that tied the guard's leg. With a solid throw, the guard was dragged screaming into the depths of the dock, the bubbles the only remnant of his struggle. The crowd of dock workers winced slightly, reminded of their role and position in Nest.</p><p>Masir's face paled, quickly racking his brain as to how he could get out of this. &quot;WAIT! Wait, wait, wait, I know where the Ghosts of Versia are going to attack next!&quot; He exclaimed, trying to get Yona's attention.</p><p>&quot;If this is another trap...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, no, I'm pretty sure this is the truth! You can verify this for yourself - I know there's an old Versian revolutionary known as Zayin, he's working in the sweatshop at Section 5A! Please, you have to let me go, I was enslaved by them in the first place!&quot;</p><p>Yona whispered to the mercenary next to her, prompting him to pass Kyle's sealed letter to her. &quot;And what about this letter?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know anything about its contents! I was only asked to pass the letter to the Alchemist Guild branch on Asha Street!&quot; Masir immediately told the truth.</p><p>Yona had her mercenary open the letter in case it had been laced with a contact poison. When it was verified, she read it carefully, though her rage only began to boil even more, her face fuming with anger. &quot;YOU! YOU HAD THIS PLANNED ALL ALONG!&quot;</p><p>&quot;H-huh?!&quot; Masir looked around confusedly. &quot;What's in that letter?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't play dumb. Since you want to go back to Ocra, death by drowning is hardly enough for you - you two, send him to the military to be conscripted as a recruit. Let him be cannon fodder on the frontlines since he loves Ocra so much.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, no, please!&quot; Masir's struggles and screams had no weight on Yona as he was hauled away to an unknown fate, her fury now directed at the contents of the letter. Without another word, she only gave a slight glance at the bubbles still coming from the Nest guard leader that was drowning.</p><p>&quot;Make sure that we retrieve the anchor when he's dead. Metal is precious in wartime.&quot; Yona ordered without any emotions, leaving the dock with her mercenaries in tow. The surrounding dock workers began to discuss among each other as soon as she left, curious about what had just happened.</p><p>&quot;Who's that lady?&quot; One of the newer dock workers asked naively. &quot;She looks pretty nice.&quot;</p><p>An older veteran worker chuckled, patting the newer dock worker on the back. &quot;Same here, but you better give up your hope of ever getting close to her. She's one of the vice leaders of Nest here in Versia - we won't be making it to that rank anytime soon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? Maybe I can prove myself?&quot;</p><p>&quot;By what? Hauling crates? Sure, very inspiring.&quot;</p><p>&quot;HEY! What are you all hanging about for? The shift ain't over just yet!&quot; One of the nearby Nest guards hollered after them.</p><p>As the surrounding dock workers began to disperse, one of the more nervous dock workers did not return to his post, instead moving carefully towards a hidden nook behind large crates of supplies, finding a hiding spot. He glanced over his shoulder, making sure that he wasn't about to be caught, before cracking open one of the crates, revealing a tiny compact arctech radio. Tuning the frequency, he whispered into the microphone. &quot;Jovial is the hay in the den.&quot;</p><p>[Decks will be scrubbed in war. I told you not to call me unless it's urgent.] The voice on the other side shot back angrily, forcing the nervous dock worker to squat and cower behind the crates, adjusting the volume slightly lower.</p><p>&quot;But Minister, I got some information about one of our old friends!&quot;</p><p>[Old friends?]</p><p>&quot;Zayin! Zayin has been enslaved by Nest, working at a sweatshop in Section 5A!&quot;</p><p>[That's impossible! I heard he migrated to Creuliz after the war of independence!]</p><p>&quot;Must be another lie propagated by Mornero. What else has he not lied about?&quot; The nervous dock worker's voice was thick with hatred. &quot;What should we do?&quot;</p><p>[What else? Of course, we're going to save him.]</p><p>&quot;But Nest also knows about him - it could be a trap! We've worked so hard to keep under the radar -&quot;</p><p>[There's no choice. Today is the day that I, Dekar, will stand and fight for those who will walk with me to freedom!]</p><p><strong>Chapter 106 - Triple Trap</strong></p><p>&quot;Right about now, Nest should be mobilizing to defend Section 5A,&quot; Kyle explained to Lisa while the rest of the members continued to reorganize.</p><p>&quot;That's not good, isn't it? It'll make it harder for us to get into contact with Zayin.&quot; Lisa frowned, clearly mulling over something Kyle couldn't give two shits about.</p><p>&quot;Here's what is going to happen: The information given to Nest most likely should have leaked to Minister Dekar. I am confident he has his own informants embedded with Nest. Any large-scale action by them would go undetected. All we have to do is wait until he strikes. If he doesn't move, then it's no loss to us as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No loss to us? We lost a hideout!&quot; Lisa bristled with fury. &quot;We only have one backup hideout left, and I would very much prefer if I was kept in the loop regarding such plans, especially my members.&quot; She motioned to the Ghost who had to escape Asha Street, the Ghost nodding furiously in agreement. From their point of view, Kyle was like an errant leader who had just overtaken their entire operation.</p><p>Kyle sighed. &quot;And here I thought I was dealing with adults.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What...?&quot; Lisa glared at Kyle angrily, but Kyle didn't back down at all. Instead, he overpowered Lisa through his sheer dominating aura that seemed to suddenly seep from every single pore on his skin, exuding confidence and strength.</p><p>&quot;If the mission was revealed to her, it would have tipped off Masir and any nearby Nest personnel who might be watching. It needed to be as authentic of a slip-up as possible, and she did it perfectly. I find it hard to believe that you are angry at getting closer to our goal.&quot; Kyle pointed out. &quot;Consider this - in just two hours since I've arrived, we have gotten more information than in the week you have been posted here, and we have a concrete plan to nab both Minister Dekar and Zayin. Now, please, inform me - what would be your alternative?&quot;</p><p>Lisa wanted to retort but decided to hold back. The truth was she didn't have any other options other than to simply stake out and observe rumor spots, doing the regular leg work. She hated to admit it, but Kyle did indeed accelerate their plans significantly, her having expected to do about a month's worth of observation and embedding into the capital of Versia before obtaining any results.</p><p>&quot;If you are truly committed to the goal of a free Versia, then my methods are by far the best and quickest. Now, if we're done grumbling about the segregation of information, which is common in any hierarchical organization, let's move on, shall we?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think you're so good, but there's a massive flaw in your plan.&quot; The Ghost, who had been tricked into escorting Masir, rebutted Kyle, clearly indignant about being used as bait in some sense.</p><p>Kyle smiled, sitting back in a wooden chair and leaning back. &quot;Please, do enlighten me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your plan hinges on the fact that Minister Dekar comes to 'save' this Zayin. Now that we are in this new hideout, how do we know what's happening within the catacombs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are plenty of ways to enter the catacombs when one's in Tenar.&quot; Kyle waved his hands dismissively. &quot;Your team has already marked out multiple entry points nearby within fifteen minutes. There should be no issue entering it.&quot;</p><p>The Ghost scoffed. &quot;Still, the moment Minister Dekar attempts to save Zayin, it will take time for information to come back to us before we can respond at all, even if you place an informant there that will not be caught by Nest!&quot;</p><p>Kyle grinned. &quot;Oh, but I have that covered. You do not need to worry about that. All you have to do is do your job well, and everything will fall into place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you calling me a pawn!?&quot; The Ghost started, but Lisa held her back, shaking her head.</p><p>&quot;Look, we're all a little frazzled after losing our first hideout-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because of him! We were doing perfectly fine, but he decided to go and reveal its location to Nest without even consulting us-&quot;</p><p>Kyle rasped his fingers on the holster of his chair. &quot;There seems to be a misunderstanding here.&quot; He slowly rose out of his chair, cracking his arms before standing squarely in front of the Ghost. &quot;I am the last word on everything here - not Lisa, not Feldon, not Culo, not Sasha, not you. Me. Alone. You have no say in any overarching mission plan that I have in mind, and you will not for the foreseeable future.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think you can waltz in here and just-&quot; The Ghost couldn't complete her sentence, her face being grabbed by Kyle's hand firmly and forced down in a powerful shove, her head slamming into the ground violently and nearly knocking her out. Lisa instantly drew out a handgun, aiming it at Kyle, but Kyle did not care, instead lifting the squirming Ghost up to eye level, her feet dangling while she struggled and clasped Kyle's outstretched arm, trying to remove his hand to no avail.</p><p>Kyle dragged the Ghost's head near to his face, whispering into her ear. &quot;If I sense any dissatisfaction or refusal to carry out orders, you will no longer be treated as an asset, but as a liability. And you do not want to see what treatment the Ghosts of Versia has prescribed for such a liability. Are we clear? And if you're done playing around in your fantasy of morals and unity, you can drop the handgun, Lisa. Culo told me you were over it, but I see some of it still lingers.&quot;</p><p>The struggling Ghost nodded vigorously, prompting Kyle to let go of her face that had almost been crushed in his grip, her body flopping onto the ground. Lisa, too, lowered her handgun, slightly frightened at the sheer strength that Kyle exuded. What would have happened if she fired at him? Her body shuddered slightly as she holstered it, helping up the Ghost from the ground. The rest of the members stared in shock as well, save for Feldon, who was fast asleep in a simple bunk bed and snoring away through the disagreement.</p><p>&quot;Cross me again, and we will have problems. As long as you follow my orders, we will see a free Versia. Understood?&quot; Kyle dusted off his shirt and arranged his hair, glaring at Lisa. &quot;I expect a 'Yes, sir'.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Lisa mumbled reluctantly.</p><p>&quot;Continue with your work.&quot; Kyle dismissed them, retreating back to the chair where he was sitting. It was unfortunate that he had to resort to violence to rein in the members, but it was clear that they harbored resentment against him for working behind their backs. He needed to quickly establish a clear line of authority, and any form of pandering would have just made him look weak and unsteady. With such a tight deadline, appeasing a few rebel members was at the very bottom of his list of priorities. <em>However, I should keep an eye on the two of them; they will most likely betray me in the future.</em></p><p>He decided to check in on Sasha, who had been staking out the sweatshop at Section 5A for two hours now as well. &quot;Any updates?&quot;</p><p>[There's an increase in Nest guards, that's for sure. I'm counting about two dozen of them armed to the teeth, plus two mercenaries decked in knight armor.]</p><p>&quot;Need a resupply?&quot;</p><p>[No, I can handle it for another eight hours.]</p><p>&quot;Right. I'll inform you of the new hideout location when you're done.&quot; Kyle ended the conversation. <em>Two dozen Nest guards won't be easy for Minister Dekar to break through.</em></p><p>With that in mind, Kyle focused on what he should be doing - planning backup hideouts and escape plans. It was clear that they were the underdogs in this city and that in order to execute a successful guerrilla campaign, they needed to have as many bases as possible to shift between, never letting the enemy corner them. In the event that they were surrounded, Kyle also needed to figure out possible safehouses or even routes that would allow the rebels to escape Tenar if necessary.</p><p>He had no doubt that the moment he launched an attack against Harrison using the Ghosts of Versia, a shadow war would break out all over the city and the catacombs. Even if he did not initiate any attack in the next few months, he could not guarantee that Harrison would not suddenly decide to raid or purge the Ghosts out of their hiding spots.</p><p>As such, Kyle carefully inspected blueprints for the city one after the other while the rest of the Ghosts and Feldon took a much-needed rest. He worked tirelessly until night fell on Versia, the brightly lit streets filled with wonderous lights and arctech billboards that lit up like fireworks, citizens enjoying a well-deserved dinner after a hard day of work, or going on dates at romantic venues under a simple lantern's light.</p><p><em>It seems a bit hard to escape Tenar through a land route...</em> Kyle reached a conclusion after working so long on the city blueprints. It was as if the Nest and military had cut off every possible entrance and exit into Tenar, but Kyle felt that such a statement could not be true. <em>There must be a secret passage in the catacombs. Either Minister Dekar or Zayin would have known about it.</em></p><p>As if on cue, Sasha's voice was transmitted over the Designate Follower engraving right into his brain. [Sir, I'm seeing movement here. It looks to be Minister Dekar's men.]</p><p>&quot;How many did he bring?&quot;</p><p>[I can't see all of them, but it looks like there are just five of them. One of them matches the portrait of Minister Dekar.]</p><p>&quot;Perfect.&quot; The plan was coming all together. Kyle got off his seat, moving over to the snoring Feldon and smacking him awake. &quot;Get up. We got work to do.&quot;</p><p>@@@@@</p><p>The rushing tide of the catacombs flowed incessantly through the entirety of Tenar, the water carrying refuse and chemicals dumped by errant factories, cumulating in a swirling stream of murky sludge that deposited along the bends and turns of the canals. Despite the clear inhospitality of the toxic environment, a lone frog the size of a cat waited patiently; its transparent bulbous skin masked amid the glistening mud while it watched carefully, beady eyes seemingly locked straight ahead into the darkness.</p><p>Even as a few minutes passed, the frog didn't budge a single inch, acting completely stationary until a distinctive whizzing sound could be heard approaching fast. Within a split second, arcia energy swelled up in the frog's body, the veins beneath the translucent skin charging up an enchantment as it blasted out a small but fast arcia bolt. A bright flash accompanied a dull thud as a tiny flying salamander crashed into the water, a smoking hole in its guts. The bolt's sound could hardly be heard over the rushing stream.</p><p>Before the salamander could be washed away, the frog leaped out from its hiding position, moving as close to the edge of the water as possible and shooting out a long tongue that wrapped around the salamander, pulling it out. In an instant, the frog swallowed the salamander whole, letting out a satisfying burp.</p><p>Suddenly, the frog felt familiar tremors approaching like raindrops in synchronization, prompting it to dive deeper into the sludge, burrowing into a nice little hole as it digested its latest meal, the tremors passing right over and stopping. The frog had little time to react as a sharp spearhead stabbed right down into the sludge, impaling both it and the tiny salamander in its belly, bodily fluids gushing out as it was unceremoniously dragged out to face two humans carrying arctech lanterns.</p><p>&quot;Hey, check it out. One stab, one kill. We'll be eating good tonight.&quot; The first human grinned as he opened a container on his back, stuffing the impaled frog in and pulling out the spearhead.</p><p>&quot;Are you sure we should be doing this? Shouldn't we be guarding the sweatshop? If Yona or her men find out, we're skiving...&quot; The other looked around with a shifty glance, clearly reluctant about eating the frog.</p><p>The first Nest guard sighed while keeping his hunting spearhead. &quot;We're not skiving; we're being resourceful. You have no idea how delicious this little guy is. People would pay big money for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yea, but look, there's something in its belly. Don't think that guy is edible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh, guess you're right.&quot; The first Nest guard took a closer look at the container, seeing the half-alive tiny salamander trying to crawl free from the ruptured frog's belly, its movements sluggish. &quot;It's a dog eat dog world, never tried it but always a first time for everything, right? Right?&quot;</p><p>He glanced behind his shoulder, noticing that the second Nest guard was conspicuously missing, including his arctech lantern. Alarm bells began to ring in his head as he carefully paced his steps around, his other hand already on his handgun while he held the lantern forward, keeping close to the walls while moving forward.</p><p>The wall next to him suddenly shifted, the bricks readjusting to reveal a pair of hands that lunged forward, grabbing him by the neck and immediately twisting his head hard, far beyond what it could handle. His neck muscles torn and spine ruptured by the sudden force, he could only watch in pain as his body crumpled to the floor, the gap in the wall opening to reveal Minister Dekar decked out in armor and a Versian rifle. His face was masked with camouflaged paint.</p><p>&quot;All clear. Let's move.&quot; Dekar motioned behind him, prompting a small group of armed men to follow him out, each of their faces disguised by paint as the five of them scurried along the canal's pathway, trekking over slippery algae-infested tiles dating back centuries. The satchels full of pellet canisters rattled on their belts with each step they took while checking every single corner for other Nest guards' patrol.</p><p>No words were exchanged, their faces all grim as they focused on the mission ahead, Section 5A's sweatshop. As soon as they came within range of the pier's lone arctech lantern, Dekar held up a clenched fist, ordering the squad to stop. &quot;Two guards at the entrance near the pier. Potions, now.&quot;</p><p>Dekar and his men immediately pop vials of Strength and Stamina potions, a sense of newfound power coursing through their bodies the moment they finish it. With a single hand sign, Dekar's men moved forward without hesitation.</p><p>Their footsteps were immediately heard by the two Nest guards, who spun to see four armed men aiming rifles at them. Before either of them could pull out their guns, pellets already whizzed through the air with murderous precision, tearing holes through their cranial cavities, the last sound they made in their lives being the splashes in the water as they toppled over the edge of the pier.</p><p>&quot;Hey, what's going on out there? You idiots still shooting fish in the water?&quot; A gruff voice echoed from beyond the entrance of the sweatshop, Dekar's men quickly hugging as close as they could to the wall, shuffling silently nearer to the entrance. The moment the owner of the gruff voice stepped out towards the pier, Dekar grabbed him by the mouth, muffling him while using a knife in another hand to slit his throat, keeping the Nest guard's mouth tightly closed as the life ebbed away from his body, squirming intermittently as the lungs were choked with his own blood.</p><p>Dekar's men were experienced, quickly shifting the dead guard's body out of the way while taking up position, preparing to breach the entrance. Dekar held up three fingers, slowly counting down. The moment he clenched his fist, the first two men barged their way into the sweatshop, guns swiveling and immediately shooting the nearest three Nest guards in rapid succession, not giving them any time to react.</p><p>Yet there were far more than three Nest guards in the wider factory area, filled to the brim with wide-eyed slaves of all origins, even a few hobgoblins. All of them seemed to be working on sewing and stitching up military uniforms in a never-ending production line, thousands of uniforms stacked up high in crates waiting to be delivered to Ocra.</p><p>The moment the bodies hit the floor, the slaves around screamed, inciting a panicked rush to get away from the fighting while Nest guards on the other end were alerted. &quot;We're under attack! Quick, report to Yona!&quot;</p><p>Immediately a fierce firefight broke out through the factory floor, Dekar and his men taking cover behind sewing machines and crates of wool and leather, pellets zipping by in the air as a dozen Nest guards fanned out to defensive positions and began to suppress them with overwhelming firepower.</p><p>&quot;Dekar, there are way more slaves and guards in here than expected! We should retreat!&quot; One of Dekar's men shouted over the din of gunfire and slaves scrambling to get as far away as possible from the main entrance.</p><p>&quot;Not until we get Zayin! He must be here.&quot; Dekar gritted his teeth, summoning his courage to dash out to a forward workbench, braving the withering fire that seemed to encompass the entire factory. Sliding beneath the workbench, Dekar let out a roar as he flipped the workbench over, protecting his body from the pellets that were now converging on him. With the pressure being relaxed on his men, they began to take potshots at the Nest guards, injuring and killing a few.</p><p>At the far end of the factory floor, a manager burst out of his office in anger. “Who the fuck is attacking us?” He roared at a nearby Nest guard who was cowering behind a pillar.</p><p>&quot;Sir, I don't know, but they got armor and guns far better than we do!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Damnit! Hey, you two! Time to do your job!&quot; The manager hollered into the office, from which two of Yona's mercenaries appeared from, their knight armour flaring up with arcia energy.</p><p>The Nest guards moved forward tactically, providing covering fire for each other as they shifted covers, trying to get a flanking angle on Dekar who was still behind the flipped workbench, the pellets impacting against its tough wooden surface.</p><p>&quot;Dekar, two knights!&quot; His men called out, pointing wildly in the general direction.</p><p>&quot;Are the slaves clear?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't see any of them!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it! Get down!&quot; Dekar rummaged through his pockets, tugging out a grenade. In one swift motion, he armed it and tossed it straight toward the two knights headfirst. A green point defense arcia bolt lanced out towards the grenade, but instead of knocking it away, the bolt exploded the grenade, releasing a hailstorm of shrapnel that dug right through the mercenaries' armor like a knife through hot butter, earning pained screams all around. Some of the shrapnel grazed against machinery, creating sparks that began to ignite a few crates of exposed arcite ore, a small fire starting up.</p><p>The resulting shockwave disorientated the Nest guards, buying time for Dekar's men to quickly storm the factory floor with impunity. Some of the Nest Guards tried to shoot back, but they could hardly aim properly with the loud ringing in their ears and the smoke from the growing fire eating away at the wooden crates and military uniforms.</p><p>With a sudden dash, Dekar sprinted out from cover, charging ahead, the pellets singing by his head as he could only hear the blood pounding in his ears. Swiveling the barrel to and fro, Dekar shot rapidly as quickly as he could, nailing two Nest guards in the head and chest. With his men keeping up, soon the dozen Nest guards were either dead or heavily injured, Yona's mercenaries whimpering on the floor as they tried to pluck the shrapnel bits out from their ruptured eyelids.</p><p>Dekar held no pity, immediately ending all their lives with two pellets to the head and three in the chest up close. The manager stared in horror as he watched the massacre unfold. <em>Fuck, I got to call Yona!</em> He rushed back into the office and slammed the door shut before quickly rummaging through his drawers for the arctech radio. However, before he even managed to find it, the door was kicked apart, the hinge destroyed by Dekar’s increased strength. The manager now found himself staring at two barrels aimed right at him, one of them being Dekar's own rifle. &quot;Step away from the radio if you want to live.&quot;</p><p>The manager's eyes darted about as he tried to look for a way out, gingerly raising his hand while taking one obvious step away from the table. He did not recognize Dekar due to the camouflaged paint, instead blurting out anything that could save him. “Look, I don’t know what you want, but I got money if you’re trying run a protection racket! But let me fucking remind you that it is Nest that –“</p><p>Dekar walked up and smacked the manager right in the face. “Shut the fuck up. You have a man here I'm looking for. His name is Zayin.”</p><p>“What? Nest would kill – ARGH!” A pellet burst through his calf, causing the manager to fall to the group, his face crashing against the stone floor. The sole of Dekar’s military boot rested against his face, crushing his jaw slightly.</p><p>&quot;Not if we kill you first.&quot; Dekar spat before turning around to face his men. &quot;I'll go find him myself. The rest of you, stay here and keep a lookout. We have to leave before they respond.&quot;</p><p>While Dekar's men took turns harassing the manager, Dekar himself went to search for where the slaves had run off to. Connected directly to the main factory floor were what seemed to be repurposed burial chambers, now acting as cramped housing for countless slaves far even beyond what Dekar had estimated.</p><p>The chambers were filled with as many people as they could fit inside, all living in clustered groups while huddling around what belongings and clothes they were allowed to accumulate, many of which were defective military uniforms. Some laid on unused wooden planks, their hands callused from the constant work shifts. There were close to three hundred people in the chambers, both young and old, a veritable mixed pot of all types of people. A few naïve kids stared at Dekar entering, some of them marveling at the armor that Dekar sported.</p><p>Yet the adults dared not look at Dekar in the eyes, afraid that he was from a rival gang that was simply here to take possession of them. Mothers grabbed their kids out of the way as Dekar filtered through the tight space, trying to control his emotions, focusing on finding Zayin. It wasn't until he walked past a young, shriveled-up man that he began to realize where all of these slaves were from.</p><p>He spun around, trying to confirm his assumption and asking the nearest slave. &quot;Where are you from?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where am I from...? I was born in Tenar. I grew up my whole life here.&quot; The slave replied as if it was an obvious fact, his face confused. &quot;Almost all of us are.&quot;</p><p>Dekar's heart plummeted as the truth became apparent. Many of the workers were local Versian citizens, those too poor to repay their debts or snatched off the streets, never to see the light of day anymore. Even children of eight years old and above were forced to work as well, climbing into small nook and crannies of dangerous complicated machinery to fix nuts and bolts. This was how Tenar had achieved such a perfected standard of living for those above ground.</p><p>Still, he had no time to despair. Continuing his search for Zayin, he finally noticed a grey-bearded man sitting cross-legged in the midst of a moldy pile of military uniforms and shredded leather, his skin drooping. Clear signs of malnutrition and years of muscle degradation were visible through the stick-like arms and the countless wrinkles etched on his face while his eyes stared blankly ahead. &quot;Zayin!&quot;</p><p>The old man spluttered out saliva, a weak grin growing on his face as Dekar hurriedly bent down to check his condition. Instead of embracing Dekar, Zayin used what strength he had left to smack his arm away. &quot;Look who finally decided to visit. Second-in-command Lieutenant General of the Versian Revolutionary Army, Dekar. Have you finally realized what is happening?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Zayin, I... I didn't know anything. Mornero kept all of us in the dark, it is him who lied to us. He told us that you moved to Creuliz.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hah, me? Move to Creuliz?!&quot; Zayin's eyes flared up with a hidden strength, fuelled purely by anger despite his deteriorating condition. &quot;AFTER EVERYTHING I SACRIFICED FOR-&quot; He coughed violently, his body unable to handle his rage. &quot;After everything I had sacrificed for the country, for my friends and people, and for Tenar, you think I would just up and leave? I was born here! In Tenar! My very own home ground!”</p><p>&quot;Zayin, I swear, I did not know any of this, and I will make it right. I'm going to get you out of here. We can still save Tenar and Versia if you help me, just like in old times.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm tired, Dekar. I'm tired of the old times. I'm tired of the speeches. Everywhere I went, I was tugged in a direction I never truly believed in. To me, you are the same as Johan and Mornero.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Johan did everything right by us and by the peo-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't you dare say that in front of all these people who've you let down! Do you have any idea how long I have been stuck down here? SEVEN YEARS! And it took your corruption scandal for you to finally open your eyes. All the social welfare schemes preached, all for naught and only for the well-to-do. Us lowlifes? We belong here, and I doubt you are going to be able to change anything.&quot;</p><p>Dekar clenched his fist in anger, but not towards Zayin, instead himself for not knowing how deep the corruption had taken root in the Versian government. &quot;I will do everything in my power to make this right, even if I have to face the whole of Nest and the army alone. You can count on me - no more speeches this time, only action.&quot; He grabbed Zayin's light body by the waist, hauling him upwards while ignoring Zayin's protests.</p><p>&quot;Alright, I have Zayin, we can mov-&quot; Dekar left the chambers only to be faced with an entire squadron of Yona's mercenaries surrounding him. He instinctively pulled out a side handgun from his belt, but a sudden gust of sharp, slicing wind blasted the handgun out of his grip and cut deep into his wrist. Two pellets were shot into his thighs immediately before he could retreat back into the chambers, the slaves near the chamber's entrance shrieking in fear and scampering away while Dekar fell to both knees.</p><p>&quot;Looks like Masir was right about you guys attacking after all.&quot; Yona grinned, closing her arctech paper fan with a crisp snap and walking up to the grimacing Dekar, who clutched his bleeding thighs. As she approached, Dekar summoned the strength he had left, lunging out with a hidden knife from his thigh's side pocket, stabbing right at Yona's neck.</p><p>Instead of the blade finding its mark, the tip of the blade was stopped by a swirling wind of gust, which immediately sped up and wreaked havoc all along Dekar's arm, the slices cutting deep into his flesh as he let out a roar of pain. &quot;Please don't try anything new. I still have to keep you in one piece for Mornero.&quot; Yona spoke with a smug face, the closed paper fan still glowing with arcia energy.</p><p>While Dekar winced in pain, his eyes caught sight of his squad, all of them captured and knocked unconscious as well. &quot;Worried about your friends? Don't worry, you'll be heading to the same torture room.&quot; Yona grinned, motioning with her manicured fingers for two of her mercenaries to pick Dekar and Zayin up.</p><p>Dekar struggled against the mercenaries' tight grip in a futile attempt. <em>She must have planted the trap in the first place. I was too bull-headed in trying to save Zayin.</em> He looked around for a way out, but it seemed impossible, with nearly two dozen mercenaries escorting them out onto the pier, hauling them onto a boat that began to take them out of the catacombs. Yet as he continued glancing around while the boat moved, he noticed the strange shadow of a woman in the distance, stalking them and matching the speed of the boat like an unseen ghost, her silhouette barely visible.</p><p>The boat finally approached a new stop in another part of the catacombs, the water being slowed artificially by dams and barriers to create a smooth coasting canal that led to another pier, this one is right under Asha Street. A clear underground establishment had been set up, much like the sweatshop Dekar had just raided, but the glowing neon arctech signs on the exterior showed it was of a different business.</p><p>As Dekar was forcibly dragged into it, he watched as a crowd of customers cheered and roared while they watched two ruffians have a go at each other on top of three round tables, the frames barely able to hold on as their weight continuously shifted. Sweat and blood were flung into the cheering onlookers, who heartily downed their pints and shouted.</p><p>“COME ON, YA WUSS! GRAB HIM BY THE BALLS!”</p><p>“THE EYES! AIM FOR THE EYES, YOU FUCK WIT!”</p><p>Dekar tried to ignore the flashing arctech lights glistening all around him, the underground bar clearly being run by Nest. Slave female dancers dressed in revealing clothes paraded themselves on the stage while men threw flowers at the girls non-stop as they groped another girl who was already giving them a lap dance. The kaleidoscopic lights from the tinted arctech lanterns swiveled around the floor while jazz music blasted from the surrounding arctech radios.</p><p>Yona's mercenaries shoved their way through the rowdy dancing crowd, many of the dancers clearly intoxicated by some drugs, empty potion flasks plastered with the emblem of Nest rolling on the ground or shattered by the boots of the mercenaries. Dekar continued to be hauled downstairs, deeper underground past the churning arctech engines that powered the entire establishment, until he was thrown unceremoniously into a plush velvet room, the cupboards along the walls lined with extravagant alcohol and potions of a dizzying array, converging on a gold-tinted desk.</p><p>Dekar was left to bleed out on the carpet while the rest of his men were imprisoned elsewhere. Yona paced around the bleeding Dekar while five of her mercenaries aimed their rifles directly at him, ready to fire at a moment's notice. She picked up an Euria pipe from the desk, carefully placing grounded Euria Seeds into it. &quot;So, Minister Dekar, you've been somehow evading us for the last three months. Care to explain how?&quot;</p><p>A small, confident grin grew on his face. &quot;Looks like Mornero never really paid attention back then. He should know the answer well enou-&quot;</p><p>Dekar felt the sharp tip of Yona's heel jab into his already wounded thigh, sending a wave of pain through his nerves. &quot;You know how to navigate the catacombs fully, and you're going to show us how.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So you can enslave more Versian citizens? You're a disgrace to the state and everything we have fought for!&quot; Dekar retorted, only to earn an amused expression from Yona.</p><p>&quot;Why do I care? I'm not even Versian.&quot; Yona took a deep breath on the pipe. &quot;Are you still worrying about the 'nation' even in this situation? I can't tell if you're being serious or keeping up an act.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unlike the rest of those corrupt, selfish fuckers in government, I actually believe in something beyond myself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, then, let me help you believe something in yourself.&quot; Yona bent over to whisper. &quot;You will not get out of here alive unless you help me. You can spend the rest of your miserable life rotting in a dark, damp cell, waxing lyrical about the Versian state while I decimate the rest of your stupid Ghosts of Versia.&quot;</p><p>Dekar was about to retort, but then his expression became even more confounded. &quot;What? What Ghosts of Versia?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't play dumb. I've already raided one of your hideouts at the Golden Day bookstore.&quot;</p><p>Dekar's confused look did not dissipate, only infuriating Yona even further. &quot;Fine, if you won't talk, I'll wrench it out from yo-&quot;</p><p>A sudden loud explosion resounded through the foundation of the underground bar, rocking the VIP room that they were in. &quot;You two, get out there and find out what the fuck happened!&quot; Yona immediately ordered while she grabbed Dekar by the cheek. &quot;Looks like your friends have come to rescue you. Too bad they are walking into their graves.&quot;</p><p>Dekar's confusion deepened even more while Yona continued to issue orders to defend the establishment. <em>That's not possible. I only have my five men and Zayin, no one else. Who is coming to save me?</em></p><p>Minutes passed while the tension in the room built up, Yona suddenly cognizant of the fact that the firefight was not subsiding, the sounds of fighting and screaming louder than ever. &quot;You three, flank the door's entrance. Anyone else who barges in, shoot them on the spot. I don't care if they are Nest or not! Get everyone out there fighting now!&quot;</p><p>The three mercenaries fanned out, hugging the wall where the VIP door's entrance was, their sweaty hands clutching the holster of their rifle. Through the wall, they could hear the brawl getting closer and closer, the clear, distinct sound of a body tumbling down the stairs past the arctech engines before silence reigned dominant. The bar's music had completely paused, save for the bated breaths of the mercenaries, Yona and Dekar.</p><p>Slowly, the sound of footsteps approaching the door got louder and louder. Yona quickly grabbed an arctech radio, whispering into it while she prepared her own paper fan. &quot;We need backup at the Flirty Hole, now!&quot;</p><p>But before she could get a response, a loud bang exploded the door inwards of its hinges, zooming past the cowering Dekar and crashing into the floor, kicking up a thick cloud of dust. The moment the silhouette of a body was visible at the door, the three mercenaries opened fire relentlessly, pelting the body with withering fire.</p><p>Instead, the body turned out to be a dead Nest guard, his skin now pockmarked and ragged by the hailstorm of pellets he had endured. The body was shoved aside, crashing into one of the mercenaries while an intruder moved with an alarming speed, catching another mercenary off-guard. The intruder's hand slammed into the base of the mercenary's jaw, splintering the bone internally into a dozen fragments before a handgun drilled three pellets into his chest.</p><p>Before the intruder could move to the last mercenary, a slice of wind arced forward in a straight line, forcing the intruder to dodge out of the way as the slice crashed into the wall, tearing apart the wallpaper. Yona swung the fan, forming a strong wind gust to drop Dekar close to her, aiming a handgun with her free hand toward Dekar's temple. &quot;Don't move another inch, or I'll blast his brains out. That wouldn't be too good for your rescue mission now, would it be?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh? It seems that even the great Lady Yona is wrong sometimes&quot; The intruder smirked, the dust and smoke finally clearing up enough to reveal his face. Dekar was astonished by the person. <em>Kris Greyborn?!</em></p><p>Yona squinted her eyes. &quot;Wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My mission isn't just to rescue him. I'm here to kill all of you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 107 - Slaughter</strong></p><p>Kyle ducked out of the way as a deadly wind slice carved a path through where he was just standing, his body rolling on the carpet before recovering into a running stance and charging right at Yona. Instead of retreating, Yona stood her ground, unfazed by Kyle's attack as she swung her paper fan rapidly, sending another three slices at him that threatened to corner him.</p><p>With a sleek motion, Kyle twisted his body expertly, dodging each of the slices as though it was a mere game to him. However, the moment he reached within four steps of Yona, he hurriedly retreated, narrowly avoiding a sudden swirling barrier of air, filled to the brim with metal dust that threatened to shred anything that came close.</p><p>&quot;You think you alone are enough to kill us? You coming here alone was a death sentence, though I'll take my time to wring the information out of you.&quot; Yona taunted confidently at the same moment when five Nest guards appeared at the door to the VIP room, preparing to enter and surround Kyle.</p><p>Instead, the five Nest guards found themselves shot at by Lisa and the other Ghosts, forcing them to scatter across the hallway and take cover behind their fallen comrades. Kyle took advantage of the confusion to rush forward in one decisive leap, closing the gap to the surprised Yona as the cloud of metal dust collapsed to the ground in a dazzling fall. Before she could activate her paper fan again, Kyle had already trapped her right wrist, locked by his firm grip, as he twisted it into an arm lock, trying to force Yona to drop the paper fan.</p><p>Yona grinned as she unveiled a second paper fan in her left hand, swinging it upwards to send an updraft filled with metal dust at his face, forcing Kyle to let go once more, but not without him retaliating with a side step followed by a spinning kick aimed at her head.</p><p>Swirling wind gather around Yona's arms and legs as she lashed out against the incoming kick, parrying it. The continuous stream of metal dust set off sparks against Kyle's armour, scratching it deep like a buzzsaw while Kyle continued to block counterattacks from her. With each of Yona's strike, her range was extended by the arctech fan, allowing the cloud of metal dust to lunge out like a whip. Her movements were as fluid as water, clearly trained in martial arts unbeknownst to Kyle.</p><p>&quot;Bit off more than you can chew, huh?&quot; Yona smiled as she unleashed a room-wide kick, sending an arc of metal dust in all directions, lodging them into the wall in a circular ring. Some rushed out through the open entrance, forcing everyone outside to duck, including Lisa and the Ghosts.</p><p>&quot;Lisa! Get the rest, I'll handle her.&quot; Kyle roared over the din of pellet fire, Lisa nodding and diverting her efforts toward the prison cells further down the hallway.</p><p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Yona mocked as she clenched both paper fans in her hands, directing the metal dust cloud back to form rings around her, manipulated by the continuous flow of air. Without warning she shot three bolts of the metal dust at Kyle, prompting him to roll and avoid the shredding blasts.</p><p>&quot;I'm sure.&quot; Kyle recovered into a crouching position, retrieving what seemed like a grenade and tossing it at her as hard as he could, the grenade shooting forward like a baseball pitch.</p><p>&quot;Idiot!&quot; Yona summoned her strength, charging the wind right at the grenade to knock it back. Instead, the cloud of metal dust shredded the exterior of the grenade, igniting its contents into a fiery ball that began to consume all of the metal dust, trails of fire converging toward Yona. With a quick flick, Yona forcibly expunged all the metal dust near her, preventing her from getting caught up in the growing explosion that also threatened to envelop Kyle. Seeing her chance, she quickly shot a gust of wind, pushing the explosion towards Kyle while she retreated back.</p><p>However, despite the push, the explosion suddenly split apart, an invisible barrier parting the flames and smoke around Kyle as if it were nothing. His barrier had also protected the still bleeding Dekar in the middle of the room from getting caught up in the explosion. Before Yona could utter any exclamation, Kyle was already in front of her, the barrier forcibly slamming her back into the nearest wall before she crumpled to the floor.</p><p>&quot;If we're done playing around, maybe we can get to business.&quot; Kyle adjusted his sleeves, walking up to Yona, who was struggling to get up, her leg fractured from the sudden hit. She desperately tried to swing her paper fans once more, but even her wind slices could not penetrate the barrier, harmlessly bouncing off as if she was merely pushing air around.</p><p>&quot;You... you are transcendent!&quot; Yona spluttered out with saliva and blood mixed in her spit, one of her lungs clearly collapsed as she tried to support herself against the wall. Kyle's eyes immediately narrowed, rushing forward to grab her by the neck and lifting her up, her broken leg dangling freely in the air, his barrier now warping around her.</p><p>&quot;How do you know about transcendents?&quot; Kyle questioned, but Yona only held a small grin as though she had won.</p><p>&quot;Too late, you touched me.&quot; She let out a small laugh, before a small light began to erupt from her chest, a familiar scene that Kyle had seen before in the hitman who had come to kill Gunther.</p><p><em>Won't work on me a second time.</em> Kyle already knew the best method to deal with it, slamming Yona down onto the ground and knocking her out cold. He ripped apart the clothes covering her chest, revealing a large engraving that was beginning to combust, her skin blackening from the flames that were trying to erupt.</p><p><em>Arcia Disruption!</em></p><p>Immediately, the flames began to sputter out, and the flow of arcia diverted through his Sub-Class skill. Instead, Yona's body began to flail violently as the arcia energy began to course backward into her own veins, her skin turning greenish and melting apart from the random effects. Acting quickly, Kyle hurriedly retrieved a copy of the Tattoo Knife from its holster on his belt, using it to disable the engraving directly by carving into her flesh, cutting through the runes directly, and making sure it was inoperable.</p><p>The slashing reduced her chest to an unrecognizable bloody mess, the loss of blood putting Yona on the brink of death. Yet instead of letting her die, Kyle grabbed a spare health potion vial from his pocket, pouring it all over the wound. The effects were immediate, with new skin growing over the old ripped-out strands, stabilizing her breathing.</p><p>Yet the mission was not done yet. Kyle quickly rose up to his feet, checking the progress of the battle outside the VIP room. Sasha and Feldon had already subdued most of the Nest guards, while Lisa and the Ghosts were rescuing Dekar's men and other slaves chained in the cells, no doubt being marked for sale to future owners. Kyle did a quick headcount of those he had seen, making up for about twenty people they'd rescued. &quot;Sasha, get in here. I need you to handle Yona. Tie her up and prepare for escape.&quot;</p><p>[Yes, sir] Sasha quickly entered the room, her outfit bloodied from the close combat that she had just gone through, some bits of flesh and strands of ears still visible on her shirt, though it hardly fazed her. She knelt next to Yona, stealing the uniform of another dead Nest guard and wrapping Yona in it.</p><p>At the same time, Kyle walked up to Dekar, whose breathing was still short and rapid, the battle having inflicted some minor wounds on him from the gusts of metal dust. Kyle fed him a health potion, giving him some comfort, though his eyes were fully locked on Kyle's face. &quot;What the fuck are you doing here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm back to have you honor the deal. You owe me a weapons factory.&quot; Kyle stretched out a hand, Dekar accepting it and pulling himself up to a standing posture.</p><p>&quot;I'm not the Minister anymore. My friend, Zayin-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. We've already got him and your men out. We need to move before the rest of Nest start coming in. We have a hideout nearby.&quot; Kyle began to move, but Dekar grabbed his arm.</p><p>&quot;No. Whatever hideout you have, it won't be good enough.&quot; Dekar shook his head. &quot;Follow me. I got a place not even Mornero knows about.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perfect. Let's move.&quot; Kyle agreed, ordering the rest of the Ghosts to evacuate. By this time, the Flirty Hole was the site of a terrible massacre. Lisa had to cup her mouth in horror, trying to stop herself from puking due to the sheer gore and human blood spilling across the dance floor, the bar's music still blasting as the rescued slaves and Dekar's men hobbled out through the entrance. Kyle and Sasha didn't care at all, simply stepping over the corpses of both innocent bystanders and Nest guards alike, focusing on making it out.</p><p>Dekar led the group, most of his wounds healed by the healing potion as he moved as quietly as possible, leading the entire group down the canals. As he reached a junction, he suddenly could hear shouting noises, the sounds of Nest reinforcements chasing after them. &quot;This way, quickly!&quot; Dekar urged, the group picking up the pace and following Dekar closely. They turned and twisted through the slowly narrowing canals until they reached a dead-end directly, with seemingly no path ahead.</p><p>&quot;Are you crazy, old man? What the fuck are you doing bringing us to our deaths?!&quot; Feldon shouted over the rushing water, but Dekar ignored him, instead sprinting up to the dead end and placing his hand on a yellow brick. The wall began to split apart, the bricks jostling aside like a magical tunnel, revealing a descending tunnel that led into an unknown shadowy realm.</p><p>&quot;Get in, now!&quot; Dekar whispered angrily before leaping in headfirst, Kyle following right after with the rest. The brick wall closed up behind them rapidly, leaving them in total darkness until Dekar tapped an arctech lantern, twisting a switch to light up the path. They all stood for a few seconds, catching their breath before finally hearing the pursuing Nest reinforcements approaching the wall.</p><p>&quot;Shit, they are com-&quot; Feldon panicked, but his mouth was immediately smothered by Kyle, who held a single finger up to his own mouth. Some specks of bright spotlights could be seen filtering through the gaps of the bricks as the Nest reinforcements tried to search for them.</p><p>&quot;Where the hell did they go? I swore they turned here!&quot; One of the Nest guards roared.</p><p>&quot;Check every nook and cranny. There must be a hidden place or hole!&quot; Another replied. &quot;You two, check further down that way and see if they ran further!&quot;</p><p>Kyle tapped Dekar's shoulder, motioning to him in silence to move forward. The group quietly tiptoed down the tunnel, careful not to attract any attention until they were sure they were out of earshot. Some of the rescued slaves began to grin widely, wanting to celebrate until they saw Kyle's stern face. &quot;No cheering until we're safe.&quot; He reminded them.</p><p>&quot;Didn't know the walls were retractable like that,&quot; Lisa muttered, though her face looked a bit listless, trying to reconcile the horrifying massacre that she had been a part of, unable to accept the senseless loss of life. Still, she kept a facade up, knowing that she was the leader of the Tenar rebel cell and had to act the part. <em>It's all for a good cause, it's all for a good cause...</em></p><p>&quot;Plenty of secrets in the catacombs. Johan and I are the only ones who know every single route in the catacombs. Maybe Zayin knows half of them.&quot; Dekar grinned at the limping Zayin, who didn't reciprocate.</p><p>They continued walking down the tunnel in silence, the ground clearly sloping deeper into another level of the catacombs beneath the canals. Soon, a bright light could be seen ahead at the end of the tunnel, revealing itself to be a large chamber filled with old rifles, maps, and some supplies that were collected by Dekar's men. Multiple tunnels served as exit and entry points into this central chamber, some of them leading to other smaller rooms. The group began to filter out into the large chamber, some of the rescued slaves staring at the vast ceiling and wondering how such a place could be hidden under Tenar.</p><p>While the rest began to settle down, resting to recover their stamina, Dekar's men finally began to realize that they did not recognize Lisa or the others, their suspicion raised even though they recognized them as their savior. One of Dekar's men walked up to Dekar, whispering quietly. &quot;If this is another ploy by Nest, we should get rid of them soon. We can't afford to trust others beyond who we know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll figure it out. Let me talk with their leader first before I know what's happening. He and I have dealt with each other before.&quot; Dekar nodded before waving at Kyle. &quot;Kris, please, come this way. Alone, if you could.&quot;</p><p>Kyle handed Yona over to Sasha as he left to follow Dekar.&quot;Have her prepared for interrogation in another room.&quot;</p><p>Kyle and Dekar walked through one of the shorter tunnels, reaching a similar hallway with three rooms, one of which seemed to act as Dekar's main lodging. &quot;Apologies for the mess, but it has been a long time since we've used this hideout.&quot; Dekar smiled as he arranged a few documents on an unkept table. The decor of the room clearly showed its age. Kyle noticed a few blurred paintings of the original revolutionaries in a group, along with crumpled banners and flags and a few old muskets stacked up along the side. A simple wooden bed with minimal cushion and no decorations was enough for Dekar.</p><p>Dekar closed the old, moldy wooden door behind them, turning to face Kyle properly while he crossed his arms. &quot;Firstly, thank you for saving us. But I think you owe me an explanation before we move forward with anything. Clearly, you are more than just a weapons designer. Who are you, exactly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who I am does not matter, it is what I can do for you that matters.&quot; Kyle sat down on the creaking bed calmly, unperturbed by the cramped room.</p><p>Dekar squinted his eyes. &quot;This is a matter of causes and beliefs. If we are not aligned, then there's no reason for us to cooperate.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't be so quick to dismiss a business proposition. Even if we have differing goals, the fact remains that both of us stand to benefit more if we work together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I still haven't heard what your goal is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's simple. Take down Harrison.&quot; Kyle stated clearly.</p><p>&quot;Take down Harrison...? Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The reasons are mine alone, but I have accumulated a significant network of rebels that are willing to fight against the current government, all of whom had suffered tremendously at the hands of sweeping policies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're lying.&quot; Dekar suddenly shot back in anger. &quot;I gave you a chance to come clean, and here you are still thinking I don't know anything. You think I don't know who you are? I've done my research when I was a Versian Minister - you're the leader of the Seven Snakes in Raktor.&quot;</p><p>To Dekar's astonishment, Kyle didn't show any sign of anger or surprise, merely staring at Dekar quietly. &quot;Do they know?&quot; Dekar pointed outside towards the door. &quot;I doubt those rebels are following you because you are a gang leader. For all I know, you could be a spy for Raktor. One working for Count Leon to sow discord amongst the Versian people as a prelude to war. With just one word, I could have them all turn against you. So you better tell me exactly what you're here for before I kill you myself.&quot;</p><p>Kyle clapped slowly, a small genial smile plastered on his face. &quot;Well done, Minister Dekar. You have me all figured out. All the cards are in your hands. But you're missing one thing.&quot; He rose to his full height, standing face-to-face with the indignant Dekar, who did not back down. &quot;Do you think you can kill me?&quot;</p><p><em>Intimidation Aura!</em></p><p>A sudden surge of pressure crushed down onto Dekar's shoulders, his muscles tensing as he suddenly felt shivers course through his body, the sight of Kyle now terrifying him to his bone. He gulped instinctively, trying to stand firm, but his legs were already beginning to wobble terribly while Kyle merely smirked.</p><p>&quot;Minister Dekar, or should I say, former Minister Dekar. I will help restore you to power if you agree to join our rebel movement and allow me to take over Harrison. If you do not agree...&quot; Kyle withdrew a Tattoo Knife. &quot;I'm afraid that I will have to take drastic measures to secure information. I'm sure you understand the dangers of running a rebel outfit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-you are utilizing the rebel movement just so you can get back at Harrison for a personal feud ?! Are you insane?&quot; Dekar's voice wavered, though he still had the courage to accuse Kyle. &quot;Even as a Yual dog, that's too mu-&quot;</p><p>Kyle lunged forward in an instant, grabbing Dekar's mouth and clamping it shut with an iron grip. &quot;I don't think you understand the gravity of this situation. No one crosses me and gets away with it scott-free. No one. Not even if I have to burn the whole of Tenar down to the ground. And as far as I can tell, you're toeing the line between asset and obstacle. Which one would you rather be? Friend or foe?&quot;</p><p>Dekar's eyes widened, before nodding his head vigorously, clearly indicating that he would like to be a friend. He gasped as Kyle let go of his mouth, breathing heavily.</p><p>&quot;Always a pleasure to talk with someone with a head on their shoulders. Hard to come by these days.&quot; Kyle returned to his original seat on the wooden bed, the intimidation aura dissipating and lifting the pressure off of Dekar. &quot;Now, the deal. You will be the figurehead of the rebel movement, and I will assist your endeavors to restore Versia to... whatever it was before.&quot;</p><p>Dekar rubbed his cheeks gingerly. &quot;To a free Versia. A great Versia, one ruled by the people, for the people.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A good slogan and an ideal for people to rally behind, yes.&quot; Kyle waved his hand dismissively. &quot;Though it is clear that whatever form of government comes next is hardly going to match.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When I promise a free Versia, it will be so.&quot; Dekar took offense at the insinuation.</p><p>&quot;There is another time for jokes, Minister Dekar, but for now, it's time to focus on the facts. Your former 'Versia' was neither free nor great.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How would a Yual dog know of such things? You live under the thumbs of your nobles directly, content to wallow in the mud while they enjoy the fruits of your labor. Even you as a gang leader have to pay taxes and tribute to them.&quot; Dekar shot back.</p><p>&quot;That may be so. Then please tell me, why did your 'free' and 'great' Versia crumble to such a shell of itself? You seem to be wallowing in the mud yourself.&quot; Kyle entertained him.</p><p>&quot;Because there was evil already lurking amidst us from the very beginning! Betrayed by our own brothers, that fucking snake Mornero and his lackeys twisted their hearts against the original cause for the sake of money and power...&quot; Dekar began to ramble. &quot;If only I had-&quot;</p><p>&quot;More power? More control? More authority to ensure that such evil would never rise again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I... I wouldn't put it that way...&quot; Dekar's voice faltered slightly.</p><p>&quot;Don't mask the answer from yourself - if you truly want a free and great Versia, someone has to step in and enforce it. The rule of law is only enforced through authority, and authority is enforced by force. Without a force great enough to restrain others, how can you be expected to ensure the liberties of others? Look, even your pitiful rebel outfit cannot maintain its original cause. You fumble and sneak about while your fellow Versians you swore to protect are enslaved by corrupt government officials and industrialists, trapped for years as you wax lyricals.&quot; Kyle sighed.</p><p>&quot;I had nothing when I was framed!&quot; Dekar roared in anger. &quot;I didn't have anything. If it weren't for my old allies helping me-&quot;</p><p>&quot;You would have been captured and jailed for the rest of your life under Harrison, forced to watch as his men bring Versia to the brink of collapse. Don't you see? I am the solution. With me on your side, you will have enough firepower, power and support from the people to fight back against the evil. All you have to do is promise me you'll stay out of the way when I deal with Harrison.&quot;</p><p><em>Just why is he so obsessed with Harrison?</em> Dekar wondered as he did not answer immediately. Despite Kyle's obvious overpowering physical capability, he wasn't one to cave to threats alone - the threats from the nobles didn't stop him from leading the charge during the independence war. What truly made him pause was Kyle's proposition. <em>I need his strength and power. He clearly has the ability to both arm and organize groups in a clandestine manner, to the point where I myself did not even know of their existence. Perhaps he is right: I can use him until I get back into a seat of power.</em></p><p>Yet something in Dekar's mind warned him that there was a hidden facet to the deal, though he shrugged it off. <em>As long as I don't fall into his trap, I will be able to corner him once I'm in power.</em> &quot;I accept your deal. My men will now join the Ghosts of Versia.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perfect. Pleasure doing business with you.&quot; Kyle shook Dekar's hand. &quot;However, if you do decide to renegade on the deal, know that your death will be long and painful.&quot;</p><p>Dekar kept a stern expression, not replying as he returned the handshake. As Kyle left the room, he found himself sweating buckets, as if he had just faced down a monster. <em>Have I just made a deal with the devil?</em></p><p>Kyle, on the other hand, was clearly satisfied with the progress of the rebel movement so far. With Minister Dekar now working for him, the Ghosts of Versia would gain some much-needed legitimacy. It also put them on the radar against Nest, as he had no doubt that such a raid would alarm them immediately and have them scouring the city. <em>Best to stay in this hideout, though we do need to find escape routes.</em></p><p>Not one to put all his eggs in a single basket, he began to examine the large chamber. It was clearly an ancient one, repurposed and last used during the original independence war. Rows upon rows of antiqued armor, ammunition, explosives, and rifles were stacked uselessly into piles carelessly collected in corners, while empty ration shelves were coated with dust accumulated over the years, only replaced by intermittent bags of groceries apparently acquired recently by Dekar's men. <em>Something to fix.</em></p><p>&quot;Hey, just exactly who are you guys?&quot; One of Dekar's men spotted Kyle examining the place, standing up to confront him. &quot;You might have saved us, but we're going to need some answers soon. We don't take too kindly to civilians playing with us, there's no time to handle kids acting like they are soldiers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Civilians...?&quot; Kyle cocked an eyebrow in confusion.</p><p>&quot;Yea, don't you know who we are? VSF commandos, all five. If we weren't captured by Nest, you wouldn't even see us.&quot; The commando puffed up his chest as his buddies began to congregate, nodding in agreement.</p><p>Kyle looked at them incredulously, before snorting in derision. &quot;You? You guys are Versian Special Forces? Don't make me laugh. All of you fell into a trap without even thinking for a second who was behind it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did you say? How about you and I -&quot; Before the commando could finish his challenge, a hand grabbed the back of his head from behind, tugging it backward in a furious flip that sent him sprawling onto the ground, crashing into the pile of rifles with a loud crash. His four comrades immediately raised their arms, ready to brawl, but they were too slow to block the punches aimed right at their guts, causing them to wheeze and gag one by one as they were taken down onto the floor.</p><p>As they struggled on the floor, they could only watch Sasha step over their bodies, dusting her hands off while Kyle sighed in the back. &quot;You can't even handle one civilian, and you expect to be able to handle Nest? Maybe if you get your head out of your ass, you'll be able to learn something from us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Grr... f-fuck! That wasn't fair!&quot; The first commando to be thrown scampered back onto his feet, his expression furious. &quot;Fight me head-on!&quot; He roared, slamming his chest and getting into a boxing posture.</p><p>Sasha stepped forward, but Kyle placed a hand on her shoulder, stopping her. &quot;Let others have some fun. Lisa, you're up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;H-huh?! Me?&quot; Lisa glanced around nervously, caught eating half a biscuit in her mouth while sitting against the wall.</p><p>&quot;When someone disrespects the Ghosts of Versia, the cell leader must be ready to defend their pride.&quot; Kyle motioned. &quot;He said you Ghosts are just playing around.&quot;</p><p>That was enough for Lisa, who shot right up, swallowing what was left of the biscuit in one chomp before storming up to the commando, who was already spitting bravado: &quot;Yea, come on, let me show you how strong the military really is!&quot;</p><p>Lisa didn't falter, raising her hands up just as Sasha had trained her over the last few weeks, the moves ingrained into her bones from the countless beatings and losses. Faced with the commando, Lisa felt close to no fear, knowing that he was no match even for Sasha. Her eyes burned with determination, sending a slight jolt of fear into the commando's heart for a brief moment, though he eventually laughed it off.</p><p>&quot;Trying to act tough? If you don't strike first, then I'll-&quot; The commando could not finish his words, forced to raise his elbow to block a fast right hook thrown by Lisa, before a sudden sharp pain could be felt on his knee, the cartilage tearing apart as Lisa's kick slammed the joint in a horrendous way, causing the commando to scream out in pain.</p><p>&quot;Couldn't even last five seconds.&quot; Lisa scoffed and shook her head in disappointment while the commando's four comrades rushed over to help him lie down. &quot;You think we're playing around? You are just military soldiers blindly following a man - but we are fighting for a future we believe in, and that every action and every plan executed will bring us closer to our goal. To us, you are the ones playing around, trying to bully others into submission just because you are stronger. Don't look down on us, punks.&quot; She tossed a health potion vial to the injured commando before walking back to Kyle and Sasha.</p><p>Sasha nodded in approval, giving a thumbs up, while Kyle held a satisfied smile on his face. &quot;Finally got over yourself?&quot; Kyle asked.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry for lashing out before at your plan. You're right - you've done more for the cause in one day than I have done in a week. So long as your plans and actions are for the cause, I will follow. For now. I'll keep the other Ghosts in line.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. Like I said, follow my orders, and we won't have a problem. You'll see your free Versia soon enough.&quot; Kyle shrugged. This was a good enough compromise for now - pushing too hard with a punishing hand would turn the rebels against him. He had to portray a show, as if he was simply a brutal man with a genuine cause aligned to them. <em>They don't need to know the full picture - no one does. I will just use them until they are no longer useful to me, or if they betray me. Everyone is replaceable.</em></p><p>While the injured commando continued to whimper in the corner, Kyle continued his tour of the chambers. There was plenty of space, with quite a few extra rooms that could house close to two hundred people overall, and there could be some avenues and areas that had some potential to be expanded with the proper support in place. Still, he didn't know which tunnel led where, until the commandos finally dropped their ego and answered Kyle faithfully. &quot;The tunnels in this layer help us to access different sectors of Tenar, and some eventually lead to other cities.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Other cities like Ocra?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes and Creuliz. Desham is a bit harder, there's no direct path as far as we know. According to Dekar and Johan, there should be one, but it is extremely perilous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perilous? As in, treacherous terrain?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, as in other animals and creatures. We aren't the only ones living at this depth in the catacombs.&quot; The commando explained.</p><p>&quot;Interesting...&quot; Kyle kept that in mind, but he focused on the main issues now, walking up to his Seven Snakes members. &quot;Sasha, Feldon. I need you to establish a proper route back to Ocra. We need to gather supplies, weapons, and additional help. If we can secure this supply route, it will be much easier. Anything that can't be solved, let me know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Feldon and Sasha nodded in unison, getting to work and leaving Kyle free to do what he truly needed to do. He entered the room where Yona was tied up in, Yona still unconscious from the hit. It was a simple bunk room with a few chairs and sleeping bags scattered about. She was tied up with ropes binding her arms and legs to the chair separately. Kyle walked around her, his hand pulling out the Tattoo Knife from his belt's holster, twirling it expertly.</p><p>&quot;I know you're awake. You got three seconds before I rip off one of your arms.&quot; Kyle warned, prompting Yona to finally open her eyes, a small grin on her face.</p><p>&quot;You won't. Not when I hold the information you so desperately need.&quot; Yona held a confident look. &quot;If you kill me-&quot;</p><p>A blinding slice faster than she could blink flashed past her, her brain slightly disorientated at what had just happened until she realized she couldn't breathe, her throat slit by the cold, sharp blade of the Tattoo Knife. <em>What?! He actually killed me?</em> Her eyes widened as the blood began to gush out of the inch-wide incision on her vocal cords, choking on her own blood as she toppled back over onto the floor, struggling to breathe while her body flailed wildly in a violent attempt to break free of her restraints.</p><p>She squirmed against the ropes to no avail, only able to roll over towards Kyle's feet, Kyle's eyes uncaring, simply watching her life fade away slowly bit by bit. Yona clenched her fist as she tried everything she could think of in a desperate attempt, arcing her body to try and flex the chair off, but her strength was rapidly fading, her vision narrowing over the seconds. <em>No... no... no! I can't die here, not like this!</em></p><p>&quot;Looks like you still want to live.&quot; Just before she was about to lose consciousness, Kyle kicked her squirming body over, forcing a healing potion right onto her throat wound. Within seconds, the wound healed, restoring her sliced throat and vocal cords and allowing Yona to breathe again, her lungs inhaling with a loud, sharp gasp.</p><p>&quot;Ready to talk? Or we can repeat this until you're satisfied.&quot; Kyle flicked the blood of the knife towards the ground, Yona's blood splattering on the ground. Yona didn't hesitate, this time nodding in agreement.</p><p>&quot;Good. First question - how do you know about transcendents?&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 108 - Interrogation</strong></p><p>&quot;You... you're not with them, are you?&quot; Yona squinted her eyes even while she was coated in her own blood, the streams from her throat drying up on the Nest guard uniform that draped around her ripped cheongsam.</p><p>&quot;Maybe, maybe not.&quot; Kyle played it off, but deep down his heart skipped a beat. It had been an assumption ever since he had been thrown into Raktor in the body of Alvin, yet right here was confirmation that he was truly still in the Galactic Era and that he wasn't the only one who knew about it. However, he needed to pry out more information from her - perhaps they had different definitions of what a 'transcendent' was.</p><p>&quot;Of course you're not with them - otherwise you would have never asked such a question. Please don't treat me like I'm dumb.&quot; Yona held a smug look, a futile attempt to act as if she had the upper hand in the interrogation in order to compensate for her near-death experience. Such was the way of life as a Nest leader - one had to act tough regardless of the scenario.</p><p>&quot;Answer the question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never in my life would I have expected to meet a rogue transcendent in the flesh. Usually they don't last long enough, but judging from your strength, you certainly found a way to evade their detection. Sooner or later they are going to find you and-&quot; Yona suddenly felt the knife's blade against her neck again, Kyle moving faster than she could react to.</p><p>&quot;Last chance.&quot; Kyle warned, before retracting the blade. &quot;You're the not the only one in Nest who knows - don't think you're irreplacable.&quot;</p><p>Yona gulped instinctively, her fake bravado finally collapsing entirely and prompting her to spill the beans. &quot;Transcendents are what the name suggests - humans who have transcended their boundaries.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like mages.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, but we both know you're not a mage, and I know you're not asking about mages. Transcendents are like gods among men, able to dominate anything they touch, seemingly invincible and possessing strength far beyond the common human.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How many have you met?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only one in person here in Versia.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is he still here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hard to say. The last time I met him was a year ago - he could be anywhere now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What was he in Versia for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wasn't the one in charge of him - he was handled by someone else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Harrison.&quot;</p><p>Kyle took a deep breath, sitting down on a chair and pondering his next moves. With this new information, tackling Harrison would be far more difficult than he expected. Harrison possessing Galactic Era technology was one thing, but another possible System user was a whole another thing. <em>I have to investigate this new connection between Harrison and this 'group' of transcendents as soon as possible, and ascertain just how far entrenched they are in Versia.</em></p><p>If Kyle could help it in anyway, he would rather not expose himself to any other System users - he knew for a fact that they would kill him on sight if they had the chance, no questions asked. He knew because he would do the same as well. Having someone with a similar power system as him was far too dangerous to both control and handle, unless he found a method to restraint such a user through relics or other Galactic Era technology.</p><p>On the other hand, if they were not System users, it would be equally dangerous: Galactic Era transcendents were basically super weapons, constituting about a billionth percent of the galactic human population. His criminal group in his former life had methods of dealing with such people, him even having assassinated one himself before, but he did not have access to any of his former technology. <em>I'll have to work harder then.</em></p><p>Still, there was more to get out of Yona. In order to regain his former strength, Harrison's Galactic Era arsenal of technology was what he needed to truly ensure victory against any other System users, assuming they had a similar start to him. &quot;You're a leader of Nest, so you must have information on what is Harrison's endgoal. What does he want?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; Yona shrugged. &quot;I just follow his orders - the motives behind the plan are a mystery to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then at least you know his movements. Where is he?&quot;</p><p>&quot;For now he's been travelling between the new military complex and the Versian Parliament. If you're planning to attack him, just know he's well protected - at least thirty men are guarding him at all times, not to mention the entire Nest information network. I suspect that when word of my capture returns to him, they would double security in both Tenar and the catacombs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I already expected that.&quot; Kyle rose to his feet, gripping the knife tightly and preparing to decapitate her. Yona's eyes widened as her brain raced to find a way out.</p><p>&quot;Wait, I told you what you wanted to know!&quot; Yona blurted out while Kyle continued to approach.</p><p>&quot;And I've heard enough. You're better to me dead than alive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, no I still have more to tell you! I-I could tell you the layout of the military complex, the patrol pattern of the guards! I can tell you where Harrison's office is too, and get you access in too!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And who's to say you won't sell us out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don't understand, Nest won't accept me back: without the self-immolation engraving, I'm considered compromised - protocol is to kill me on sight! Please, you have to let me live, I can't die just yet!&quot; Yona pleaded.</p><p>&quot;That's not good enough.&quot; Kyle walked forward, the knife aimed right at Yona's heart.</p><p>&quot;I... I can give information on all Nest sweatshops and all secret Nest smuggling tunnels. You need manpower, don't you? I can help provide the location of all of them, and even provide delivery timings!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's more like it.&quot; Kyle grinned, sheathing his knife. &quot;And if you do decide to betray us...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I won't - with the self-immolation engraving gone, Nest means nothing to me now.&quot; Yona nodded vigorously, though her shifty eyes already showed considerations for an escape plan.</p><p>&quot;We'll see about that.&quot; Kyle untied her from the chair, but kept her hands bound before dragging her out of the interrogation room back to the central chamber, where Sasha and Feldon were preparing to ascertain a resupply route to Ocra along with the other Ghosts. Dekar and his men were also in the middle, discussing their next steps together and organizing everyone.</p><p>After the talk with Kyle and display of strength, Dekar and his men had already reluctantly accepted the merger. However, it was clear that they were still working on their own procedures and timings, though Kyle did not care too much about that as long as they did their jobs in a competent manner. &quot;Sasha, Feldon, hold on. We have more information from her.&quot; Kyle put Yona front and center. &quot;She'll assist in getting us a resupply route and inform our next steps.&quot;</p><p>Sasha nodded, but Feldon, Lisa and Dekar clearly had their misgivings, everyone else in the central chamber staring at Yona with suspicion. &quot;Are we sure we can trust her? If her information is wrong we're all dead in the water!&quot; Lisa pointed out.</p><p>&quot;We're not going to trust her blindly - we'll carefully ascertain each detail of the information she gives us before we act. But with Dekar's understanding of the catacombs and Yona's knowledge of the Nest locations, we can begin to produce a complete map of the catacombs.&quot;</p><p>Dekar began pulling out old ancient schematics of the catacombs and laying them out on the floor in the central chamber, all members gathering around and listening in intently. &quot;There's a total of four layers to the catacombs - Nest is mostly concentrated in the 1st and second layer. They have been expanding it as well, so the maps I have here are not accurate either.&quot;</p><p>Yona looked taken aback at what Dekar had said. &quot;That's impossible, the catacombs only have two layers, everyone knows that. We swept the entire place from top to bottom with more than a thousand members.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And you still couldn't catch me.&quot; Dekar smirked.</p><p>&quot;I did when you came for Zayin.&quot; Yona taunted.</p><p>&quot;And look where that got you.&quot; Dekar grinned. &quot;Always a bigger dog in a dog-eat-dog world.&quot;</p><p>Yona was about to retort, before the gears started to turn in her mind, tracing the events that had happened and finally realizing the truth, her face aghast at Kyle. &quot;You. You planned all of this. That fucking Masir, the hideout explosion, the information leak of Zayin's location, and the tracking back... It was you!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So I did. Now focus at the task at hand.&quot; Kyle waved his hand dismissively. &quot;Four layers to the catacomb - which layer are we in now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right now we're in the third. Only the original revolutionaries know about this third layer, because we discovered it ourselves. Clearly Nest has no clue about it, but I'm certain with Yona's disappearance, they may eventually discover us.&quot; Dekar began to combine the maps together, forming an incomplete drawing of all three layers.</p><p>&quot;Can we move deeper? What about the fourth layer you mentioned?&quot; Feldon asked.</p><p>&quot;The fourth layer is far too dangerous. Nobody we've sent during the independence war had ever returned, so even that is a black box to us.&quot; Dekar shook his head. &quot;The current rumor is that it is a ruin of sorts, but its teeming with monsters and creatures that would take far too much effort to clear. Not even the treasure hunters dare to attempt it, not that most of them are even aware of its existence.&quot;</p><p>Kyle was already aware of this from what Dekar's men had mentioned before, but still it intrigued him greatly. <em>This must be a Galactic Era ruin - and if Nest doesn't know about it, Harrison doesn't either. This could be my chance to get a leg up on him without having to attack him directly.</em> Already his efforts into this rebel movements was providing returns far beyond what he could obtain in Raktor. &quot;Do we know where the entrances are?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We do, but its way too dangerous. Anyone that enters never makes it out!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Doesn't matter - mark them out. Let's get that combined map drawn out now.&quot;</p><p>Over the next three hours, they worked together to trace out the different known layers, the maze of the catacomb slowly coming into shape with marks indicating Nest presences and slave factories. Even Yona was astounded at the sheer scale of the third layer, which seemed to be even more expansive than the first and the second layer combined, which Dekar knew like the back of his hand.</p><p>&quot;Who else knows about the third layer?&quot; Kyle asked while they continued marking hotspots.</p><p>&quot;The original revolutionaries. Johan and I know the most.&quot;</p><p><em>President Johan... he was the former Versian president before he took over.</em> &quot;Where is he?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have no idea, but he was reported missing on a tour around the Versian border.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He's captured by Mornero.&quot; Yona answered directly. &quot;I know, because I captured him personally.&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Dekar shouted in a sudden rage, glaring at Yona as he grabbed her by the shoulders, raising a fist ready to punch her. &quot;You fucking kidnapped the Versian president? Are you out of your fucking mind?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can kill me all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. We're a mercenary organization - we work for the highest bidder.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You...&quot; Dekar bristled with fury, but he calmed himself down, returning back to his cartography tasks. &quot;When all this is over, you're going to rot in a cell for decades.&quot;</p><p>Yona didn't reply, but she clearly was not planning to go easily. Kyle hardly gave two shits about their internal conflicts, only focusing on the map. With the entire layout now planned out, it was obvious which tunnels they could use for the resupply towards Ocra. &quot;These three tunnels are our targets for now. If we can secure them and protect them against detection by Nest, then we should be able to maintain a proper logistical chain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's assuming we don't get stopped when we reach topside.&quot; Feldon pointed out. Our wagons still need to get into Ocra.</p><p>&quot;Find a solution. I don't care how you do it as long as you keep it clandestine. Work with Sasha to control the route.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Understood.&quot; Feldon and Sasha both picked up a backpack of supplies each which they had prepared before, one of Dekar's men leading them out of the hideout.</p><p>&quot;Dekar, you and I are going to find a way into the fourth layer. Lisa, I need you train and organize the rescued slaves. Teach them what it means to be a Ghost. Anyone who refuses to fight, relegate them to logisitical support. Make sure Yona doesn't get any chance to communicate outside, lock her in a separate room.&quot; Kyle issued his orders one by one.</p><p>&quot;No, no, no I'm not going there again. No way in hell. Not even if the Goddess herself came down and asked me to.&quot; Dekar shook his head vigorously.</p><p>&quot;It's only a matter of time before Nest finds us - the fourth layer will help us serve as a backup escape path should we be cornered.&quot; Kyle explained. &quot;Based on the entrances of the fourth layer, it would also help us to traverse the third layer far quicker if we can find a pathway through.&quot;</p><p>Dekar couldn't argue against Kyle as their perlious escape from Nest had the Nest guards now swarming the catacombs looking for them. Without a secondary escape plan other than running to another city, it would be foolish to simply stand still and hope for the best. &quot;Alright. I'll get my men ready for it.&quot;</p><p>Within an hour, Kyle, Dekar and his commando squad were geared up, armed to the teeth. Kyle himself brought a briefcase, as well as gearing up with a smuggled Aspis MK1 Knight Armour, his Oriental Bloom handgun, the Tattoo Knife and a Seven Snakes repeater rifle, courtesy of Lisa's supplies. They left through a different tunnel, one that seemed to lead outwards to the wider main zone of the third layer.</p><p>Unlike the largely sterile and man-made structures of the first and second layer, the third layer was beginning to look more like a natural cave of sorts, though the paved paths along the waterways were clearly artifical, laid by the predecessors from eons ago. Countless glowing mushrooms provided a significant amount of ambient light as waste energy, seemingly part of their conversion process. Kyle could already feel a denser concentration of arcite ore, much like the depths of the Culdao Peaks.</p><p>Radioactive sludge and large scurrying rats avoided the bright beams of concentrated arctech lanterns, their beams narrowed by makeshift apertures held by Dekar's commando squad leading the way. Despite their apparent weakness against Sasha and Kyle, it was clear that they still had a significant advantage in professionalism and experience, expertly checking every nook and cranny, every turn and corner for potential enemies.</p><p>Kyle had the map memorized already, at least for the vicinity of the hideout, and could still figure out where he was. Yet as he trudged along with the rest, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching him intently from the sides. He spun his head around sharply, trying to catch him, but instead he only heard the scurrying of something large moving away from him, rock tapping against stone rapidly. <em>Looks like they weren't wrong about creatures.</em></p><p>Dekar led the group towards a door that was half collapsed, grunting as he shifted the fallen rubble out of the way to clear the entrance. The commandos entered gingerly, their lanterns flashing across the expansive burial chamber which had rows upon rows of buried humans, all still mummified in their elegant coffins stacked in carved out stone shelves, accompanied by urns that used to be filled with jewelry, priceless antiques and precious metals. However, as Kyle peered closer, it was apparent that all of them had been plundered a long time ago.</p><p>&quot;I thought only the original revolutionaries knew about this place. How is this place already wiped clean?&quot; Kyle remarked, picking up one of the ancient urns and examining it. The ancient Versian language was indecipherable to him, but thankfully his System was there to assist.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Ancient Versian Urn</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Perfect for a fetish</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The surface depicts a goddess descending from the heavens in a fiery chariot. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p>&quot;How did you think we found the funds to fight back against the nobles?&quot; Dekar gave a knowing smile as he approached the end of the burial chamber, pushing aside a large circular stone and revealing a circular hole that led to an equally ancient hideout designed similar the one Kyle had seen previously, except that it was clearly unused for decades and far larger, nearly triple in size. Unlike the previous one, this hideout had already been cleaned out of any supplies and weapons, with almost no furnishing left.</p><p>Dekar continued to lead them through the maze-like hallways, rows upon rows of abandoned bunks and storage rooms abandoned, before coming to a room that once housed an arctech engine that powered the entire base, a broken arcia etcher left lying on the dusty floor while a clear square mark indicated where the engine used to sit.</p><p>&quot;It was only nearer the end of the war where we found a tunnel that led deeper in, right here.&quot; Dekar pointed to the very end of the engine room, a locked metal door that was bolted tightly. &quot;No one entered through here before, but it definitely leads straight down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why did you not explore it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;At the time we couldn't afford to lose manpower to a futile attempts. We had already sent multiple exploration squads through another entrance far further along the third layer, but like I said, no one came back. It would be stupid to continuously throw members to their deaths when we were fighting a losing war with the nobles.&quot; Dekar explained as he checked the metal lock. &quot;Shit. We're missing the key. Spread out and check the rest of the base-&quot;</p><p>Kyle took his Tattoo Knife out from its holster, slicing through the lock like it was made of liquid, the two halves clattering to the ground uselessly. The metal door creaked open slowly, a gust of wind from within pushing it out slightly as Dekar's commando squad was on high alert, their barrels aimed right at the door. The tunnel behind the metal door was rugged and cramped, only able to fit one human at a time at full height.</p><p>&quot;Alright, we found the entrance, so we can head back now-&quot; Dekar acted oblivious, turning to leave when Kyle grabbed him by the shoulder.</p><p>&quot;This isn't enough. We still need to make sure there is a pathway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you want to commit suicide, please don't drag me into this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're just going to scout to figure out what we're dealing with. At the first sign of danger, we're running back. You two, you're coming with us. The rest of you guard the tunnel and set up camp.&quot; Kyle ordered. The commandos looked at each other uneasily, before looking at Dekar.</p><p>Dekar sighed, finally accepting what he needed to do. &quot;Do it. We'll be back soon. I got a feeling we'll be running back in five minutes.&quot;</p><p>Kyle didn't enter the tunnel first, having one of the commandos enter first before following in. They moved as a unit, everyone keeping their eyes peeled for any potential traps. &quot;Stay within a meter of me at all times.&quot; Kyle spoke quietly while he kept focused, looking for any signs of a Galactic Era trap - pressure plates, quasar shredders or radioactive emitters that could melt a human were all a possibility, though he was confident that he could deal with it with his System Skills. <em>Everything except Intimidation Aura and Arcia Disruption is available. This is My Turf would be the only useful one against such a trap - I wouldn't be able to intimidate an automated defense system either way.</em></p><p>As they continued to descend, the rush of air seemed to get stronger and stronger, a strange occurrence for a tunnel at such a depth. &quot;Weird... there should be less air as we get deeper. Why is there more?&quot; Dekar muttered while he kept close to Kyle from behind. Soon, within a short five minutes, the tunnel suddenly opened up around the bend, expanding into a large rectangular tunnel that was wide enough to fit a wagon. Instead of the standard brick-and-mortar that had been consistent throughout the entire catacombs, the walls here were instead made of a dense green stone, half covered in glowing algae that gave a eerie blue glow, accented by the intermittent green crystals embedded in the ceiling glittering like stars.</p><p>&quot;By the Goddess...&quot; Dekar whispered, while his commando squad let out hushed sounds of amazement at the scope of the tunnel. Kyle walked up carefully to the nearest wall, noticing intricate decorations in the form of carvings that extended the entire length. The rectangular tunnel seemed to extend indefinitely, its end barely visible in the distance.</p><p>&quot;Assuming my sense of direction is correct, we should be facing the other known entrance of the fourth layer.&quot; One of the commandos mentioned, trying to recall the layout. &quot;If this pathway can move twenty kilometers straight, it would be perfect for our uses.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm, you're right.&quot; Dekar pondered, trying to orient himself according to a 3D imagination of the catacombs. &quot;That's if the pathway isn't dangerous.&quot;</p><p>Kyle noticed a metallic glint at the base of the wall, squatting closer while using his Tattoo knife to shift the glowing algae moss aside, revealing a light-emitting diode strip that had been entrenched into the tunnel. <em>So this really is a Galactic Era ruin.</em> However, unlike the Oracle Chambers, he did not receive any notification whatsoever, which made him wonder if this ruin was related to his System at all.</p><p>He grabbed an arctech lantern, shining it deeper towards the end of the tunnel. The moment the focused beam shot towards the distance, Kyle noticed a speck of black moving across the width of the tunnel much further down, the same skittering that he heard trailing him on the third layer starting to get closer. &quot;Get your weapons ready, and prepare to run&quot; Kyle quickly ordered.</p><p>&quot;What the hell is that sound?&quot; The commandos swivelled their heads around, pacing back towards the cramped tunnel entrance from which they came from. As the four of them stared into the horizon, a growing swarm of squirming legs began to surge towards them, a mass of movement charging right at them at alarming speed, the exact details unperceivable through the dim ambient light that were slowly blocked out one by one.</p><p>&quot;RETREAT!&quot; Dekar roared, spinning on his heels to run back to the cramped tunnel entrance, only for the cramped tunnel entrance to suddenly collapse on itself due to the sheer tremors created by the incoming swarm. The two commandos didn't hold back any longer, firing into whatever was charging at them while backpedaling. Instead of the pellets finding flesh, they ricocheted off what seemed to be hard rock, bouncing off the tunnels.</p><p>Kyle hurriedly tossed his repeater rifle to the nearby commando: &quot;Use it and cover me! You, go help Dekar clear the damn rubble out!&quot; The commando caught the repeater and hurriedly fired it, finding far more success as the pellets elicited sharp shrieks of pain and guttural growls, stemming the swarm a little.</p><p>While the two commandoes got into action, Kyle cracked open his briefcase, revealing a metallic exosuit arm that he wore in one swift motion onto his right, the fingers and grooves fitting neatly onto his shoulder.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Custom Prototype Exosuit Arm (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>From the moment flesh's weakness was revealed, disgust reigned</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> +150 STR. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>[Active] Strength Infusion</strong>: Provides user with immense strength on arm. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 MP per minute.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle activated the arm, the engravings all glowing up as it snaked through the metallic frames stemming from each of skin pores, the strength flooding into his arm as he clenched and relaxed his fist a few times. He grabbed the Tattoo knife in the armored first, while his left gripped the Oriental Bloom handgun, ready to fight.</p><p>&quot;Shit, here they come!&quot; The commando using the Seven Snakes repeater hollered, Kyle standing up and preparing to fight. It was only at this close distance that he could begin to make out what creature was actually attacking them, but before he could get a good look, one of them lunged towards him with a piercing shriek that almost deafen him, two spiky rocks aimed right at his head.</p><p><em>Penchant for Violence!</em> Kyle's body grew even lighter, his stats doubling on top of the strength bonus provided by his new exosuit arm. Power surged through his veins as he deftly dodged the two incoming strikes, pivoting on his feet while the exosuit arm whirred with a unique hum, allowing him to plunge the Tattoo Knife into the owner of the two spiky rocks. The tip of the jagged knife pierced a hard rocky armor, cracking it apart to reveal a squishy black flesh that ruptured easily the moment the knife touched it, shredding it like butter.</p><p>Kyle swerved his head to the side as another rock spike shot towards his head, gritting his teeth and plunging the knife even deeper into the flesh as hard as he could. With a roar, Kyle channeled his arcia energy into the exosuit arm, using raw power to drag the knife along the insides, tearing apart the flesh from within and cutting the creature in half. It collapsed with a trailing cry, the spiky rocks collapsing to the floor as well as with a torrent of icky bodily fluids gushing out and smothering the glowing algae along the floor.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Rock Spider, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Initiated</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The young seek their next meal. <strong>Survive</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Trial?</em></p><p>&quot;What the actual fuck is that?&quot; The commando yelled as he continued shooting, taking out other rock spiders that continue to charge forward. Each of them was the size of a wild boar and featured eight sharpened rock spikes for legs, while their central body was a perfect sphere of hardened rock armor which a normal rifle could not penetrate. A sizable circular opening the size of a plate exposed their internal flesh in the central body, from which a tentacle, worm-like mouth filled with rows upon rows of mandibles acted like another limb, jabbing at Kyle while he chopped off any that approached. There were nearly two dozen of them blocking the tunnel, the commando having killed a few off and blocking their path slightly as the rest clambered over the corpses of their dead bretheren.</p><p>Despite the toughness of the armor, Kyle's exosuit arm afforded him the strength to simply plunge the knife headfirst into the mouth of the spider while his left hand fired the handgun with precision, the powerful pellets maiming legs and tearing into the armor. He rushed at another rock spider, cutting through the central sphere like cake with his Tattoo Knife, resulting in another fountain of bodily fluids that spluttered onto Kyle's, the black icky goo viscous.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Rock Spider, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p>With no time to waste, Kyle sliced and jabbed as hard as he could, killing a few other rock spiders before his Penchant of Violence's duration expired. Soon, his body suddenly felt heavier, the energy he had lost, but Kyle now focused on the weak points of the rock spiders, aiming for their mouths. His Oriental Bloom handgun began to run out of pellets, and the commando was also forced to reload, pouring more pellets into the multiple canisters from his own.</p><p>Kyle didn't let a single rock spider get pass him, using his exosuit arm to carve them up one by one while making sure the commando wasn't in danger of being attacked. Soon, all two dozen of the rock spiders were dead on the ground, some of their bodies still twitching slightly. Amdist the black goo that coated everything in range, Kyle noticed a small speck of something familiar, keeping his exosuit arm at the ready to stab anything that was still alive while reaching out cautiously. His hand dug through the soft flesh, before tugging out a tiny coin-sized crystal, similar to what his Necklace of Healing had.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Poor Arcia Crystal (Basic)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Better than an arcite ore, but filled with impurities.</em> </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle's mind raced as he absorbed the implications of what this meant. <em>This rock spiders are a walking mine!</em> Still, it was no time to figure out how to make money from it - already Kyle could hear countless screams and shrieks in the distance, other rock spiders swarming towards the disturbance. &quot;Dekar, how long more?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Al-almost done!&quot; Dekar huffed and panted, clearly unable to shift some of the larger pieces of rubble that blocked the exit. Kyle didn't waste any more time, sprinting up to them and using his exosuit arm to easily tear apart the rubble, his punch crushing the rubble into smithereens.</p><p>&quot;Get up! NOW!&quot; Kyle roared, motioning for them to quickly scampered up around the rubble, Kyle taking up the rear. The moment everyone was clear of the large rectangular tunnel, Kyle followed them up, but not before digging the fingers of his armoured exosuit arm, pulling out a chunk of the supporting wall and partially collapsing the cramped tunnel behind him. He could hear the charging rock spiders slam into the collapsed pile of rubble that now blocked them, their shrieks endless in a chaotic cacophony.</p><p>Dekar let out a huge sigh of relief the moment they reached the top, ordering the other commandos who were guarding the engine room to barricade the metal door as soon as Kyle came up. They hauled bedframes and old wooden cupboards, boarding up the metal door with anything and everything they could find to make sure the rock spiders didn't come up.</p><p>Kyle ignored the stares of horror from the commandos at his clearly stained armour and clothing, coated in the black icky goo from the rock spiders. Instead, he was far more focused on the arcia crystal in his hand. <em>If this works just like my Necklace of Healing, then we have a way to create far more compact fuel packs.</em> Arcia consumption had always been one of the biggest issues that his men faced, and with his rebel movement being on a tight deadline, such portable crystals could act as compact batteries and supplement the weak arcia supply that the rebels and recruited slaves will have.</p><p>Even more interesting was the Trial System Message that he had received, a clear indication that his System was related to the ruin. &quot;Dekar, prepare to move the hideout to here. This base will be our main command center.&quot;</p><p>Dekar stared at Kyle as if he had just heard the stupidest thing ever. &quot;You're crazy. You nearly died to a carnivorous swarm of rock spiders and you want US to MOVE? HERE?&quot;</p><p>&quot;With great danger comes great rewards.&quot; Kyle tossed the collected arcia crystal to Dekar, the latter fumbling the crystal in his hand. &quot;And I intend to get what I deserve.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 109 - Dungeon Exploration</strong></p><p>As soon as Kyle got back to Dekar's original hideout, the entire plan previously discussed kicked into action. Over the next three days, they worked together to port all of their supplies and equipment over to the abandoned hideout, slowly refurbishing it over time. The arctech engine room was fortified, Kyle ordering the creation of tiered defenses should the original entrance tunnel fail to hold the rock spiders at bay. Even though the rock spiders were supposedly part of the 'Trial' his system suggested, it was not beyond the realm of possibility for a swarm to attempt breaching the hideout.</p><p>While he had been working on organizing the forces, Sasha and Feldon had managed to utilize one of the old tunnels to great effect, establishing a proper link with Ocra. With the connection completed, Kyle could now requisition additional tools and personnel over. A dozen more trained Ghosts were sent over, helping to bolster the force even more alongside regular rations and arctech machinery to enable Kyle to perform basic modifications. Antidotes, potions, gas masks, and armor were also brought over, giving them some much-needed equipment for him to explore the dungeon later, one that he inherently expected to be dangerous. <em>If I had an exosuit I would use it.</em></p><p>Throughout this entire process, Lisa took charge of helping and training the new slaves into useful assets. Unsurprisingly, many of them did not want to join the frontlines and be a rebel, but were open to the idea of contributing in the backlines. Feldon and Lisa worked together to instruct them properly, acting as resupply crews and mules to pick up smuggled goods and scout other old tunnels to serve as backup connections. They were put to use in expanding and excavating the old hideouts as well as improving the living and storage space.</p><p>&quot;For now, we know that he intends to invite delegates from other countries around the continent. I suspect it's a ploy aimed at preventing Count Leon from attacking too early.&quot; Minister Dekar explained his understanding of the situation. &quot;With so many foreign diplomats in the city, it would be devastating to both Count Leon and the Yual Dominion's reputation if they were to strike first or even perform any military action.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Current information suggests that Count Leon is attending the exhibition as well...&quot; Kyle found this sudden exhibition unnatural compared to the previous progress expected. It was apparent from all of his dealings with the black market and Count Leon that a war was imminent. &quot;Perhaps Harrison is intending to delay the inevitable, hoping to buy more time for preparation.&quot; He muttered to himself, trying to nail the motives of all parties involved.</p><p>There was no question that the military exercise would be the best time for Count Leon to launch a first strike and catch Versia off-guard in a blitz. If Kyle was in the same position, he would have launched an attack as soon as his troops were organized without hesitation. The fact that Count Leon was waiting this long spoke of a different plan. <em>Or maybe he recognizes the potential of Harrison's technology to be far stronger than expected, or Harrison has leverage.</em></p><p>Yona was still working on writing out the military-industrial complex, an effort that would not be done so soon. With only three weeks left till the exhibition, Kyle needed clear information on Harrison's whereabouts, as well as a surefire method to infiltrate and perform proper espionage. He didn't like being left in the dark, and he was already beginning to prepare for a potential all-out conflict should he be unable to gleam anything about Harrison's plan.</p><p>In order to have an all-out conflict, they needed to recruit more willing rebels and manpower to sustain any efforts to destabilize Harrison. Kyle knew that the people enslaved in Nest sweatshops on the first layer and the second layer were prime sources of bodies, but attacking them would raise the heat much higher and potentially cause a brutal crackdown. The Ghosts under Kyle were certainly not in a position to be able to handle such an event, not without thorough planning.</p><p>Kyle focused his efforts now on exploring the dungeon, a critical escape route that would be necessary should Nest breach the third layer. He rubbed his temples as he inspected the equipment that the Ghosts now had, checking its quality to ensure that the exploration would be successful. Already, it was clear that the antique rifles had to be replaced by freshly smuggled Seven Snakes repeater rifles that could penetrate the rock spiders' armor. However, he was looking for a more concrete upgrade to the firepower - rock spiders might not be the only heavily armored creatures lurking in the depths.</p><p>The main limiting factor was the arcia reservoir in each of his Ghosts. Even the commando under Dekar's command, who had utilized Kyle's repeater rifle, was suffering from arcia exhaustion, unable to fire all four canisters in one go without collapsing. It went without saying that recently converted refugees and slaves would not have the same competency and reservoir size compared to well-trained Seven Snakes associates who had spent time in an arcia training cave.</p><p>A solution was to obtain fuel packs, but smuggling such devices was both clunky and dangerous as well - any bust would mean a huge loss. Instead, Kyle had a hunch that the poor quality arcia crystal he had plucked from the remains of a rock spider could potentially alleviate the consumption strains on a user if embedded correctly on the repeater. <em>It should act exactly like a battery, the question is how?</em></p><p>Thankfully, Kyle was already well-read on the engravings used in a fuel pack, though he also got a hold of an old fuel pack they found lying about in the hideout as a reference. <em>The engravings here show an extraction method in order to filter arcia energy out of arcite ore... it should be simple enough.</em></p><p>Taking small steps at a time, Kyle set up a simple workbench in a small room: a smuggled arcia etcher with a few scrap metal plates that could serve as a prototyping board. He practiced his movements by drawing with a pencil on paper first a few times before using the etcher to engrave onto the scrap metal plate bit by bit, leaving a tiny notch for the poor-quality arcia crystal to be placed inside.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Prototype Crystal Extraction Engraving (Advanced)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Provides 2 MP per second for 10 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The result was slightly disappointing, but not unexpected. Energy could only be compressed so much, and while Kyle would have preferred to have an energy source equivalent to an arcia fuel pack, it was enough to fire the Seven Snakes repeater rifle for two canisters worth. <em>That's about two hundred pellets if we're going at full burst and without using internal arcia energy.</em> 20 MP was not much to Kyle, but it was significant to untrained soldiers. While it might limit their future training potential with the crystal serving as a clutch of sorts, the timelines were far too tight to worry about that - he needed firepower right now.</p><p>Taking his own repeater rifle and modifying it over the next few hours, he soon managed to embed the poor arcia crystal into a nice little slot that could be capped by a metal cover, preventing it from falling out during combat movements. <em>Considering this is the Aspis MK1... perhaps it is a MK2.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Rifled Aspis MK2 Repeater (Advanced)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle noted the ability to overcharge the shots, fulfilling his need to achieve firepower that could break through stronger armored creatures should they appear. With the modification done, Kyle began to modify other smuggled Seven Snakes repeaters, making sure they all had a slot for the crystals. To make the process faster, he filtered through the rescued slaves, finding a few who had competent hands and assigning them etching roles, where they followed a guiding example to the letter.</p><p>Soon, over a day, Kyle had five MK2 repeaters ready to go, along with adequate amounts of pellets necessary to sustain a prolonged conflict thanks to Feldon's smuggling. Kyle arranged for his squad to delve deeper into the dungeon, bringing along Sasha and three of Dekar's commando men towards the barricade entrance once again, this time with supplies enough to last a week. &quot;Feldon, you're in charge here. I brought you from Culdao Peaks for a reason - don't let me down. Work with Lisa to get everything in order.&quot; Kyle informed Feldon while the squad geared up, handing control of the hideout over to him.</p><p>&quot;You can count on me boss, I won't let you down!&quot; Feldon gave a wonky salute, causing Kyle to sigh and enter the cramped, collapsed tunnel once again. Kyle never told Feldon that the only reason why he was chosen for this operation was because he was the most expendable in the Seven Snakes, having no assigned role of importance, unlike Damian, Keith, and Niko. <em>Better to let him believe he is important - easier that way.</em></p><p>As they reached the base of the tunnel, they were met with a dead-end, filled with rubble caused by Kyle's destruction of the tunnel's support. &quot;Wait, we should have gotten some others to come here and dig it out. It's going to take us ages!&quot; One of the commandos complained.</p><p>&quot;Sasha, cut away the rubble, but don't collapse the support,&quot; Kyle spoke as if it was possible, the commandos sharing glances of confusion.</p><p>[Understood.] Sasha stepped up to the pile of rubble, slinging the MK2 repeater behind her back and unsheathing her runic falchion. &lt; Shue, Yul, Uryag, Nemoon &gt; She spoke once again with her eyes closed, her tone demure and silky smooth, the engravings that glittered with Dzi Flower Sand lighting up along the length with a furious brilliance, the blade shuddering violently in a rapid vibration. Her eyes flew open, her movements slashing the pile four times, the vibrating blade shredding apart the rubble. Each step saw Sasha carve a path out, her movements precise to ensure the rest of the tunnel did not collapse, as if she were a surgeon.</p><p>The three commandos could hardly believe their eyes, though their training kept them firm and steady, MK2 repeaters aimed towards the end of the tunnel. The moment Sasha broke out back into the large rectangular corridor, the three commandos filtered out quickly, checking the surroundings. Instead of seeing a pile of decaying rock spider corpses, the corridor was clean, only stains of black icky goo on the wall remaining as a sign of their battle days before. Kyle cautiously paced his steps, checking every detail until Sasha called for his attention. [Sir, take a look at this.]</p><p>Kyle saw Sasha squatted over a trail of black icky goo, interspersed by what seemed to be webbed footprints left. &quot;So the rock spider isn't the only thing we have to worry about...&quot; Kyle motioned for the rest of the squad to come over, seeing if anyone recognized it.</p><p>&quot;Looks like a salamander's tracks. There's quite a number of them roaming the catacombs, though I don't think I've ever seen one that big before...&quot; A commando pointed out, trying to get a sense of scale. &quot;It would be about the size of a tree trunk to match such a footprint.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And it most likely ate what remained of the rock spiders,&quot; Kyle concluded, standing back up. &quot;Check your gear - the moment we see such a predator, we retreat this way. Set up the arctech lanterns.&quot;</p><p>The squad got to work, attaching and hooking arctech lanterns up that lit up the corridor as they went, providing a brightly illuminated path back if they needed to beat a hasty retreat. Surprisingly, even as they walked forward for what seemed to be ten minutes, there were no signs of any rock spider swarms nor humongous salamanders either, the place eerily silent save for the small trickling of water that seeped through a few cracks, plopping onto the bioluminescent algae that were ubiquitous throughout the area. It was only until Kyle unknowingly stepped across the line that a system message popped up for him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Cleared</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The young have retreated to their abode. +5000 EXP awarded.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Noxious Depths of Tenar</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Level Recommended: 25 - 40. Penalty applied beyond recommended level range.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>What?</em> Kyle rubbed his eyes a little, wondering what the hell he was reading. <em>The trial gave me enough EXP to level up, even though I left the area for a few days. And this is the first time I've seen the dungeon's name.</em> It was also his first encounter with a recommended level. As far as he knew, his level had never really mattered, and it still didn't. However, the system message had now given him two hints.</p><p>First, the recommended level implied that there would be challenges, trials and creatures that a level 40 would find appropriate - a bad sign for Kyle's current level. Secondly, the name 'Noxious Depths of Tenar' implied a theme of poison, something he was not entirely prepared for. In an instant he held up his hand, clenching his fist tight and prompting the squad to come to a halt. &quot;Everyone, gas masks on, now.&quot;</p><p>The squad didn't argue, especially the commandos who were now utterly convinced of Kyle's superiority in combat. Dekar's warning of no one ever escaping the fourth layer had been broken by their previous success, but the three commandos knew it was only because of Kyle that they got out alive. Sasha too clamped a gas mask on her face, her breath intermittently fogging up the visor as they continued onwards.</p><p>As they continued down the corridor, still setting up arctech lanterns at intermediate intervals, a strange mist was coalescing on the floor, clearly heavier than air but not pushing towards them. Kyle didn't move any further the moment they spotted it, instead taking a single pellet from a canister and rolling it across the floor towards the mist, a tactic learned well in his time during the Galactic Era.</p><p>Instead of the pellet disintegrating as expected, the mist didn't seem to do anything to the pellet, seemingly inert. The squad rolled a few more pellets forward, using their arctech lanterns to try to spot any cracks above that could result in an ambush of sorts. Once they were satisfied, they moved ahead slowly, each step measured and cautious, Kyle keeping a keen eye out for any artificial traps. <em>Good thing I brought the gas masks and antidotes.</em></p><p>It took another ten minutes before they were now ankle deep in the mist, the tension amidst the squad still as high as ever as they continuously checked every nook and cranny for possible angles of attack. Weariness began to seep into their bones, their minds unable to keep up for much longer at this rate, the situation nerve-racking. &quot;Stay within a meter of me.&quot; Kyle ordered, counting on his skill to negate any possible attacks.</p><p>Moving as a tight unit, it wasn't long until they finally saw the end of the corridor, the sound of dropping sludge prominent above their own breaths in the gas masks. Smaller tiny insects and lizards scampered away from their armoured boots as they stepped towards the end, Sasha and the commandos faces dumbfounded from what they saw.</p><p>The corridor had led to a vast cavern in which none of them could even see the end of, filled to the brim with pillars upon pillars of refuse, sludge, sewage, and whatever waste Tenar had accumulated over hundreds of years, spiraling upwards to the ceiling while viscous excretion seeped in through the ceiling, pouring newer waste down. Even through the gas mask, they could smell the strong stench of decay that was prevalent everywhere. Rivers of dirty, murky water filled with shit snaked through the floral and fauna that had sprouted up around the trash pillars, feeding off the rotting matter that seemed to never end and emitting ambient light enough to give the entire chamber a ghastly purple glow.</p><p>It wasn't Kyle's first time seeing a trash planet, but this was still something to take in. The pillars of refuse did not seem to be just made out of waste - something was inside eating away at the waste from within, periodically releasing noxious fumes that were the result of some foul chemical reaction. &quot;Make sure there are no gaps in your armor and clothing,&quot; Kyle warned once more, forcing the squad to check their equipment again before moving forward.</p><p>Each step had a sickening squish to it, revealing countless tiny little critters and insects that escaped out of the squashed mud, scurrying away to safety while red moths swooped down, picking off their latest prey and returning to high up on the pillars, the air filled with a dizzying array of lifeforms that formed an ecosystem of the trash dumped from Tenar. One of the commandos resisted the urge to puke as he stepped closer to the pillar, noticing a decaying human body that had clearly drowned in the catacombs, its flesh consumed from within by maggots while a lizard nearby waited with bated breath, its glossy eyes blinking slowly.</p><p>As they moved forward, Kyle took out an empty potion vial, using the tips of his custom prototype exosuit arm to gingerly scoop a sample of the water, hoping the System would be able to recognize it and maybe give some information.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Toxic Sludge</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Not potable, not drinkable. Do not drink directly at any cost, not even under the pain of death.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>That was pretty useless.</em> Kyle sighed, but Sasha suddenly spoke into his brain. [Sir, another footprint.] Sasha motioned silently to an equally large salamander footprint hidden beneath the murky water. That raised the alertness of the squad immediately, and their repeaters were ready to shred anything that attacked them.</p><p>Kyle led the squad ahead, carefully trekking and keeping his movements quiet, avoiding splashing the murky water too much in case it attracted the wrong kind of attention. As they moved deeper into the chamber, following the snaking river of sludge that winded through the chamber, the exit tunnel was already out of sight, only the sights of never-ending waterfalls plunging from above into the chamber.</p><p>From the corner of his vision, Kyle spotted an object drop - a human corpse that fell along with the sludge, smacking against the pillar of refuse and tumbling along its bioluminescent edge before sliding down to the floor, soaking in the mud. Unfortunately for them, they were not the only ones who noticed this, a familiar skittering sound echoing over the splashes of mud. The squad quickly crouched and hid behind any large fungi or trash pile they could find, peeking out to observe a dozen rock spiders moving over in a group, scampering over the human body. Their worm-like mouths extended out of their central sphere body, the teeth gnashing and tearing apart at the dead human, ripping its tendons and muscles apart while the other spiders fought with each other over parts of the entrails that were dragged further and further.</p><p>The commotion began to attract more rock spiders as well as up to three more groups, some of them scampering from unknown locations to congregate while the squad kept as quiet as possible, hiding their figures from view. The first dozen began to snarl and snap at the other groups of rock spiders approaching, clearly territorial over the dropped meat. Interestingly, even as a rock spider crawled over where Kyle was hiding, it didn't seem to notice him, having no eyes to see. Kyle wasn't about to get in the middle of more than four dozen spiders contesting over food. Using his hand sign, he stuck it out ever so slightly, indicating for them to retreat back to the exit tunnel.</p><p>However, as soon as one of the commandos prepared to turn around to leave, his face came dangerously close to a rock spider, part of another fifth group that had approached from behind. In a moment of instinct, the commando fired his MK2 repeater at the rock spider, pulling the trigger hard. Five pellets burst out, nailing the rock spider right in its worm-like mouth and tearing the flesh inside out, causing it to let out a bloodcurdling shriek as it died.</p><p>Kyle knew the jig was up, and the rest of the rock spiders were now turning to face the direction of the commando who had just shot the pellets out. Before they could move, Kyle and Sasha popped out of their cover, unleashing a hailstorm of their bullets and nailing six rock spiders in a row.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Rock Spider, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Initiated</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Forge a different path through the pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>A different path?</em> Kyle hurriedly aimed the repeater once more, firing on the encroaching rock spiders who began to fan out, some leaping onto the pillars of refuse and using it to flank the squad from above. Each member of the squad began to fire, with Sasha swapping to her runic falchion, chopping away at any approaching rock spiders.</p><p>&quot;Sir, we can't stay here - the fight will bring more! We have to move back!&quot; One of the commandos roared over the din of pellet fire.</p><p>&quot;No, we move forward!&quot; Kyle urged, charging forward while swiveling the repeater rapidly, treating the rock spiders like target practice as he expertly double-tapped the trigger, resulting in a faster fire rate overall. The commandos were flabbergasted to see Kyle push ahead instead of retreating, but it was clear that the path behind them was slowly getting clogged up with more rock spiders who were attracted by the loud gunfire. With no time to argue, the squad moved as one, with Kyle and Sasha bringing up the rear and leaping about, slicing off the legs and the mouths of rock spiders.</p><p>With a battle cry, Sasha slammed the falchion into a nearby pillar, the pillar losing its precarious balance and beginning to teeter, falling down in a large collapse that sent a wave of mist and noxious fumes blanketing the squad and the rock spiders alike. While the crash pinned down a few rock spiders, the rest were unfazed, simply clambering over the collapsed pillar and lunging at Sasha.</p><p>As they raced through the chamber chased by swarms of rock spiders whose numbers seemed to multiply, Kyle kept his eyes peeled, his mind holding a 3D orientation of where the next exit should be. It was risky, and Kyle would have chosen to retreat if it had not been for the Trial's message. <em>If I can exit the chamber through a different route, I may get another 5000 EXP, which would give me another level.</em> He knew he needed every drop of EXP he could muster if he wanted to be confident enough to clear the dungeon, which he assumed would have Galactic Era tech.</p><p>Yet, the current chamber filled with trash didn't seem to possess any apparent technology. Kyle was starting to doubt that there would be anything of value here, but he focused on the goal of escaping first. However, something began to change in the rock spiders' behavior, and not every one of them chased the squad. Instead, some began to suck up the sludge in the rivers of murky water, seemingly chewing on them before clambering up a pillar. Kyle looked at one as its worm-like mouth suddenly extended like a cannon barrel aimed right at him, the rock spider suddenly ejecting a projectile made of sludge at medium speeds toward him.</p><p>While he easily dodged it, the sludge projectile slammed into the muddy ground, a sizzling sound disintegrating and breaking down whatever pieces of trash were around into black icky goo. <em>Are they shooting stomach acid at us?!</em> &quot;Dodge the sludge!&quot; Kyle cried out as he grabbed another commando nearby, tugging him out of the way as another sludge projectile whizzed past where the commando had just been standing.</p><p>Despite their best efforts to run, the chamber seemed to have no end. Kyle was sure that he had been running in a straight line, but it felt as if the chamber was in a never-ending loop. The commandos were also getting exhausted, still having to lug the supply of rations in their bags. With no end in sight, Kyle began to look for a different way out, finally spotting a path that sloped downwards into a natural cave entwined with fungi and algae across its surface, the opening only big enough for a man to squeeze through one at a time. &quot;Here, get in here!&quot;</p><p>The commandos didn't question the order, hurriedly tossing an arctech lantern in through the opening, with the first squeezing through. Kyle and Sasha stood their ground, firing with abandon at the incoming rock spiders while expertly dodging the sludge projectiles that shot their way.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Rock Spider, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p><em>If I killed five hundred of them, then that would be perfect.</em> Kyle grinned, relishing in the battle as he weaved through the horde of rock spiders, using his Tattoo Knife and exosuit arm to annihilate most of the approaching rock spiders. On the other side, Sasha was carving away relentlessly, her armor and gas mask already coated entirely in the black icky goo.</p><p>With each kill, Kyle and Sasha nimbly plucked and pocketed any arcia crystals they could find in the dead rock spiders, a wall of bodies beginning to pile up around the openings. Soon, the three commandos had managed to enter the cave. &quot;Sir, we're done!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sasha, go first!&quot; Kyle ordered as he continued to slice and jab with the knife, the exosuit arm punching and cracking a rock spider's armor. Sasha nodded, sprinting towards the opening while deftly dodging projectiles, her nimble body sliding into the gap without a hitch. Kyle soon followed suit, running into the opening and squeezing through the gap quickly while enraged rock spiders jabbed and tried to tear apart the opening with their spiky rock legs.</p><p>Kyle huffed and panted, catching his breath while the others slumped onto the floor, taking a break. The arctech lantern showed that they had entered a smaller corridor of sorts in a similar design to the one that they had been traversing at the start, the same mist also wafting in along with streams of murky water that slopped down. As the rock spiders beyond the gap struggled to get in, the squad took a break, resting on the dryer parts of the floor and drinking water while Sasha jabbed any rock spider who got too close.</p><p>Soon enough, the dead rock spider bodies were completely covering the gap, preventing any new rock spiders from getting through. Kyle too leaned against the wall, sipping on a water flask and a stamina potion vial, recovering his strength. In the brief respite, Kyle walked ahead of the squad with his own arctech lantern, exploring the little corridor that they had found themselves in.</p><p>Unlike the algae covered mess of the larger corridor, the walls here were far more clean. As Kyle continued walking further, the light of his arctech lantern revealed the walls to slowly form a gradient, changing from green hard stone to metal over its length. At the very end of the corridor, he could see a weird metallic door, one that felt somewhat familiar. &quot;Sasha, protect the squad,&quot; Kyle ordered, while he continued exploring forward alone.</p><p>As he neared the door, his vision was suddenly flooded by a recognizable system message.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Access Granted</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Temporary Administrator Privileges recognized. Please register at the nearest terminal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The metallic door at the end of the corridor slid open, but it failed halfway, electricity sparking at the hinges as its gears creaked, trying to overcome what sounded like centuries of rust. Kyle noticed that the door's metal parts were also corroded, reduced to a recognizable amalgamation of bacteria and sludge, characteristic of a metal nano-plague much like the one he had seen in the Oracle Chambers. <em>Finally, another Galactic Era ruin.</em></p><p>He used his custom exosuit arm, grabbing the edge of the door and forcing it apart bit by bit, gritting his teeth as the door slowly but surely moved until the mechanism restricting the door's movement finally snapped, allowing the door to slide open fully. No lights were turned on as Kyle entered, the entire place in complete disrepair. Broken electrical panels and wires consumed by the nano-plague were left dangling and scattered, and the tiles of the room cracked as well.</p><p>Unlike the Oracle Chambers, there were no bodies to be found - no signs of a fight were found. <em>Looks like it was an automated post.</em> Kyle walked up to a nearby monitor mounted on the wall, tapping it to see if it activated. It did not light up at all, and there was no power throughout the entire room. Kyle explored a bit more, traversing the room to see that there was a heavily bolted door, like a vault of sorts, tightly locked into the wall, with a damaged keypad next to it. As he got closer, he inspected the damage, noticing it wasn't too terrible. He carefully used his hands to connect two frayed wires together, the keypad's monitor lighting up only for a brief flicker before dying out.</p><p>He scanned the bolted vault door, noticing that there was a mechanical key slot in the door, a backup in case of the failure of the electronics. Kyle tested the strength of the door a little, using his exosuit arm to try and pry the door open, but to no avail.</p><p><em>Penchant for Violence!</em> Kyle tried once more, pulling as hard as he could, but the vault door barely budged, unmovable. <em>There might be a sign somewhere else that could give me a clue. Or the key could be somewhere around here.</em></p><p>As he looked around, he spotted something strange. Weirdly enough, at the end of the room was an interesting sight - three partitions that separated the end of the room into four sections. Kyle approached cautiously, his arctech lantern still scanning the dilapidated room while he noticed a small little infographic plastered onto the wall, half of it eaten away by insects. <em>Dangerous Personnel... huh...</em> Kyle couldn't make out the rest of the words, but as he inspected the partitions, their purpose became immediately clear, the edges of the partition featuring twenty laser emitters aimed towards either side of the wall. <em>It's a laser prison cell.</em></p><p>He didn't see any bodies of prisoners left behind, whoever was trapped here having clearly escaped. Kyle walked up to a control panel, tapping it and checking the gap behind it to see that the wiring was still intact, though it had no power to maintain its original function, the power cell within depleted. As he turned around, a glint of metal from the corner of his eyes alerted him to a rectangular high-tech battery lying on the floor inside one of the laser prison cells.</p><p>Confirming that the prison cell would not suddenly activate, Kyle walked up carefully, picking up the ancient battery with the exosuit arm in case it exploded. Old Galactic-Era batteries had a tendency to do that, the side effect of cramming so much energy into a small form factor.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Ancient Galactic-Era Battery (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Technological marvel of power compression.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Charge</strong>: 50% remaining.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Good enough.</em> Kyle took the battery back to the main control panel at the front of the room, plugging in the battery and booting up the system. No A.I. like the Oracle appeared, but the scrolling diagnostic texts showed that the battery was barely enough to run the room at its minimum functionality.</p><p>The laser emitters on the partition immediately turned on, forming a crisscrossing net across that threatened to burn every single atom that attempted to escape. <em>Seems like power is being focused on the prison's features. If I can either redirect it or find more power sources...</em> Kyle scoured the room, finally finding another battery pack, though it was also in another laser cell. He tapped the control panel, disabling the laser protection, before walking into the cell.</p><p>However, as soon as he stepped across the threshold, he suddenly felt his body become sluggish, slowing down tremendously as if his muscles had been replaced with lead, his legs nearly impossible to move. His heart pumped faster, his lungs struggling to inhale.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Active Suppression Engaged</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">All System Features disabled. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>What?!</em> Kyle's heart skipped a bit as he felt himself grow short of breath, as if every bonus and stat increase that he had accumulated in his lifetime was now unable to be bear, the burden on his body far too great. He clenched his teeth as he pushed forward step by step, his legs like logs as he picked up the battery before retreating beyond the laser cell, collapsing onto his knees hard.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Active Suppression Disengaged</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">All System Features enabled. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Power surged back into Kyle's veins, his eyes blinking rapidly as he took short, sharp, rapid breaths, trying to recover his senses. <em>This... this is a prison cell for System users!</em> Kyle quickly leaped to his feet, checking the control panel and its systems check. <em>Communication is totally destroyed; this entire room is cut off from the rest of the world. That's good.</em> Judging from the state of the door, Kyle assumed that he was the first one to open this area.</p><p>Still, the room was a dead-end, offering no other exits save for the heavily bolted vault door that Kyle clearly could not open at all. He still had a trial to clear, and his squad was still waiting for him. He unplugged the battery from the main control panel, pocketing it along with the other battery he had retrieved. Closing the door behind him with the strength of his exosuit arm, he returned to the squad. The three commandos were still resting, having recovered enough strength through the potions to try another push, while Sasha stared at Kyle with a curious gaze. [Sir, did you find anything?]</p><p>&quot;Nothing much.&quot; Kyle brushed it off, unwilling to reveal too much. If he told anyone else that there was a prison cell that could restrict the better part of his abilities, it would no doubt come back to bite him in the ass in the future. <em>Better to keep it to myself.</em> &quot;Are we ready to move?&quot;</p><p>[We'll have to widen the opening a little first.] Sasha didn't pry any further, readying her runic falchion to slide through the pile of rock spider corpses again. The three commandos got their repeaters ready, crouching and preparing to lay waste to anything that breached the gap. Kyle himself prepared as well.</p><p>Sasha used the same enhancement method, slicing through the gap and widening it greatly. As the diced-up parts of rock spiders began to tumble through the open hole, enraged rock spiders began to pour in, earning a barrage of withering fire that melted through their armor, the force of the pellets pushing them back. Kyle and Sasha took up the front, using their strength to force their way out and carve a path back to the surface.</p><p>The moment they peeked their heads out, Kyle was taken aback by the sheer number of rock spiders that were clamoring to get at them, nearly more than two hundred of them. The commandos could also see the sheer numbers that they faced, their faces balking. &quot;This is insanity - how are we going to make it out?&quot;</p><p>Without warning, a sudden burst of trash, mud, and fungi was sent flying in all directions, a large jaw lunging out from within the base of the pillars of refuse and swallowing more than a dozen rock spiders in one giant gulp. A humongous shadow swept across Kyle and Sasha as the new creature clambered out of its hiding spot deep in the ground, rising to its full height and towering over the squad, making even the calm Kyle start to sweat a little. <em>Wasn't it supposed to be just a tree trunk?</em></p><p><strong>Chapter 110 - Discovery</strong></p><p>The noxious salamander reared its gigantic body on its hind legs, the weight of its limbs resting on other pillars nearby that slightly buckled under the immense force while its webbed feet flattened fungi, flora, and insects alike. A sudden drop in pressure could be felt around Kyle as the salamander inhaled in, resulting in a series of sickening crunches as the rock spiders in its maw were crushed and pulverized by unknown mechanisms deep within the beast.</p><p>Already, the other rock spiders were scattering frantically, their spiky rock legs jabbing the ground furiously as they sprinted away, though it was impossible to escape the noxious salamander that seemed to occupy the entire area. Kyle and Sasha ducked as a barbed tail swung past right over them, dragging and carving through the ground in one fell swoop while the salamander chased the fleeing rock spiders, looking to eat more. Each step the salamander took sent tremors through the earth, frightening the commandos. They were well-trained to kill humans, but such monsters were far beyond what they were prepared to fight.</p><p>Kyle was trained to, but whatever EXP the Trial offered now meant nothing to Kyle - he wasn't about to try and kill the beast that was almost three stories high and the length of a regular patrol starship, at least not without enough information. It wouldn't be his largest alien kill, but all of them had been done with a functioning exosuit, at least. &quot;We're retreating back to where we came from. The moment that salamander gets out of range, we're leaving.&quot; He explained to the rest of the squad, the rest nodding back in response. No one came here to sacrifice their lives, not when they could simply retreat and fight another day, preferably with more firepower.</p><p>As soon as the noxious salamander disappeared beyond the various pillars, Kyle and Sasha led the squad out, keeping low as they moved with haste, sneaking through the rotting environment with a clear sense of urgency. However, for some unknown reason, the tremors felt by the salamander's footsteps did not subside, instead increasing with intensity as they neared the tunnel from which they had entered. &quot;Hold! Something isn't right!&quot; Kyle urged, but it was far too late.</p><p>From beyond a wall of refuse that obscured their vision, a second noxious salamander burst out in an exploding torrent of sludge and excretion, lunging right at Sasha and catching her off-guard. <em>Penchant for Violence!</em> Kyle clenched his armored right fist and kicked off as fast as he could, tackling Sasha right on the waist to knock her out of the way. The body of the noxious salamander soared past them and crashed into a river of sludge with a thunderous splash while Kyle and Sasha tumbled through the mud, their armor and gas masks coated in filth.</p><p>Sasha scrambled to her feet, leaping for the runic falchion as the three commandos began to fire at the attacking noxious salamander. The pellets lodged themselves into the slightly glossy scales on the salamander's skin, earning a shriek before the salamander turned to face them. With the salamander distracted, Kyle recovered into a fighting posture, drawing his Tattoo Knife and charging forward. Thankfully, the size of this salamander was about a third of the first one they had seen, though it still possessed tremendous muscular strength and agility.</p><p>The moment Kyle took three steps forward at a running pace, the salamander flicked its head in alertness, stopping its approach towards the three commandos while flicking its tail at Kyle, the barbs lined with seeping poison threatening to impale him through his guts. Without hesitation, Kyle nimbly leaped up high, the Penchant of Violence effect allowing him to jump two meters up to avoid the sweep of the tail before landing with a strike aimed right at the base of the salamander's tail. The custom prototype exosuit arm glowed as it imbued additional strength into the punch, the fist collapsing the scales proper and reaching flesh. A gruesome stench erupted from within in a ghastly pulse of bodily liquids and sludge as three red moths fluttered out from the wound, their feelers sharp as nails and threatening to stab him. They swarmed Kyle's face, forcing him to dedicate time to slicing the moths apart as the salamander recovered, giving him its full attention now. It inhaled sharply, the mist sucking up into its gills and mouth as its belly inflated fully.</p><p>As Kyle cut down the last moth with his Tattoo Knife, a compressed blast of air shot straight at him, slamming straight into his chest and sending him sprawling and tumbling backward. Kyle gasped and choked while he rolled on the floor, his innards suffering from the sudden impulse as he struggled to recover, his vision swirling when the shadow of the salamander's body loomed towards him. Before it could lunge, a barrage of pellets slammed right into its head, the three commandos buying time for Kyle.</p><p>The salamander growled, immediately charging towards the three commandos in a headlong rush. They dived out of the way as its head smashed into a pillar of refuse, temporarily disorientating while the squad re-positioned.</p><p>A blistering fast red flash raced up one of the pillars, Sasha using her powerful legs to climb up a few meters before leaping out in a backflip right above the noxious salamander. As she sailed through the air, the salamander shot another burst of air at her. Reading the movements of the salamander accurately, Sasha contorted her body, twisting and avoiding the incoming shot by using her runic falchion to pierce the incoming blast, the compressed air splitting apart and crashing against the ceiling, dislodging stalactites and slicing through unfortunate airborne insects too slow to evade.</p><p>With gravity as her force, she dove straight towards the salamander, falchion first. Her calloused hands gripped the hilt of the falchion tightly, and the cold sharp tip of the runic blade stabbed right into the body of the salamander, narrowly missing the head as the salamander tried to dodge. It let out a loud shriek, expelling the mist it had sucked in as Sasha clenched tightly, summoning all her strength to drag the falchion through the flesh, ignoring the resulting swarm of red moths that began to jab at her from all directions.</p><p>The salamander emitted a guttural roar of pain as it flinched, trying to flail its body to shake off Sasha. As its body twisted and flicked in all directions, the three commandos had to scamper, dodging and ducking in all directions. Its tail swept wildly but suddenly contorted itself backward and lunged towards Sasha, the barbs digging into her flesh as she was lifted upwards. The poison began to invade her bloodstream. Sasha used her hands and tried to pry the barbs out of her own body.</p><p>However, a sudden explosive tremor shook through the salamander's body, the tail immediately letting go of Sasha while she tumbled down onto the filthy floor, poisoned and injured. The wounded salamander twisted its head around, seeing a fearsome Kyle charging up its body, aiming for the runic falchion that was still lodged in its body.</p><p>Clasping its hilt with his armored hand, the imbued strength of the exosuit arm empowered his strikes even more as he carved bloody slashes deep into the body of the salamander. Scales and flesh were torn apart by the devastating combo; the red moths instantly split in half while Kyle let out a battle cry. While Sasha staggered to her feet, assisted by another commando, she could tell that Kyle's sword slashes had a higher strength even compared to when she activated the runic enchantment. &quot;Get to the exit! I'll handle him!&quot; Kyle roared, prompting Sasha and the others to limp away while the battle unfolded behind them.</p><p>The salamander stood no chance, Kyle unleashing a frenzy right in the middle and chopping all the way into its internals, dicing up the eerie glowing entrails and pulsating digestive tracts filled to the brim with rancid sludge accumulated over time. Uncaring about the stench, Kyle plowed his way to the very center, trying to find the heart. Yet instead of a heart, Kyle found six thick muscles wrapped around in a cocoon, siphoning what seemed to be arcia energy through its veins with each rapid pulse.</p><p>He jabbed the runic falchion forward before flicking it upwards, tearing through it in half from the bottom to reveal a singular arcia crystal embedded in the midst of the torn muscles, far larger than the ones he had found in the rock spiders. However, he did not grab it right away, instead continuing to slash the meat all around, the bodily fluids coating him entirely from head to toe.</p><p>Letting out a final whimper, the noxious salamander collapsed, keeling over while its limbs intermittently twitched, the life fading in its reptilian eyes as the arcia energy coursing through its veins began to peter out. A thunderous roar erupted from afar as if in response to the last cry of the salamander.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Young Noxious Salamander, +500 EXP</p><p></p><p><em>Young?</em> Kyle reached out and grabbed the arcia crystal into his hand, clambering his way out of the hole he had carved into the salamander.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Good Arcia Crystal (Basic)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Rechargeable with the correct modifications.</em> </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle didn't have time to consider the implications of the system message, noticing that the collapsed salamander had crashed into a pillar of refuse that was teetering on the brink of collapse. He could only watch as the towering pillar began to crumble, leaning towards the side and slamming into another nearby pillar, causing a domino effect that fell in the same direction as where Sasha and the rest of the squad were heading.</p><p>The mountains of trash and sludge fell like a torrential rain, forcing Sasha to retreat while the exit tunnel was now heavily blocked by the never-ending collapse of the pillars stacking up onto of one another into a thick pile that would take ages to carve through, even if Sasha used her runic falchion. [Sir, the exit is blocked!] Sasha's voice exclaimed in Kyle's head.</p><p>Another roar boomed out from across the chamber like a crack of thunder, the squad's expression paling as they could feel the tremors approaching them, the vibrations causing the mud to violently squirm with each slam. &quot;That's not good...&quot; One of the commandos gulped instinctively, checking his repeater and frantically wiping the residual mud off it.</p><p>Kyle knew exactly what was coming - the question was what to do next. <em>Penchant of Violence is still on cooldown, but the rest of my skills are still functioning. It's going to take a while to break out through the collapsed trash, better to find another path.</em> He was about to suggest a new battle plan until he noticed Sasha breathing heavily, drinking a slew of various potion vials as she tried to catch her breath, unwilling to show any signs of weakness. The other commandos also suffered minor bruises and scratches that were starting to fester as well, one of them even having a broken arm dangle lifelessly.</p><p><em>The correct choice would be to sacrifice the three commandos to stall the salamander while Sasha and I find a way out of this chamber.</em> Kyle nearly started before he caught himself halfway. <em>I'm not running a gang here, I'm running a rebel movement. If I mindlessly sacrifice troops against something I can clearly defeat, it would be a bad look for other recruits. On the other hand...</em></p><p>&quot;You three, grab her and go back towards the cave we first found.&quot; Kyle quickly pieced together the next steps, planning the best course of action while taking into account the future. That cave was the safest location he could think of, especially with their path of retreat completely blocked off. &quot;I'll fend it off until you're all recovered and ready to fight once more.&quot;</p><p>[Sir, I can still fight!]</p><p>&quot;Not now.&quot; Kyle ignored Sasha's words, stepping away and flicking salamander's blood off the blade of the runic falchion with a furious flick.</p><p>[But sir, that salamander must be three times larger in size!]</p><p>&quot;Good. Then it'll be a worthy fight.&quot; Kyle grinned, his steps firm and steady as he walked towards the approaching tremors, undeterred. The sight of his strong back and blade at the ready burned itself into the memory of the three commandos and Sasha, all of them staring at him in awe and admiration. Already the expressions of the three commandos were turning from reluctant soldiers to signs of loyalty, though Kyle did not turn around to witness it.</p><p>As the rest of the squad made their way back to the cave they found, Kyle readied himself, checking all of his gear once more. A few armor plates on his leg were already punctured while he stretched his limbs in all directions as though he was going for a routine exercise.</p><p>In the distance, his keen eyes could spot a raging black figure that was charging right at him, blasting and shoving aside any environmental obstacles like they were ragdolls. He pulled up the Aspis MK2 repeater, activating its overcharge function and pushing his own internal arcia energy into it. The barrel's engraving glowed brilliantly as the metal itself became red hot, on the verge of deforming while Kyle pulled the trigger with the stock pushing against his chest.</p><p>A straight line of pellets erupted like a laser, aimed right at the head of the incoming larger salamander. The empowered pellets almost broke the sound barrier, puncturing the dense scales protecting its vitals easily and tearing apart flesh. With a grunt, Kyle dragged the barrel while controlling the recoil, the laser-focused rain of pellets now blasting into the left eye of the salamander.</p><p>The sudden jolting pain of its eye being shredded into a slurry of meat caused it to recoil, its initial momentum slightly lost. It stumbled as it tripped into a deep pit of mud, its body swerving off course and tail swinging wildly, the sharp barbs cutting through the air where Kyle had been standing. Kyle dove to the ground headfirst, rolling out of the way as the large salamander tumbled and crashed into a mountain of trash, sending insects, rodents, and rock spiders fleeing from their previous hiding spots within.</p><p>Kyle hurriedly recovered to a fighting stance, pulling up his repeater again only to notice that the red hot barrel had been deformed during the dive, proving useless for shooting anything anymore. The moment he tossed the repeater aside, alarm bells started to ring in his mind as he instinctively ducked, a wave of compressed air tearing through the chamber and cutting pillars right through.</p><p>He swerved, dodged, and weaved through the flora and fauna as more blasts of compressed air shot towards him, far more powerful than the one he was facing before. As he rolled on the ground through the mud, a towering shadow loomed over him, the salamander's size blocking the bio-luminsicent glow of the fungi all around. It was only now that Kyle fully comprehended the sheer size of what he was facing.</p><p>The larger salamander raised itself on its hind legs, almost rivaling the mountains and pillars of trash in height as it let out a guttural roar that would have deafened anyone close enough to its maw. Its body was covered in dense armored scales that were stained with the same color as the mud and sludge around, while the barbs on its tails were the size of longswords, threatening to impale Kyle if he was ever unfortunate enough to come face to face with it.</p><p>Amdist the armoured scales, strange warts and pods that glowed with pulsating arcia energy were visible on its back, Kyle mentally targeting them as potential weak points. The salamander's furious gaze swooped back onto Kyle as soon as it was done with its roar, the battle commencing proper with Kyle leaping out of the way to avoid an incoming stomp.</p><p>The barbed tail swung towards Kyle with full force, the width of the tail far larger than what Kyle could jump over. Gritting his teeth and clenching his jaw, Kyle brandished the runic falchion gripped in his right armored hand, blocking the incoming barbs and digging in his feet. The impact of the barbs sent reverberations through his arms, his muscles numbing as he was sent skidding backward through the mud for three meters, some of the barbs narrowly missing his gas mask.</p><p>&quot;That all you got?&quot; Kyle took the temporary chance to deliver a slash, the runic falchion cutting through the armored scales of the tail and finding soft flesh within. The tail recoiled backwards in pain, before the salamander lunged at Kyle with its gaping maw, intending to swallow him.</p><p>Kyle deftly side-stepped the incoming lunge, the blade spinning around in a vicious slash that aimed right at the still-injured eye, cutting through to the nerves and sending it reeling backward. He quickly charged towards the flailing salamander, unwilling to let up the pressure. <em>There should be a weak spot where I shot it in the head - huh?</em></p><p>Despite the barrage of pellets that he had seen tear through the armoured scales, new armour was being rapidly regenerated, growing over the wounds in real-time and forcing Kyle to reopen the wound. The salamander flicked its body back, slamming into Kyle and sending him flying back, though Kyle easily recovered due to him blocking the impact with his exosuit arm.</p><p>As he continued his fight, he also noticed that the wound he had inflicted on his barbed tail was also healing over time. <em>I can't fight a battle of endurance - I have to find a way to kill him in one hit!</em></p><p>The battle raged on for another five minutes, neither side truly landing a solid blow on the other as they fought across the entire chamber, their battlefield continuously changing. Kyle's eyes darted around rapidly as he rapidly recalculated attack trajectories for every new object in his surroundings, using it to his advantage to exploit the blind spot. Kyle found a climbable pillar, leaping up and utilizing it to launch himself off onto the top of the furious salamander, right next to the glowing pods.</p><p>Before he could use the runic falchion to burst the pods, the glowing pods themselves began to swell larger in size, exploding outwards and unleashing a disgusting stench that sent Kyle staggering even as he inhaled through his gas mask. Unexpectedly, something from within the pod lunged towards him, his battle instincts quickly swinging the blade to chop it down.</p><p>As he recovered his senses, he soon realized that he had just cut down a baby salamander, its translucent glossy skin still fresh with goo and lack of pigmentation. <em>The pods are its babies?!</em> Kyle spun around to see five more pods bursting, revealing a squad of baby salamanders that immediately targeted him as the enemy.</p><p>The large salamander suddenly twisted its body, shaking Kyle and the baby salamanders off its back and flinging them aside. Kyle twisted his body, controlling his landing while the salamanders landed with grace as well, instantly charging towards him. Other glowing pods began to burst as well from the large salamander's back, revealing more than two dozen baby salamanders that began to swarm toward him.</p><p>&quot;Sasha, are you ready? Now would be a good time to help out.&quot;</p><p>[Just a bit more, sir!]</p><p>For a brief moment, a memory of his former life betrayal flashed through his mind, even as he readied the runic falchion and the Tattoo knife in separate hands. <em>If I were Sasha, I would have taken this chance to run away and leave my boss to die. Maybe she is lying to me, and there is no help coming. Will it happen again to me? Will I have to take revenge once again on those who betrayed me?</em> He started to doubt the original plan he had, aimed at creating an inspirational story to galvanize the rebel movements with his 'heroic� sacrifice. Yet deep in his subconscious, a hidden fear began to rise to the surface once more; his body no longer possessed his former genetic modifications that removed such unnecessary emotions and thoughts.</p><p>It was not a fear of the enemy, for Kyle knew he wouldn't lose against the salamanders. Instead, it was something that had been engraved in him since he arrived here, a simple question that had been persistent with him. <em>Can I trust anyone but myself anymore?</em> Already Guang Hwa had betrayed the Seven Snakes previously, and Kyle always had the mindset that it was only a matter of time before his own vipers tried to kill him. This was the main reason why he had not told anybody too much about the Oracle Chambers or of his origins - even after spending more than a year with them, Kyle still could not trust anyone but himself for his own survival, not even Sasha. He had lost track of the countless 'loyal' employees he had over the course of his former life that he had personally executed for betraying his criminal empire, their faceless visages washing over him in a never-ending stream.</p><p>He closed his eyes as the stampede of baby salamanders approached him in a frenzy, preparing himself for a possible back-stab, a betrayal. <em>Even in this new life, some things don't change. Looks like I can only count on mys-</em></p><p>[Sir, we're here!] Sasha's excited voice came in, Kyle opening his eyes to see Sasha and even the other three commandos charging right into the fray. [We'll handle the smaller ones!]. They fired their Aspis MK2 repeaters over the swarm of baby salamanders, the pellets easily penetrating the translucent, unarmoured skin.</p><p><em>They... they came back...?</em> Kyle was stunned for a moment but shoved whatever emotions and thoughts he had to the back of his mind, dual-wielding both the falchion and knife and charging forward in a straight line towards the roaring large salamander. <em>Penchant for Violence!</em></p><p>The familiar power surged through his veins as he unleashed a brutal combo, each arm cutting, jabbing, slashing with force, the armoured scales of the salamander cracking and peeling apart like they were sheets of ice. Even the salamander's attempts to counterattack were useless, Kyle dodging each of them with ease.</p><p>Before the salamander could rear up again for another attack, Kyle lunged toward its belly, diving deep once again right into the flesh with abandon. <em>Its heart should be an arcia crystal as well - I just have to find it!</em></p><p>Outside, Sasha had already cleaned up most of the baby salamanders, now focusing her firepower on the large salamander. However, instead of the large salamander trying to squash her, it coiled up its barbed tail, using the barbs to protect itself from the pellets, all while arcia energy sparked and accumulated at its tails, stemming from within the body. [Sir, something bad is charging at the tail - the source is in the very center!]</p><p>&quot;On it.&quot; With the direction given now, Kyle drilled his way through the Penchant of Violence, allowing him to churn through the flesh rapidly with ease, soon reaching the heart, which was a far larger cocoon compared to the young salamander he had slain before. He performed the same procedure, severing every connecting flesh tendril to the central arcia crystal.</p><p>However, instead of letting out a death cry, arcia energy continued to charge on the tail; Kyle even noticed that the pulsating arcia energy in the body did not subside. <em>Shit, it has another crystal!</em> &quot;Sasha, what's happening outside?&quot;</p><p>[It's about to cast an arcia engraving on its tail!]</p><p><em>Not good!</em> Kyle raced to find the other crystal but could tell that he wouldn't be able to find it in time. Instead of trying to dig any further, he stretched out his hand and focused his mind on the surging arcia energy. <em>Arcia Disruption!</em></p><p>The flow of arcia energy suddenly reversed, the sparks at the tail petering out as the salamander let out a high-pitched scream that stunned the rest of the squad outside, its lower body rapidly disintegrating and melting, the resulting liquid seemingly being sucked and coalescing in a large black crystal, leaving the upper half to collapse and squirm violently. Kyle was flung out of the body by the sudden sundering, tumbling onto the floor painfully with one of the arcia crystals held tightly in his hands.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Patriarch Noxious Salamander, +2000 EXP</p><p></p><p>Kyle gasped for air as he struggled to get back to his feet. He heard footsteps approaching him, prompting him to raise his Tattoo Knife in instinctive self-defense, before finally recognizing that it was Sasha. [Sir, are you okay?]</p><p>&quot;I'm fine.&quot; Kyle nodded weakly, acting like it was nothing, though his body was aching all over, scratches and cuts all over his skin, his blood-stained face panting heavily. He pulled out a health potion vial from one of his side pockets, downing it in one single gulp, exhaling as the regenerative effects took over. &quot;We need to move - that might not have been the last of them. We'll have to find a new exit as well.&quot;</p><p>[Sir, about that... the exit is actually right behind you.] Sasha motioned over Kyle's shoulder. Sure enough, an opening was visible in the chamber's wall, the battle with the salamander having taken Kyle all across its length to the other side. Kyle nodded, putting one foot forward before stumbling, Sasha lunging to grab and support him with her shoulders. He tried to stand on his own two feet, but Sasha held his arm down firmly as they limped towards the opening. Kyle squinted his eyes in suspicion, assuming Sasha was doing this for an ulterior motive. However, it soon became clear that Sasha just wanted to help him, showing no signs of betrayal, causing turmoil in Kyle's mind.</p><p>&quot;Wh... why did you come back?&quot; Kyle muttered weakly. &quot;That was your best chance to kill me and be free.&quot;</p><p>Sasha raised her eyebrows, an awkward silence resting between the two before Sasha finally spoke with a wide grin. [If I killed you now, how would I be able to see what you've promised me? I won't let you die, not until you show me the true heights you mentioned.]</p><p>Kyle's mind recalled his chat in the Culdao Peaks, his face smiling a little as he could finally put a reason for Sasha's lack of betrayal. &quot;Are you sure you want to wait that long? It might take years. Decades, even.&quot;</p><p>[Take as long as you want. We've got time.] Sasha averted her gaze slightly as they continued to walk towards the opening.</p><p>Unlike the corridor from which they had entered the chamber, this opening was a standard circular sewage tunnel, sludge dripping out through a canal drop by drop. The squad ignored the pervasive stench, the smell from the rotten chamber far worse. &quot;I'm alright now,&quot; Kyle shrugged off Sasha's support, clambering up into the sewage tunnel himself as strength finally returned to his limbs, regaining his proper self.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Trial Cleared</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Bonus free points granted.</p><p><em>The EXP required for each level is exponentially increasing rapidly...</em> Kyle felt a bit disappointed at the rewards the System gave. While he internally already knew that he could not rely on the System alone to increase his strength and power, it was still a necessary crutch. If he did not have such a System, he would not have been able to access the Oracle Chambers nor the laser prison cells he discovered, nor would he have had access to the combat skills necessary. <em>It would still be possible to kill the salamanders without it, albeit a bit longer</em></p><p>&quot;We should be able to find a way up to the third layer. Let's move.&quot; Kyle ordered, the squad complying almost instantly. Whatever suspicion, assumptions, or doubts the three commandos had harbored about him were now completely eliminated, having witnessed Kyle's 'heroic' sacrifice for their sake. Kyle held a small smile on his face as they trekked down the tunnels, knowing the plan had paid off and would continue to give returns over time.</p><p>True enough to Dekar's map, there was an exit tunnel at the very end, a simple ladder that ascended up to the third layer. As they clambered up the rungs, Kyle found himself in yet another similar abandoned hideout to the one they had occupied on the other end of the third layer. However, unlike the abandoned hideout, most of the machinery and furnishing were still in place, coated in copious amounts of dust, soot, and dried grease.</p><p>It was a trivial affair to find their way back through the third layer to the fourth layer, thanks to the provided map, but it soon became clear that the route on the third layer between the two hideouts was too complex to traverse on a daily basis to be used as a proper base. Kyle immediately designated the newly discovered hideout as a backup one in case of an emergency, to be evacuated towards quickly using the fourth layer dungeon, whose layout they were now familiar with.</p><p>Returning to the main hideout, many were shocked to see Kyle, Sasha, and the three commandos coated in filth and sludge as though they had just taken a mudbath, the rancid scent permeating the chamber and living quarters. They had been out for a day now, including the time it took to traverse the third layer back. Kyle ignored the complaints of the smell as he walked up to the astounded Dekar and Feldon. Both of them recoiled from the stench and pinched their nose tightly, Feldon almost gagging instinctively. &quot;You've made it back from the fourth layer?&quot; Dekar struggled to stay standing.</p><p>&quot;I have. Feldon, Lisa. Sasha will instruct you on a new training routine using the fourth layer. It will be useful to harden the new Ghosts as well to carve out a potential escape route through that method.&quot; Kyle explained the next steps quickly. &quot;We will need to stock up our new escape hideout as well.&quot; He pointed towards the third layer map, marking a chamber right next to a tunnel that led to Desham.</p><p>&quot;Understood!&quot; Feldon saluted with his free hand, hurriedly rushing away to get rid of the scent.</p><p>&quot;How's the progress on Yona?&quot; Kyle asked.</p><p>&quot;Almost done, she should be ready with every detail we need to infiltrate Harrison's military industrial complex.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is there a way in?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is, but it requires one of us to infiltrate their offices. All of us here would immediately draw suspicion and attention, even if we try to disguise ourselves. The identity checks are sure to be far more stringent than some random Nest guard. We would be revealed almost immediately!&quot;</p><p>&quot;<em>Almost</em> all of us - I know just the perfect candidate for this task.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 111 - Military Industrial Complex</strong></p><p>The fumes belched out in never-ending pulses from tall smoke stacks that dotted the landscape, the military-industrial complex of Tenar seemingly having no end, expanding even beyond the ancient walls and encroaching onto the nearby pastures and large expansive fields. Instead of greenery and grass stretching into the horizon, monstrous factories and humongous refineries were the mainstay of the view here, filtering the daylight that spilled out onto the paved streets.</p><p>Flywheel generators and gravity batteries towered over sixty meters high in the distance, the residual sounds of clanging and burning dominating the air, a far cry from the peace and tranquility of the residential district. Here, industry seeped into every aspect of life. Sleepy workers covered in soot and grime all over their work outfits rubbed their groggy eyes as they lumbered back to their dorms, snatching every minute of shuteye they could before their shifts started again.</p><p>A loud bell resounded through the complex, signalling the start of the next shift as thousands of workers, engineers, researchers and clerks filtered out from their dormitories in dense swarms, congregating on open parade squares situated next to the domineering factories, their oppressive black visage casting large shadows over the square.</p><p>[Rollcall!] A foreman shouted into an arctech radio, his voice carried on arctech speakers situated all around the square and prompting assistants to run down the thick rows of employees, counting heads and checking for names. [We only have two weeks left till the Grand Exhibition - projects such as Aurtla and Guryi have not been completed! It is our responsibility to put forward our best foot; Versia is counting on us! Any failure will be a catastrophe for both you and me. Do your part!]</p><p>&quot;YES, SIR!&quot; The workers chanted in sync, none of them averting their eyes from the foreman.</p><p>[Good. Confirm your assigned role with your team leaders, and remember to get your work card punched.] The foreman had the workers dismissed, the throng of workers dispersing into a hundred swarms as they criss-crossed each other, trying to get to their workplace. Many boarded wagons which carried them to their departments, some situated miles away.</p><p>The foreman let out an exasperated sigh as he returned back to his office, going over the attendance list with his assistants compiling the information. Sitting down on a black stool and thumbing through the sheets of paper stacked on his narrow wooden desk, he soon noticed something strange. &quot;Hey, where are the sub-contractors? Why aren't they on this list?&quot; He questioned the assistant nearest to him.</p><p>The assistant scratched his head in confusion, eyes darting about thinking that the foreman was talking to someone else, until he met the foreman's gaze again, clearly looking directly at him. &quot;H-huh? Which subcontractor? Glovcal Works or-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huriga Cleaning Services, you idiot! Their whole team is fucking missing!&quot; The foreman scolded. &quot;Get their manager on the radio right now!&quot;</p><p>While the assistant scrambled to find their radio, the foreman continued to inspect the list, noticing quite a few employees who were reported late. &quot;Dock Employee 2248 and Employee 5063's wages - dock them an hour for every minute missed.&quot; He lazily scribbled onto a slip of paper, handing it over to a nearby clerk.</p><p>An hour passed, the foreman looking up at a nearby clock before realizing that the assistant had not gotten the manager on the line. &quot;Hey, what's the hold up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, they aren't responding to any of my calls!&quot; The assistant nervously replied from a desk further down the hall of the office.</p><p>&quot;And you only decided to tell me now?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You fucking useless-&quot; The foreman was about to raise his voice again but decided not to waste any effort on the dumb assistant, instead pulling up a work chart of all assigned subcontractors and their tasks.</p><p>Before the foreman could cancel a line, a group of two dozen cleaners entered the office, wearing dark blue work overalls with the logo of Huriga Cleaning Services clearly emblazoned across their chest and back. They hauled cleaning supplies in a large cart, their manager walking up to the foreman's desk with a pensive smile on his face. &quot;Sorry, Bernard, traffic was pretty bad just now.&quot; The manager apologized with a slight bow.</p><p>&quot;Bah, don't give me any excuse, you old slag.&quot; Bernard clenched his fist while picking up an Euria pipe in the other, smoking. &quot;You've been late more than five times now. How the hell am I going to explain to Harrison? Maybe we should dock your contract.&quot; He placed the tip of his pen down on the work chart, about to cancel out their name, when the manager leaned forward quickly, trying to stop the foreman.</p><p>&quot;Really, you know it's not my fault. Johan Street is always chock full of wagons - even if I wanted to arrive on time, it would be near impossible!&quot; The manager pleaded, his grip tight.</p><p>Bernard let out a sigh, dropping the pen and scratching his balding head, the manager letting out a sigh of relief while Bernard complained:&quot;You're always getting off easy - just because we're old time buddies doesn't mean I can keep covering for you all the time! You could just come out earlier!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on, Bernard, it's only an hour!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you have any idea how many other cleaning crews out there would kill to have the contract that you have right now? For each of your assigned areas, hundreds would kill for such a lucrative payment, especially given the terrible conditions outside Tenar.&quot; Bernard chided. &quot;And you barely even look out for me! Why do I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you talking about - Of course I always look out for you.&quot; Huriga grinned, glancing around with a shifty look before rummaging through his overall's pocket, pulling out a tiny vial, a viscous dark-yellow liquid swirling inside. &quot;On the house.&quot;</p><p>Bernard's eyes widened when he spotted the vial. &quot;Are you crazy, bringing that here? How the hell did you get it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like I said, I always look out for you. Free of charge.&quot; Huriga slid the vial over, Bernard frantically snatching it and pocketing it before any of the clerks and assistants nearby spotted him. His originally antagonistic behavior faded like snow on a summer's day, his face beaming with happiness instead as if he had never been angry at Huriga.</p><p>&quot;I knew you could always pull through, Huriga. You're the best.&quot; Bernard had a wide smile from cheek to cheek. &quot;You better get going to the dorm areas - if you get any later, they are gonna get real mad at both you and me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, about that. I was thinking about taking two areas at once.&quot;</p><p>Bernard raised an eyebrow. &quot;So that's why you've brought so many people. Hmm... I can't have you do two dorm areas now; the rest are already allocated to their own cleaning crews. Why do you even want to do two at once?&quot;</p><p>Huriga leaned over, his voice dropping to a whisper. &quot;That vial ain't cheap. You and I both know it. Do me a favor, and I'll get you another one. How's that?&quot;</p><p>Bernard squinted his eyes in suspicion before scanning the work chart again. &quot;Let's see here... I only got the mansion here. You're going to need clearance to get in there.&quot;</p><p>Huriga's face paled slightly at the mention of that. If Bernard had been looking closely, he might have noticed Huriga's eyes trembling for a while before firming up once more. &quot;Come on, Bernard, you know I don't have the clearance for that area. There has got to be another area I can clean!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope, nothing else here. Rest has been taken up. Seriously, if you wanted two areas, you should have told me the day before and maybe not show up late!&quot; Bernard retorted, but his hand continuously felt the precious vial in his pockets, already thinking about when he could get the next dose. He beckoned for Huriga to come closer, whispering. &quot;If I get you in, two vials.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, if I get double areas for the next two weeks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Deal. Hey, you! These men need temporary clearance for Zone A!&quot; Bernard hollered to the dumb assistant, who quickly scampered over while clutching a stack of papers tightly.</p><p>&quot;But, sir, these passes are not to be given out lightly. They'll have to be approved by-&quot;</p><p>&quot;By the foreman. That's me, you dingus! Now get me those temporary passes, or I'll dock your pay!&quot;</p><p>Within minutes, a dozen of the cleaners had a temporary pass, a simple card pinned to their work overalls. &quot;The pass only last for your allocated cleaning time. Don't overstay - you won't like military jail.&quot; Bernard warned the group. &quot;Don't cross any lines, stick to your assigned zones, and don't touch anything that isn't yours. Understood?&quot;</p><p>The cleaners nodded, with Huriga leading them out of the office. They split up themselves into two separate wagons, heading to their zones. The wagons rolled through the vast industrial complex, their paths eventually diverging over time with one of them heading towards the center.</p><p>Inside the back of the wagon, the cleaners didn't say much, some closing their eyes to get some sleep, while two others muttered among themselves, their voices kept low and hushed. &quot;Hey, you said there wouldn't be any hiccups.&quot; One of them whispered angrily, jabbing the other in the ribs and causing him to flinch.</p><p>&quot;What the fuck? Of course there isn't. Huriga got us in - what else do you want?&quot; The other rubbed his ribs gently, glaring at his friend.</p><p>&quot;Are you blind? There's a new girl here! Why is there a new girl as part of the crew?&quot; The first motioned with his chin towards a lady sitting at the other corner of the wagon, her clear eyes looking out the back at the scenery passing by. She wore a tight mask that covered her skin from the nose down, the work overalls hiding her outline.</p><p>The other cleaner scoffed. &quot;What's the matter? Want to date her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck no - I've seen what's under her mask. Also, I've been going steady recently.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hah! You? Steady? You're joking. Nerves getting to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm serious, you asshole.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, that girl selling horse milk at the end of Asha Street? Brother, you've been cheated - that girl is dating four guys right now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha- how do you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She's dating me right now, too!&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; The first exclaimed loudly, his voice raised and attracting everyone's attention, even the girl at the back. He quickly calmed himself down, taking a few deep breaths to control his rising temper, before continuing: &quot;Firstly, that's not the girl I'm going steady with.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then why the hell were you so shocked?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, you don't need to lie to me. I know you dated her before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you know there are so many people dating her, then why are you dating too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just because there's five players in the game doesn't mean I can't join the game too. There's no player limit, is there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha- look, you're not focusing on what we got to do. That new girl is a liability - simple as that. We should find a way to make sure she doesn't interfere with what we have to do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah, she's not going to do anything - she's brand new!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly why a single fumble from her could screw up everything! Do you even understand the importance of what we're trying to do? Our lives in Versia depend on this!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright, alright, relax. We can assign her to refill the buckets; that'll keep her away for long enough.&quot;</p><p>Soon, the wagon crawled to a halt, a thump along the side of the wagon prompting the cleaners to get up. The new girl looked around blankly, her expression naive, before one of the other cleaners tapped her on the shoulders. &quot;We need to get out for a security check.&quot;</p><p>The new girl nodded, dropping down to see Huriga chatting with a Versian sergeant while other soldiers boarded the wagon, checking the cleaning supplies and equipment to make sure there was nothing dangerous. The Versian sergeant spotted the girl, squinting in suspicion. &quot;Who's the new girl? You hiring comfort women now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They aren't that cheap to hire, you know. At least, not for how much tenars I earn.&quot; Huriga grinned. &quot;No, the girl is just a new cleaner. I promised her father to take care of her, so there you go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then what's with the mask?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Trust me, you don't want to see what's behind it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Try me. I'm not going to let anyone past this checkpoint without seeing their faces.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't blame me - you asked for it.&quot; Huriga motioned to the new girl to pull down the mask, the cleaners all immediately averting their gaze. The Versian sergeant eyes bulged, before his reflex instinct cause him to gag. He staggered to the side, vomitting out his breakfast in its entirety with a loud retch. As soon as he recovered, he too averted his gaze from the new girl, waving frantically at Huriga and shaking his head.</p><p>&quot;Painful accident. Lost her voice.&quot; Huriga shrugged, signaling to the girl to cover up once more. &quot;Look, I'm already behind schedule. I'll treat you to lunch next time I come around.&quot;</p><p>The Versian sergeant gasped for air as he stood back up to his full height, taking deep breaths. &quot;You better treat me to lunch and breakfast for that fucking atrocity!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, that's not fair, you asked for it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;... Fine. Lunch.&quot;</p><p>The soldiers got off the wagon, reporting to the sergeant. &quot;All clear, sir. No bombs or funny arctech.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. Alright, let them through!&quot;</p><p>The checkpoint gate opened to reveal a large, expansive road with well-manicured bushes planted along the side with exceptional accuracy, the distance between them immaculately in both pattern and calculation. The grass on the rolling lawn that spread out beyond the edges of the road was trimmed well, too, showing clear signs of regular gardening on a daily basis. The road snaked up a slight slope, curving around and leading to the front of a large mansion, its prestigious white pillars glinting in the distance while the sheer number of windows made the first-time cleaners� jaws drop.</p><p>The wagon soon rolled up to the porch, and five armed Versian guards immediately approached the wagon. The cleaners hopped off again one by one, intimidated by the large arctech knight armor that each of the guards wore, their height nearly 2.1 meters from the sheer amount of metal infused into its structure. Huriga's usual charisma faltered, and one of the armored guards walked up, each step clanging with domineering metal. &quot;Business?&quot; A somber tone spoke from behind the armored helmet, his stern eyes only shown through a slit on the faceplate adorned with the emblem of Versia.</p><p>&quot;Huriga Cleaning Services. We've been assigned this area by Foreman Bernard.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Passes?&quot;</p><p>Huriga frantically motioned to the rest of the cleaners, getting them to line up and brandish their temporary passes pinned onto their work overalls. A few of them trembled as the armored guards inspected them thoroughly, checking their pockets and belongings. None of the guards flinched even as they pulled down the mask of the new girl, though they were quick in covering up her again.</p><p>&quot;Stay on the first floor. The second floor is off-limits. Anyone crossing will be shot on sight.&quot; The armored guard warned once more, stepping aside to allow Huriga and the cleaning crew to enter, lugging their buckets, mops, clothes, and other essentials up the grand steps that numbered about a dozen up towards the main door.</p><p>A butler greeted them at the main door, though his expression was clearly cautious. &quot;Good to meet you, sir Huriga, but I don't recall any cleaning crews being assigned to this area.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know anything about assignments; I just follow wherever the foreman tells me to go.&quot; Huriga shrugged, but his eyes were already captivated by the elegance of the door's construction. Ornamental gold lined every edge, and white slivers marked the edges of the carvings in the ancient oak frame; the details and precision were marvelous to witness. Even the cleaners were stuck with awe, gaping with their mouths open along with hushed sounds of exclamation.</p><p>&quot;Are you going to stare, or are you here to clean?&quot; The butler sternly glared at Huriga, causing Huriga to shake himself out of his stupor, quickly stepping through the opened main door and entering the main hall proper. The main hall wasn't any better at making Huriga focused on cleaning. Its glistening rails and stairs that looked like a palace staircase were too eye-catching, not to mention the dazzling chandeliers hung precariously above that were larger than some of the rooms the cleaners had slept in the day before. Countless rooms and echoes of other guards' footsteps vibrated through the polished marble floor that stretched the entire length of the mansion, each stream of light pouring through the windows and reflecting off the tiles like a mirror.</p><p>&quot;You'll be cleaning this main hall, along with every other room in the mansion on the first floor.&quot; The butler informed in a matter-of-fact tone. &quot;Should you require additional supplies, we do have the necessary equipment to clean everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks, we can take it from here.&quot; Huriga gave a genial smile, acting professional though the cleaners behind him were already murmuring among each other, hardly listening in.</p><p>&quot;My god, why do they even need us? Whoever owns this mansion could buy out a hundred maids if he wanted to!&quot; One of the cleaners exclaimed in awe.</p><p>&quot;The master himself is currently at the Versian Parliament, and the other servants have all been summarily executed by firing squads for stealing relics from the mansion. You would be wise to keep your hands to yourself. As well as your comments.&quot; The butler noted sternly before leaving them alone in the main hall. Two guards eyed the group of cleaners from the second floor's railing as they got to work, mixing soap with water and soaking cloths, mop, and rags alike.</p><p>They split up across the hall, each area designated by Huriga who oversaw the whole operation, eyeing the guards carefully. Soon an hour passed, the cleaners having scrubbed only half of the wide hall, the six of them barely enough to get the job done fast enough. They took breaks in-between, chit-chatted and generally did their cleaning without too much complaints. The guards were already bored of watching their menial tasks and repetitive motions, instead bickering among each other.</p><p>Huriga whistled as he snacked on a piece of bread, careful to make sure no crumbs fell to the floor. He leaned against a nearby pillar, where two other cleaners were sitting, looking off into the distance. &quot;You see those guards?&quot; Huriga spoke through the corner of his mouth, trying to avoid suspicion.</p><p>&quot;Yea. Rotates every thirty minutes or so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How long does the shift change take?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Five minutes, more than enough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. I've already ascertained Harrison's office location. On the second floor, all the way at the end on the right with the bronze handles and ox-ring door knocker.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it. What about the butler? He's too observant.&quot; One of the cleaners motioned towards the stern-looking butler, who was eyeing them intently but clearly out of earshot on the second floor.</p><p>&quot;I'll handle him, don't worry.&quot; Huriga winked.</p><p>With the break over, they continued cleaning, albeit at a much slower, methodical pace, intentional to a fault. Huriga kept his head low as he used a mop to scrub the tiles clean, though from the peripheral of his eyes, he could tell that the butler was getting frustrated.</p><p>By the next break, the butler was already descending the main staircases, making a beeline straight for Huriga. &quot;You're far too slow - the mansion must be cleaned by nightfall, and it's already lunchtime! I can see that some of your cleaners are clearly slacking in their work.&quot;</p><p>Huriga shrugged as he sipped on a flask of water. &quot;Well that's because we're not allowed to clean the other rooms yet. Too many cooks spoil the broth, we can't have that many cleaners in the main hall. If you want it to go faster, its better if I divide my cleaners up to tackle multiple areas at once.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Out of the question. Who would supervise you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Relax, relax. You're too stuck up - how long have you been holed up here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What does that matter to you-&quot; The butler leaned in close and sniffed Huriga's breath before recoiling in shock. &quot;Are you drinking wine right now?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing in the contract says anything about not being able to drink on the job. I'm still functioning. Just a sip to keep me going, you know how it is.&quot; Huriga swirled the wine in the flask, watching the butler's eyes tracing the flask intensely. &quot;Want some? It's good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As the head butler, I could never-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who's going to find out? Hmm? Look, have the whole flask.&quot; Huriga took a sip from the flask before handing it to the butler. &quot;I don't need it anymore - you need it more than me. You could drink this right now and be sober before your 'master' returns, and no one would be any the wiser.&quot;</p><p>The butler grasped the flask with both hands gleefully, though he carefully kept it close to his chest, stuffing it in his inner suit pocket out of sight of the patrolling guards. However, he soon felt something suspicious, as if Huriga had planned all of this. &quot;You're not going to poison me, are you?&quot;</p><p>Huriga chuckled with an incredulous look. &quot;Poison you? Are you insane? Where would I escape to if you were found dead? I don't even have a weapon to fight these guards!&quot; He jabbed his thumb over his shoulders to the fully armored guards decked out in arctech knight plates. &quot;And I drank the flask too! Look, if you don't want it, I'll-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll take it, I'll take it.&quot; The butler clutched his suit close. &quot;Your cleaners can go to the other rooms, but you're not allowed onto the second floor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, of course.&quot; Huriga waved to the butler as the butler retreated sheepishly before darting towards his accommodations further down the hallway, no doubt drinking the flask as soon as he could. <em>Looks like our client was right about the butler being an alcoholic. He'll be sleeping the rest of the night off. Maybe two. Can't have me sleeping now though.</em> He reached into his pockets and took out an antidote pill, popping it into his own mouth as he strolled back into the center of the main hall. He gave a hand sign to the cleaners, two of them following him immediately while the rest stayed outside and continued cleaning the main hall.</p><p>They marched down the first hallway with a cart of cleaning supplies, walking down all the way to the end towards a room before gingerly opening its door to reveal a standard library, hardly used, with its bookshelves still regularly dusted by the butler. There was no one within, and the room was illuminated by the two large windows that showed the exterior of the mansion.</p><p>Huriga began to unload the cleaning supplies, revealing a strange arctech machine that looked like a circular plate of sorts, its diameter wider than his shoulder's width by a good margin. One of the other cleaners brought a ladder; Huriga climbed it and placed the circular plate right on the ceiling, ascertaining the distance between the door and its placement. &quot;Ok, we're good. Synchronize watches.&quot;</p><p>All three of them took out a pocket watch, gathering around to fiddle their timings to be the same. &quot;When the minute hand hits five, crash the cart of cleaning supplies into the pillar or wall or something priceless.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You got it, bossman.&quot; The two cleaners left, leaving Huriga alone in the room as he took out an arctech fuel pack that had been disguised as a carton of soap, extending a dormant energy tube and plugging it into the very center of the circular plate. He waited patiently at the top of the ladder, counting down the seconds to go on his pocket watch. <em>Three, two, one...</em></p><p>He activated the fuel pack on the dot, the energy surging through the tube and powering the circular plate. A bright flash illuminated the circular plate, the edges grinding through the ceiling's material itself in a perfect circumference. At the exact same time, Huriga could even hear a loud crash in the main hall, prompting the guards to respond as soon as they could.</p><p>The butler, too, came out from his accommodation, wondering what all the fuss was about until he saw one of the cleaners coated entirely in soap, laughing it off with his fellow cleaners. With the guards standing around on high alert, the butler did not care too much any longer, deciding to retreat back to his abode once more to finish his half-drunk flask, his body becoming slightly lethargic.</p><p>Huriga held his breath; his ears perked for any approaching guards. When he was convinced no one was coming, he slowly lowered the circular plate, a perfect cutout of the ceiling and, subsequently, the floor of the room above. Carefully climbing down the ladder and placing the cutout on the ground, he clambered up again, this time reaching through the hole and pulling himself upwards.</p><p>The room above was pristine and immaculate, and the carpet was perfectly clean with no signs of tampering at all. Huriga cautiously observed every single facet of the office, the memory ingrained into his brain for when he needed to set everything back where it belonged. However, his attention was suddenly distracted by the near priceless relics that were mounted on stands within a golden display cabinet, his mouth instinctively drooling. <em>Jackpot!</em></p><p>He hurriedly lifted himself out of the hole, tiptoeing across the room towards the glass cabinet, keeping an eye out for any potential traps. As he reached the cabinet, he noticed a taut red wire strapping the glass cover down, the red wire leading somewhere unknown. Huriga knew if he snapped it, it could lead to something bad.</p><p>Instead of trying to avoid it, Huriga cracked his knuckles and took out a flat knife. Keeping a tight grip on the wire with one hand, he placed the knife on the surface of the glass cabinet before grabbing the other side of the red wire. He rubbed the center of the wire against the edge of the knife, slowly fraying it before it snapped. Just as it snapped, Huriga pulled hard as well, ensuring that the red wire stayed taut.</p><p>The entire cabinet jerked a little, the red wire seemingly connected to a trap door in the wall. Huriga carefully put both ends of the broken wire in his left hand while using his right to rummage through his pockets for a vial of horse glue, sticking the ends of the wire to the nearby wall and making sure it stayed taut. With the trap diffused, he carefully lifted the glass cabinet, the treasure right in front of his fingers.</p><p>He shoveled every relic of worth from the cabinet into a small sack, stuffing it full till it was bulging at the seams. As soon as he was done ransacking the entire cabinet, he quietly dropped the sack down the hole onto the ladder, himself clambering down as fast as he could, only to hear shouting from guards outside. &quot;Someone triggered the pressure plates in the main office!&quot;</p><p><em>What?!</em> Huriga didn't recall his client telling him anything about pressure plates. <em>Shit, it was a trap!</em> His mind raced, trying to come up with an alternative plan as he stuffed the sack in the cart. His two cleaners barged into the room, one of them still covered in a few soap bubbles. &quot;Bossman, they are coming here, fast! We need to hide!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck, there's no time to hide!&quot; Huriga cracked open the other cleaning supplies, revealing dismantled rifles that had been smuggled in, too. &quot;We'll be caught eventually - we have to break out!&quot;</p><p>The two cleaners hurriedly grabbed the parts from the cleaning supplies, assembling the rifle hastily. &quot;What about the others?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Screw them, we'll use them as bait to buy time! There's a backdoor we can get out from, come on!&quot; Huriga hurriedly left the hallway, instead spotting two armored guards already charging down the hallway towards them.</p><p>&quot;Dammit! Quick, out the window!&quot; Huriga reversed his course, rushing back into the library and smashing his way out through the window, the glass shards shattering and attracting all of the guard's attention.</p><p>The trio sprinted through the lawn, ignoring the calls to stop, and the pellets shot at them, running as hard as they could.</p><p>Inside the main hall, the other cleaners were stunned by what happened. They had been part of the operation, too, but were clearly left behind. Immediately, they began to scramble, trying to get out of the way. Some cracked open other smuggled weapons in a separate cart of cleaning supplies, using the rifles to fight back and hole themselves up in the rooms as the guards tried to force down the barricades. The butler stumbled out of his room, clearly drunk and intoxicated by the laced wine, staggering on his feet as he grabbed the nearest armored guard. &quot;What's going on?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The cleaners stole Harrison's collection!&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHAT?! Then what are you still doing here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But their accomplices are here in these rooms!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do they have the collection?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, sir, the thieves with the collection are running towards the complex now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? SEND EVERYONE TO GET THEM!&quot;</p><p>In the midst of all the chaos, no one noticed where the new girl had disappeared. With the guards chasing the escaping thieves and trying to pacify the remaining cleaners, she easily slinked her way towards the library, her movement suddenly as swift as a bird before she leaped upwards into the cutout hole in the ceiling, finding herself in Harrison's office.</p><p>The empty golden display cabinet hardly bothered her - instead she headed straight for Harrison's office table, where a stack full of documents were piled up. She filtered through the stack of paper, trying to find any critical information before holding her hand up to her neck, activating an engraving. [Sir, are you in range?]</p><p>[I am. Read out the documents to me.] Kyle's voice entered her brain directly. [Don't move the documents too much; we want all the blame to be pinned on the others.] Sasha was the perfect candidate because none of the documents would have been shifted, and it was as if Kyle himself was there. However, Kyle was naturally not going to endanger himself. Furthermore, if Sasha were to be caught, she would be unable to leak any secrets due to her being mute.</p><p>Sasha nodded and began reading all the information. Some of the blueprints were far beyond her understanding, but she methodically read each one of them out to Kyle. Many were letters of correspondence by Harrison to other dignitaries and company personnel, but surely enough, Kyle began to get a better picture of what Harrison was aiming for. [Sir, there's a letter from Count Leon to Harrison.]</p><p>[What does it say?]</p><p>[It says Count Leon will be attending the Grand Exhibition with a gift.]</p><p>[A gift...Are the Barons attending as well?]</p><p>[No. However, the Count of Kregol and the Count of Perlis have rejected the invitation.]</p><p>[Good information. Keep on searching. I need to know what else Harrison is planning to do in the Grand Exhibition.]</p><p>Most of the other documents were basic designs and scribbles of mathematical formula, something Sasha could hardly read out properly. Soon, she came across an interesting document. [Project Aurtla and Project Guryi are the main two showcases of the Grand Exhibition.]</p><p>[What?]</p><p>Sasha squinted her eyes, her brain reeling at the complexity of the blueprint. [There's no description for Project Aurtla, except it looks a little like a... tree? A tree with multiple fern-like branches sticking out, but the branches have no leaves. It's quite strange. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this. If anything, they look like blood vessels extending out from a trunk.]</p><p>[A tree with two branches... what about Project Guryi?]</p><p>[Project Guryi... says here that it will rival the heavens with a full suit of armor. I'm seeing drawings that look just like the armored arm of the Nest hitman that killed Gunther. ]</p><p>Kyle immediately fell into a silence. <em>This Harrison... he's planning to unveil a full exosuit?</em> He assumed that the exosuit would not be a Galactic Era one, but one that had been remodeled to function off Arcia instead, just like it had been for the prototype exosuit arm. Still, being able to construct the armour in its entirety was no small feat - Kyle needed to grab that information. [Where is the suit now?]</p><p>[Not stated here, I could-] Sasha swiveled her head towards the sound of approaching footsteps, getting closer and closer to the office. [Sir, I'm about to be compromised. Do I keep reading? ]</p><p>[No. Hide now and return when you're ready. You've done enough.]</p><p>She quickly slid back down the cutout hole, descending to the first floor of the library before dashing out of the room. With the guards still completely preoccupied with other cleaners fighting back, she could easily sneak out the back of the mansion and into an unguarded gardener's shed, where she crouched and waited patiently for nightfall before planning her escape.</p><p>At the far side of the complex, Kyle and Yona sat at a bench facing the road, watching wagons and pedestrians walk past. &quot;Judging from your expression, I assumed the plan worked. It was easy enough to drop an anonymous contract for Huriga to snatch up as long as he had the information. He wouldn't even think twice about who he's stealing from as long as it makes him rich.&quot; Yona smiled to herself, though she never made eye contact with Kyle. She had been the one to put up the contract deal and get Sasha to join Huriga, further emboldening him with information on the complex details.</p><p>&quot;Not until Sasha gets out,&quot; Kyle muttered. &quot;However I will admit your plan got me far more information than expected. This Grand Exhibition is going to be <em>very</em> interesting.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 112 - Preparations</strong></p><p><em>Two days later...</em></p><p>Wez panted as beads of sweat trickled down his forehead, his grimy hands shaking violently as he struggled to lift up the handles of the wheelbarrow in front of him, its content loaded with chopped wood. He could feel the coarse surface of the handle slip past his blistered, callous hands, the sharp edges tearing through his palm in a gash and unveiling old wounds earned over the last month.</p><p>&quot;Hey, whats the hold up?!&quot; A Nest guard shouted over the crashing gnashing sounds of large metal presses flattening freshly smelted steel out from a blackened furnace, rivers of slag coursing and hardening through a depressed trough while slaves like Wez use their tools and bare hands to pry apart the slag.</p><p>Wez swiveled his head quickly, noticing the long, tired queue of other slaves waiting for their turn, the vertical elevator in front of him already descending with a creaking sound, heralding the next batch of wood to be fed into the never-ending furnace. He watched in horror as the Nest guard stormed up to him, metallic boots clicking against the soot-covered floor of the sweatshop. &quot;Sorry, sir, I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get this cart moving now!&quot; The guard roared right into Wez's ears, deafening him. &quot;If you don't want to work, I'll give your meal to someone else!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, sir, sorry, I'll do it now!&quot; Wez summoned whatever strength he had left of his malnourished body, his once taut skin now dangling by his biceps as he knelt down and gritted his teeth to lift the cart by his shoulders, swapping over to his hands once the weight had been balanced on the rickety wooden wheel beneath.</p><p>&quot;Anyone else trying to slack under my watch will get their next two meals docked! Plenty of others hungry for your position!&quot; The guard scolded the rest of the slaves, all of whom kept their gaze low, unwilling to incite any beatings or thrashings. Wez himself hurried along the path, pushing the cart along a designated route that ran along the conveyor belt, steel bars, and beams passing him by in a blur as his eyes focused ahead, though his mind was already on the verge of breaking.</p><p><em>I deserve this...</em> Wez was a far cry from the haughty villager he was, regret welling in his heart for ditching the other villagers. He did not know that the foremen in the refugee camps of Ocra were actually slave traders, providing Nest with free labor to sell goods and production capacity to Harrison. The sweatshop was right beneath the military-industrial complex, though Wez doubted that any of the engineers and technicians above knew what was happening down here.</p><p>As Wez continued, he noticed there were significantly more guards than usual, while the slaves he passed were emotionless, their eyes staring into the distance. They operated billows, used arcia etching to reinforce steel armor plates meant for the frontlines, and operated heavy machinery to sand the edges down, all moving like clockwork on a never-ending schedule. Wez's mood was equally at rock bottom, feeling as if this was penance for him leaving Lisa behind. <em>If this could happen to me, then the villagers in the refugee camp, they...</em></p><p>He shook the thought out of his head instinctively, unwilling to consider what happened to the villagers. For all he knew, they could have been equally enslaved and raped, the children forced into dangerous work just like he saw in the sweatshop here. The slaves came from all over Versia, some even from places he had never even heard of. Not that anyone was willing nor had the energy to talk about the good old times without breaking out into tears.</p><p>As Wez's mind drifted, he failed to notice an uneven shallow ditch in the ground, the rickety wooden wheel falling in and causing the entire cart to topple onto its side. Even Wez was caught off-guard, his own body stumbling over face first and hitting the cart, injuring him. The resulting scatter of chopped wooden blocks alerted a nearby Nest guard while the slaves around all averted their gaze.</p><p>&quot;YOU! What the fuck?&quot; The Nest guard hollered, charging right toward him with an iron stick and immediately hitting the injured Wez right on the head. The impact temporarily disorientated Wez as he staggered onto all fours on the ground, using his hands to try and block the incoming strikes. The Nest guard's subsequent words were unintelligible to Wez as he was hit over and over again, blood from his skull coating his ears and vision, the world blurry in both sight and hearing. He cowered as each strike from the iron stick sent a jolting pain through his nerves, his body and limbs twitching while the guard rained blow after blow on him.</p><p>&quot;You there, pick up all the fallen blocks and cart them off! Furnace #4 needs it right now!&quot; The guard jabbed violently at another slave working the billows. The slave did not argue, immediately rushing to the fallen blocks and collecting them, ignoring the bleeding, groaning Wez on the floor.</p><p>Wez could feel his life ebb away, the pain from the wounds slowly becoming unregistered in his mind, as though they were never painful to begin with. <em>Lisa... Culo... Jakub... I...</em> He was about to give up the ghost when he realized that Lisa must still be in the refugee camp. <em>No, I have to make it up to them... I have to get out of here, I have to help them! I can't die just yet!</em></p><p>The guard swung the iron stick down once more, but this time, Wez caught it with his bare right hand, ignoring the shocking sting of the metal biting into his flesh, digging into the gash he had already gotten from the cart. The astonished guard was taken aback as Wez rose to his full height, towering over the guard, face covered in blood and arms red from the beatings, a fury unlike never before in his eyes despite his deteriorating muscles.</p><p>Without a word, Wez let out a battle roar, grabbing the jaw of the Nest guard with his other hand and squeezing with all his might, his iron grip from decades of woodcutting in the village coming to bear on the guard's chin. The guard mumbled incoherently, his voice muffled by the gritty soot-covered palm of Wez, a sickening cracking sound heard as Wez crushed the guard's jaw as hard as he could.</p><p>The other slave that was collecting the wooden block widened his eyes in shock as he watched Wez collapse the guard's jaw inwards. Blood and meat interspersed with teeth fell out of the guard's mutilated mouth with a plop onto the ground, the guard keeling over and letting out a horrible scream in pain. The scream echoed over the raging furnaces and din of metalworking, the slaves nearby all stunned by the sudden change in schedule.</p><p>&quot;I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!&quot; Wez slammed his knee into the guard's face, sending him sprawling. His life was now running on pure adrenaline, the blood thumping in his ears as his mind went into overdrive, looking for a way out. Unfortunately, the scream also attracted the attention of three Nest guards, who rushed over only to find the barrel of a handgun aimed right at them, wielded by the other slave who had taken the opportunity to grab the injured guard's equipment. Before any of the three could react, the slave fired everything he had, five pellets shrieking out through the air.</p><p>The pellets slammed into the guards, one killed instantly with his head pierced, the others maimed and injured as they scrambled out of the way, ducking and hiding behind machinery and other slaves at their workstations. The other slaves were equally panicking, wondering what to do next. Wez could see the hesitation in his eyes - but he did not need their help to choose what to do next.</p><p>With a battle cry, he charged forward with the iron stick gripped in his injured right hand, aiming for the nearest Nest guard. But before he could complete his third stride, a deafening explosion resounded through the sweatshop factory, echoes of metal crashing and superheated water bursting out in a thunderous rage across the walls and ceiling. Wez turned around to see a blinding light, one of the furnace's walls having been blasted apart by unknown forces with billowing smoke threatening to engulf the entire underground cavern, the light from mounted arctech lanterns already blanketed out by the growing wave of dust and dirt surging towards them.</p><p>Wez hurriedly shielded his eyes as the shockwave of air and gusts of smoke buffeted him, nearly toppling over as he felt the drying blood on his skin flicker off from the sheer force. The other slaves shouted and screamed as they took cover as well, crouching and hiding behind machinery as towering metal frames began to waver unsteadily while sounds of gunfire and fighting erupted in the distance.</p><p>&quot;It's a raid! It's a raid! The Ghosts of Versia are here!&quot; Rumors and cries carried over the air, reaching Wez and the slaves. Wez's heart surged with confidence, knowing that even if it was a hoax, it may be enough to galvanize the other slaves to action. Without hesitating any further, Wez charged towards the nearest disorientated Nest guard, slamming the tip of the iron stick right into his neck before forcibly twisting it off, the entire left side of the guard's neck left gushing with blood as he collapsed.</p><p>&quot;FREEDOM!&quot; Wez roared out through the smoke, his voice carrying over the unorganized screams and shouts. &quot;FREEDOM!&quot;</p><p>Some of the slaves blinked, their eyes filling with recognition as they began to attack their nearest Nest guards, using anything and everything they could find on hand. Arcia etchers, drill bits, and even ladders were utilized to fight against the guards, resulting in multiple gruesome deaths on both sides. The Nest guards were even more disorganized, one of the leaders trying to activate his arctech radio as he huddled behind a pillar: &quot;Reporting, Sweatshop at Section 46B is under attack! The Ghosts are here!&quot;</p><p>Instead of receiving a reply, there was nothing but static. The leader frantically tried to dial and tune the radio to another channel but found only blaring static on the radios. &quot;What's going on? I don't understand!&quot; Yet the leader soon found himself surrounded by slaves who had found his hiding location, Wez stepping forward with an iron stick in tow, blood dripping off its length.</p><p>&quot;Don't you try anything!&quot; The leader warned, slowly reaching behind his back to grab a holstered handgun. &quot;We're all working for the glory of Versia! Your labor is important to the country - don't you know that Raktor is about to attack us? Think about what you are doing!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know what we're doing - we're being exploited!&quot; One of the more uncouth slaves spat at the leader, but the leader had a grin on his face, already ready to pull out the handgun, when he suddenly felt an iron grip clasping his wrist from behind, arm locking him. A sharp kick to the back of his knee had him topple over, pinned down onto the ground while Wez stood in disbelief.</p><p>&quot;Lisa...?&quot; Wez mumbled as the throng of slaves rushed forward, wanting to take their chance to beat up the source of their pain for months, some even having been here for years. Yet Lisa used her free hand to pull out a rifle, aiming at the slaves gathering around and forcing them back.</p><p>&quot;We need him alive for our revenge! Anyone who tries to kill him will be shot on sigh- Wez?&quot; Lisa, too, was taken aback at the sight of the bloodied Wez. However, the sight of Lisa still alive and doing well caused Wez's adrenaline to plummet significantly, Wez finally noticing that he had a pellet wound in his stomach, the blood staining his meager slave clothing.</p><p>As he collapsed onto both knees, he saw Lisa rush up to him while two other armed Ghosts captured the leader. Lisa hurriedly popped a health potion vial, pouring it right over Wez's wounds, but there was too much blood loss for Wez to stay conscious any longer, his eyes struggling to stay open. Before Wez's vision faded, he could only see but not hear Lisa frantically shouting into an arctech radio mounted onto her shoulder.</p><p>@@@@@</p><p>Wez's eyes shot open with vigor, and he immediately tried to sit up, only to feel a terrible headache and a sharp, painful sting emerging from his guts. He found himself in a different room, a smaller underground room, though it was filled with the groans and moans of other injured slaves as well, all being treated by unknown strangers. He felt a thin fabric beneath his back, a bed with minimal cushioning, though far better than the hard floor he had been sleeping on in the sweatshop.</p><p>He tried again to move his arm, but he felt a gentle hand push him down, the owner of the hand sitting next to his bed and feeding him another health potion vial which soothed his aching head. &quot;Don't move, Wez. You're too injured for a single potion to heal in a day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lisa...&quot; Wez croaked, his voice dry as he gazed upon the familiar face of Lisa, though from her expression, it was clear that a lot had changed since their last meeting in the refugee camp. &quot;I... I'm sorry...&quot; He averted his gaze, unable to look Lisa right in the eyes.</p><p>&quot;I heard what you did today. There's nothing to be sorry about. Glad to see you're still willing to stand up and fight.&quot; Lisa smiled, patting Wez on the shoulder. &quot;How did you end up there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The foremen... he sold me at a dock in the tunnels...&quot; Wez's voice trailed off, his mind struggling to recoil from the horrible beatings and punishment he endured at the start. &quot;I tried to escape, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's okay, it's okay. You're safe now.&quot; Lisa comforted him, her head swiveling around. &quot;I'm going to go tell Culo that we saved you.&quot;</p><p>Wez nodded weakly, watching the confident Lisa move through the medical room, her posture and demeanor more decisive than ever. <em>She used to be a clueless girl, only in charge because of her father.</em> He was more surprised when he noticed others calling her for advice and orders, clearly in the leadership position. <em>What happened here?</em></p><p>Within a few hours, Wez recovered slowly, being fed health potions and stamina potions on a regular basis. He had raised clear objections against getting such potions, knowing that it was a luxury and an expensive one to have an Alchemist brew. Yet Lisa ignored him, only eventually bringing him out into the central chamber to show him around when he was well enough to walk.</p><p>The sight was astounding, with dozens of Ghosts and other logistic workers all moving, planning, and working in a central main chamber hall. Rations, potions, armor, and weapons were carted non-stop to and fro, new shipments being carried in on large sacks. Even children pulled their weight, taking care of other still injured slaves as well as fixing up torn clothing and sewing new bedding for the Ghosts. Wez could only stare in amazement at the tall stacks of potion crates, the potions numbering in the thousands while shelves were stocked with sealed water flasks, enough to flood a forest if they wanted to. &quot;What in the Goddess's name is happening here? Are you preparing for the end of the world?!&quot; Wez exclaimed to Lisa.</p><p>&quot;This? This is just one of our bases. There's four more like this across this layer.&quot; Lisa grinned with clear pride, having built up over the last few weeks. Fresh recruits from rescued slaves were familiarizing themselves with the Aspis MK2 repeater and poor arcia crystals, the training led by Feldon and a few other veteran Ghosts. In another training hall, they passed by, Sasha was drilling basic hand combat skills into the trained Ghosts, demonstrating by spars.</p><p>Deeper along the hallway was a row of arcia etching stations in yet another chamber. While it was not as massive as Wez's sweatshop, there was enough for a motley crew of a dozen arcia etchers to fix up any damaged engravings. Other chambers connected to the central chamber each had a designated role - administration, operations planning, ration and supply packing, and an engine room to power the lights and other machinery in the base. As Wez and Lisa walked past a room, he noticed a fearsome man step out from a doorway, his height slightly above Wez and with the air of a domineering leader. Wez could already feel an unknown pressure, intuitively knowing that he should never cross this man.</p><p>&quot;Lisa. Any issues with the jammer?&quot; Kyle spoke with gravitas, each word measured and straight to the point, his eyes stern.</p><p>&quot;No, sir. Worked perfectly.&quot; Lisa gave a slight salute, almost prompting Wez to salute as well out of a desire to fit in.</p><p>Kyle glanced at Wez, but summarily ignored him as unimportant. &quot;Good. I trust there's no issue with our radios then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, no interference at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perfect. And this is...?&quot; Kyle turned his attention to Wez.</p><p>&quot;My old childhood friend. He'll be an asset for us - a great fighter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Understood. I'll leave the training to you.&quot; Kyle walked past the two of them, and Lisa saluted again even though Kyle had not turned around.</p><p>&quot;Who was that?&quot; Wez whispered hastily to Lisa. &quot;He doesn't look like a Versian.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is the only reason why I am able to rescue you today and be in such a position.&quot; Lisa glowered with pride. &quot;That man will be the savior of Versia - whether or not he's at the front or at the rear. And it doesn't matter if he's Versian or not. Anyone willing to fight against the Versian state is someone I can work with.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You...&quot; Wez's eyes widened with realization. &quot;You're the Ghosts of Versia! How did-&quot;</p><p>&quot;We can reminisce about history later.&quot; Lisa brushed off Wez's question, leading him to another room where other healed slaves were gathered, all of them able-bodied men and women, some as young as 15. &quot;I need your help to fight. To fight as a Ghost against those who enslaved you. Are you in? Or are you going to run away like before?&quot;</p><p>Wez didn't even think twice, accepting Lisa's offer in a heartbeat with a firm handshake. &quot;I won't let you down again. I won't let anyone down anymore.&quot;</p><p>Lisa smiled, reaching out to give Wez a tight hug. &quot;I forgive you. Now don't die on me, and we'll get to go back to our village in due time.&quot;</p><p>Wez nodded, joining the group of fresh recruits. Not all who were rescued wanted to join, and thus, his group was clearly composed of strong motivation, grit, and desire. He could tell that some wanted revenge, others wanted to fight for justice, and others simply wanted to have the strength to stand up for themselves. For him, he saw this as redemption.</p><p>Over the next week, the training was grueling. They cycled and rotated through various regimens: weapon training course, physical combat, and mapping. They were barely allowed to sleep, though they were not as fatigued as they should have been, thanks to the non-stop usage of stamina potions that kept them going. The crash course was brutal and unforgiving, with some of the recruits unable to handle the mental strain and instead falling out to work as an etcher, scout, or supplier. Though their group started at two dozen, they were filtered down to just five by the end of the crash course.</p><p>Wez knuckled down, braving anything the Ghosts threw at them. Nothing the course did was worse than what he had experienced at the hands of the Nest guards, the beatings, whippings, and scars fresh on his skin and mind. He followed every instruction to the letter, the strenuous schedule forging him and honing him into a new Ghost. However, the training was only just that: training. In order for the fresh recruits to be accepted, they needed to be drilled in live combat.</p><p>At the end of the training week, Wez relaxed in a changing room, leaning against the wall as he sat on a thin bench, his other squad mates resting too and checking their gear. &quot;They should just let us have a go at some of the captured Nest prisoners. Let us fight them one on one.&quot; One of the fresh recruits that he had bonded with over the week-long training course spoke while dismantling his Aspis MK2 repeater, cleaning its parts and assembling it over and over again, drilling the motion into his head.</p><p>&quot;Feldon said they are too weak for us.&quot; Another replied as he polished his armor plate, checking the engravings for any bad grooves or dirt stuck. &quot;Supposedly they got something better for us to fight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, rats? I've already killed three skulking around the base. Actual rats, not those Nest rats.&quot; Yet another recruit joked, earning a wave of laughter through the changing room that was interrupted by Lisa stepping through the doorway.</p><p>&quot;Gear up. Your squad is moving out of the base as soon as possible. Full weapons and supplies. Gas masks, too. Geraldine will be your lead.&quot; Lisa gave the order with a matter-of-fact tone before leaving. Wez didn't hesitate, scrambling to his locker like the others and putting on his gear, his muscle memory checking each and every facet of the loadout. He slotted a thick armor plate into a woven fabric vest, masking it and then slinging the repeater's sling over his shoulder, donning a simple helmet, and moving out.</p><p>As soon as all of them were organized in the changing room, the veteran Ghost Geraldine came and led them towards the very end of the hallway, past barricade, barbed wires, and defensive repeaters mounted and connecting to pulsating arcia fuel packs. Most of the recruits' minds were already bursting at the seams with questions about where they were going, but their training had them drilled into the hierarchy, keeping their mouths shut.</p><p>Wez found himself descending a cramped tunnel leading into a large rectangular corridor that was already well-lit. As Geraldine had them march down the corridor, he noticed other logistic workers carting wheelbarrows filled with poor arcia crystals, stuffed into sacks that were subsequently hauled up to the main base itself. <em>Where the hell are we going?</em></p><p>His answer came soon enough as soon as they reached the end with Geraldine waving her hand outwards. &quot;Welcome to the Rotten Cave. This is where we collect all of your poor arcia crystals that you use in the Aspis MK2 Repeater.&quot;</p><p>The recruits stared in shock at the towering pillars of trash, the smell already causing some of them to gag. One of the recruits could not handle it, vomiting a little in her mouth underneath her gas mask. In the distance, there were sounds of fighting, and other squads of Ghosts were also doing their own apparent training.</p><p>&quot;You'll be killing rock spiders - quota is 100 crystals for the whole squad before you are allowed to return. I'll be assisting only if your life is in danger.&quot; Geraldine warned them. &quot;And I can only react so fast.&quot;</p><p>The recruits nodded, the squad gingerly stepping through the new environment. Some places already had poles with mounted arctech lanterns providing bright light on top of the already bioluminescent fungi and flora scattered around the area. Wez looked at another returning squad, their armor and gas masks coated in black icky goo from head to toe, while one of them had a gaping hole in their legs.</p><p>Within minutes, Wez's squad was thrown into the fray, delving deeper into the cave to find a horde of rock spiders numbering in the dozens charging at them. Their training kicked in, though some of them flustered a little. Yet, thanks to the firepower of the repeater, they were able to easily tear through the rock spider armors without breaking a sweat. The original fear had begun to dissipate, and Wez, too, found newfound confidence in dealing with the rock spider over an hour.</p><p>However, suddenly, a tremor rumbled through the cave, originating from the far horizon beyond where the Ghosts have explored, the darkness enveloping the view ahead with no mounted arctech lantern poles. Wez squinted his eyes, seeing a large shadow rushing towards them, smacking its way through piles of trash and refuse. Behind the squad, Geraldine's face paled beneath her gas mask, frantically shouting to the squad. &quot;It's a noxious salamander! Quick, retreat!&quot;</p><p>The squad had never trained for this, and they began to panic, some rooted to their feet. Wez began to run, but noticed one of the recruits standing still, frozen in fear while the maw of the salamander slowly came into view, illuminated by the glow around as it lunged towards the stunned recruit. Wez himself charged forward, tackling the recruit out of the way as the salamander's maw crashed into the ground, only gulping mud.</p><p>As the salamander's beady eyes turned to face Wez and his squadmate still struggling to get up from the sludge, Geraldine quickly ordered the squad to open fire, the barrage distracting the salamander briefly. The gap allowed Wez to pull his squadmate up to his feet, the two escaping while the salamander recoiled from the withering fire.</p><p>However, the Aspis MK2 repeater could only fire so long. Within a minute, the canisters went dry, Geraldine picking up the rear as the squad beat a hasty retreat. Geraldine frantically spoke into an arctech radio. &quot;Contact! Contact with salamander!&quot;</p><p>As soon she had said the words, a sonic boom erupted through the cave, a single projectile tearing through pillars of trash and hitting the salamander right on its snout. Instead of it deflecting, the projectile ripped into the flesh easily, lodging itself right in the very center of its head before its skin began to bulge erratically, a dull muffled explosion inside that caused bodily fluids to burst out of its orifices.</p><p>The sonic boom frightened the squad, even causing Geraldine to take cover, unsure of what had just hit them until Kyle's smooth voice came in over the radio. [Hit confirmed, Sasha. Salamander eliminated. Proceed with resupply and resume training.]</p><p>Geraldine stared in shock at the dying salamander before looking up to see Kyle perched on the top of a pile of trash, observing them quietly. He was apparently giving orders to Sasha, who wielded a long pole of sorts embedded with basic arcia crystals, which could be loaded with a strange pellet that Geraldine had never seen before. &quot;Y-yes, sir!&quot; She scampered to her feet, hastily urging the squad to go back to the start.</p><p>Kyle didn't pay the retreating squad any mind, focusing on his own practice. &quot;Looks like the improved railgun should be enough to pop a human head.&quot;</p><p>[Sir, I think it'll do more than that. This railgun could destroy anything.] Sasha replied telepathically.</p><p>&quot;I doubt that.&quot; Though Kyle had clearly improved the railgun beyond its former strength, he somehow felt that Harrison would have something up his sleeve for certain. &quot;How's the handling?&quot;</p><p>[Hard. The recoil is immense. I doubt any other Ghost would be able to handle this gun.]</p><p>&quot;Then we don't have a choice. You'll be the designated sniper for the exhibition.&quot;</p><p>After they had completed their practice run, Kyle and Sasha returned to the base. With only a week left to the exhibition, Kyle had been working day and night to improve his chances of stealing the exosuit. The Ghosts of Versia now numbered two hundred in total, forming an effective rebel strike group that could raise havoc anywhere he wanted. Originally, he wanted to attack Harrison at the Grand Exhibition, but it was a risky maneuver, especially when there were inklings of an exosuit being brought up. Despite Sasha's infiltration, Yona's understanding, and the training of the Ghosts, it was not enough information for Kyle to truly ascertain the level of defense and firepower that he was dealing with. He could not determine if Harrison had perfected the arcia exosuit or not, making it a blind attack at best. <em>Until I steal the exosuit and use it to make my own, I cannot guarantee a complete win.</em></p><p>If he brutishly launched an attack, Nest and the military would be sure to come charging down to kill them in full force. Kyle wondered whether it would be worth it but eventually decided not to. &quot;Our main objective is to steal any technological innovations Harrison has on display - nothing more. Despite our progress in developing the rebel movement, it would be foolhardy to fight a civil war now.&quot; Kyle explained his revised plan to the others, holding a meeting in the operations room.</p><p>&quot;So just a simple in-and-out, fast and quick. Are you sure, though?&quot; Yona warned. &quot;This could be your last chance to see Harrison - when the war begins, he might be holed up in a bunker somewhere even I don't know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The start of the war will lessen the pressure we face and also allow us to continue building our strength,&quot; Kyle replied.</p><p>&quot;I agree. Two hundred fighters is hardly enough to occupy even just the Versian parliament if we wanted to. The guards in there alone already number two hundred - it's too risky to try anything now. We'll just have to find Harrison later in the chaos of the war. Eventually, he would slip up.&quot; Dekar nodded.</p><p>&quot;We should attack now.&quot; Lisa disagreed vehemently, jabbing at the map of Tenar. &quot;Even if our strike fail, we have plenty of backups and escape routes to make sure the movement survives.&quot; She pointed out the different tunnels that had been scouted out thanks to the clearing of the Rotten Cave. &quot;We can easily evacuate to Desham or Creuliz, depending on which base we're being attacked from.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Once we evacuate, there might be no coming back. This means we would lose everything we've built here. It would be impossible to ferry everything of worth out of the bases just on our backs alone.&quot; Feldon countered. &quot;If I were Nest, the moment I find out about the extent of the third layer and fourth layer, I would do everything in my power to clamp down any entrances or exits, maybe even collapse them! If we leave to Desham, we will lose access to Tenar, which is the seat of power.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The plan is final. Next week, the Ghosts of Versia will infiltrate the Grand Exhibition and steal everything of worth. Our main target is Project Aurtla and Project Guryi, which are reported to be displayed in these two buildings. Under no circumstances can we reveal that it is the Ghosts who stole it. Yona will put out a few more anonymous contracts for such a heist to mask our movements.&quot; Kyle concluded. &quot;Sasha will be working as oversight with the new railgun in case we are compromised. All Ghosts will be positioned at their designated location, ready to strike in any scenario. Understood?&quot;</p><p>The rest of the leaders nodded in unison, though Lisa still had a question, raising her hand. &quot;Sir, if Sasha is acting as oversight, who is actually stealing the Projects?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 113 - Grand Exhibition (1)</strong></p><p>A booming crescendo of fireworks, confetti, and music blasted through the air, showering the attendees of the Grand Exhibition in dazzling colors and displays under the clear blue sky. The streets of Tenar were filled with joy, school children running up to the entrance with anticipation, and Versians from all over the nation gathering in one single spot to partake in the festivities.</p><p>The entire main street leading up to the central square beneath the statue of President Johan had been cordoned off, its sidewalks now repurposed to feature pop-up stalls and carts of all kinds, selling mysterious candy, sweets, and delicacies from far beyond. Sellers and performers alike called out to the bustling crowd, attracting attention to their acts and wares.</p><p>&quot;Rock candy, salted straight from the Mines of Tryas! Even the Emperor couldn't help letting everyone try it out!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The dazzling Miss Shark hailing from the Fifth Island of Proco - half lady, half shark, all violence!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Behold, the three-horned ram of Ulut! Its dazzling rainbow wool puts other animals to shame, able to fan it out to attract other males through perilous dances on the tip tops of the mountain ranges! It is famed for its tenacity through harsh weather conditions, as well as an uncanny ability to mimic human words when you say his name!&quot; A circus performer regaled his audience with colorful descriptions of the various oddities from around Versia held behind cages., prompting a kid to walk up and participate. &quot;Go on, say his name!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhm...&quot; The kid looked around confusedly, the apple candy already melting in his hand, about to drip onto his checkered sleeves. &quot;I don't know his name.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's right here, on his collar.&quot; The performer pointed out a tag on the Ulut ram, who was cheerfully gnawing away on a trough of blue leaves, its eyes staring blankly ahead at the audience gathered around.</p><p>&quot;Oh! Oink Oink!&quot; The kid laughed. &quot;That's a funny name.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oink yourself, dumb twat.&quot; The ram blurted out in the tone of a gnarly farmer with a sneer on its face, belaying its intelligence, before its expression returned to a vacant look just as before. The crowd rolled in laughter, the kid still stunned by the sudden outburst before he began to sniffle, running back to his parents.</p><p>Elsewhere on the streets, merchants tried to show off mysterious wares with tall properties while explorer groups laid out relics discovered from the depths of Versia, some even showing off their amazing abilities to an amazed crowd. &quot;This relic right here is the pinnacle of our haul in our decades of ruin-diving. Behold an object so magnificent and dazzling that when one peers into it, it's as though you can see the stars beyond the veil, beyond this mundane reality! Give it a shot yourself, free of charge!&quot; One old explorer waggled a tube-like object with a lens attached to it. &quot;Do be careful - whatever you look at might feel a little tingle of sorts.&quot;</p><p>Some of the more adventurous men stepped up, grabbing the tube from the old explorer and looking around, their jaws dropping in its amazement. &quot;My goodness... this... this is like peering through walls! I can see beyond!&quot; The first user exclaimed with shock, aiming the tube at the crowd. &quot;I can see so much... it's like a brand new world!&quot; The lens of the tube aimed right at a few of the ladies in the crowd, all of whom could suddenly feel an unknown heat erupting all over their skin, as if they were being irradiated by an unknown source stemming from men who were clearly grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Festival games, singing, dancing, and performances all distracted each and every attendee, and the entrance to the Grand Exhibition was completely free of charge. All Versians of any age and origin could attend, with a significant crowd already gathering in the central square, enjoying the various amenities and delicacies around. Beyond the central square laid the steps that led up to a repurposed justice court, once used for trialing errant nobles after the war, now converted by the government into a museum and subsequently used for the Grand Exhibition as a banquet hall.</p><p>Inside the banquet hall, whose doors were still closed, servants and waiters alike scrambled around frantically, preparing tables and chairs and decorating pillars to welcome the approaching dignitaries. The colors of Versia and its coat of arms were displayed prominently, and the banners and other flags propped up along the ceiling and walls made it look grand. Coupled with the intricately brilliant marble tiles and the opulent revolutionary paintings by former revolutionaries spanning the entire ceiling of the converted justice court, it gave a sense of awe and inspiration to any within it.</p><p>However, the waiters did not have time to soak in the atmosphere, rushing to and fro to setup the cutlery and silverware for each of the tables, placing placards on some of the circular dining tables situated near a stage which used to be the judge's seat. Tens of dozens of cutlery sets were arranged methodically and precisely, a few managers walking through and fixing any mistakes the waiters made.</p><p>&quot;Don't any of you dare to drop your damn fucking drinks! I swear to the Goddess, if you stain ANYONE's suit or dress, I will have you quartered the next day in this very same place and make you clean up your own guts! Are we clear?!&quot; The banquet hall's manager roared, the waiters nodding back in unison. &quot;Good. Get into position!&quot;</p><p>The waiters filtered out to various corners of the halls, standing next to tables and pillars while an honor guard formed at the entrance of the banquet hall, their uniforms decorative in nature, presenting the colors of the revolutionary guard. They all stood still, listening to the din of the crowd and the cheers of the people beyond the closed doors.</p><p>Amidst the waiters who stood at attention, one of them was Kyle himself, having disguised his facial features thanks to Haui's makeup. This time, he did not use the warts or acne one, instead using a lighter one that gave him freckles, as well as making his chin slightly more dirty in nature, just enough to throw anyone who would recognize him off, his hairstyle also changing drastically. His eyes glanced around the hall, mapping the area out while his eyes caught the gaze of a few stationed Nest guards scattered around the hall.<em>There's a hundred waiters here, not to mention Nest guards. Let's not try anything funny here.</em></p><p>[Announcing the arrival of Acting President Mornero!] A muffled announcer voice spoke from outside, drowned out by the cheers of the countless Versians gathered along the road and the entrance of the banquet hall to see him. Soon, Kyle saw him enter the banquet hall, the honor guard at full attention and saluting him with honor.</p><p>It was Kyle's first time actually seeing Mornero in the flesh. He donned a proper black suit, a neat little pin with the flag of Versia attached to his suit's pocket, along with a well-folded blue handkerchief tucked in nicely. Though Morneo himself wasn't very tall, he had a somewhat familiar gait in the way he walked, giving Kyle an uncanny feeling as though he had met him somewhere else before. Most noticeably, his nose gave Kyle a strong sense of deja vu, though Kyle was struggling to find a connection to anything that had happened to him before. <em>Something isn't right. I shouldn't have seen this man before. Why does it feel like I've worked with him before? Is he from my former life?</em></p><p>While Kyle ran through all the possible ex-employees in his former life's criminal group, he could not figure out anyone who looked like him. When Mornero's gaze swept the banquet hall, Kyle pointedly averted his eyes, acting like he was focusing on the ceiling, the painting depicting the tumultuous final battle of the revolutionaries taking over the parliament, led by President Johan himself. If Kyle squinted his eyes, he could just barely make out the painted visage of Dekar, his expression locked in a battle cry leading the troops.</p><p>Mornero did not leave the banquet hall yet, standing right near the honor guards and preparing to welcome the incoming foreign and local dignitaries himself. Sure enough, one by one, diplomats and representatives from all over the world began to stream in by the dozens, the Grand Exhibition having attracted a lot of attention. Kyle watched as even a city mayor from Creuliz received a personal handshake from Mornero himself. <em>Interesting. They know how to sell themselves to the people.</em></p><p>&quot;Hey, what the fuck are you waiting for? You got to start serving drinks!&quot; A manager smacked Kyle in the back, almost prompting Kyle to turn around and twist the manager's head off. However, he relented, swallowing his pride and moving off without a word, perfectly balancing a tray of champagne glasses in one hand and moving through the banquet hall floor.</p><p>Soon, the banquet hall was filled up with nearly five hundred guests. Kyle tracked as many faces as he could, but he could not immediately tell who they were and where they were from. He had their faces recognized bit by bit, knowing that there would come a time when he would need to use them. From the corner of his eye, he silently tracked Mornero and who he talked to, all the while expertly handing glasses and sweets to nearby guests. Each move Kyle took was measured, slowly allowing him to get closer and closer to Mornero.</p><p>As Kyle approached, he suddenly noticed a gaze locked onto him from a bodyguard near Mornero. It took three minutes of him playing it cool until the bodyguard finally relented, looking elsewhere. He took the opportunity to glance at the bodyguard once more. Unlike the rest of the Nest guards clearly angling around the president, this one was clad in a full armor suit that left no obvious gaps, the surface a smooth metallic black that gave an eerie sense of speed despite its apparent weight. On the center of his chest plate was the emblem of Nest engraved prominently, while arctech engravings dominated the rest of the armor, the grooves and edges sleek and dangerous.</p><p>&quot;Are we sure there won't be any Ghosts attacking today?&quot; Mornero murmured to that bodyguard during a lull between dignitaries' arrival, Kyle's keen hearing able to pick it up even though he was not looking directly at them.</p><p>&quot;No, sir, not to our knowledge. Our men have everything under control.&quot; The bodyguard replied in a hushed tone, earning a scoff from a lady nearby, irking him slightly. &quot;Do you have something to say, General Verian?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; The lady arranged medals of honor on her military uniform, which were countless awards for her acts of valor in the independence war fifteen years ago. Her face bore multiple scars, her gaze unafraid of anyone, not even Acting President Mornero himself. &quot;I just wonder whether Nest is losing its touch. Didn't you just get another sweatshop attacked?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are not having this discussion here.&quot; Mornero intervened immediately, cutting the conversation short. &quot;I will not have you two bickering - reputation is at stake here. Nox, secure the VIP room once more. General Verian, be nice to our guests. No fighting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Kyle peeked from the peripheral of his vision, tracking the bodyguard Nox, who moved towards a luxurious door embedded in the wall, clearly meant for more important visitors. [Sasha, anything happening?]</p><p>[Nothing I see yet, sir. No sign of Harrison.]</p><p>[Do you have a clear line of sight to the VIP room?]</p><p>[Affirmative. I can see all the chairs.] Sasha tweaked the scope of the railgun, perched precariously on the rooftop of an adjacent building nearly three blocks away, her vantage point allowing her a good view of the situation.</p><p>[The moment you catch a glimpse of his convoy, I need to know immediately. ] Kyle ended the conversation, focusing his efforts on preparing to infiltrate the VIP room. He knew it would be where he would ascertain the most information, as well as allow him to eavesdrop on Harrison. Just as he was checking out the security that was guarding the VIP's door entrance, he felt a light tap on his shoulder.</p><p>&quot;Could I have that drink you're carrying?&quot; A familiar voice caused Kyle to jolt in shock, a first since he had ever arrived at Raktor. Instead of turning around fully, he only plucked the glass of wine from the tray he carried, handing it to the person behind him while averting his gaze. <em>What the fuck is he doing here?! Wasn't he supposed to be in Kregol?</em></p><p>&quot;Hey, Sebastian! You got to try this bread, its wicked. It's blue and everything!&quot; A loud booming voice cheerfully called towards the man behind Kyle, Kyle realizing that both Sebastian and Ares Ulras were attending the Grand Exhibition too. Kyle soon noticed other major gang leaders also attending, all of whom he recognized - he had to if he wanted to know who to avoid or work with. <em>Bolsh Legion, Veiled Angels, Violet Demons, Tul'e Da'li - everyone is here.</em> While Kyle felt slightly irked that his Seven Snakes gang was not invited, it was clear that only major gang leaders were invited.</p><p>Most of the other delegates kept a clear distance away from the unruly bunch, though Sebastian squinted his eyes in suspicion at Kyle, wondering why the waiter was trying so hard to look away. &quot;You seem familiar... have we met before?&quot; Sebastian queried.</p><p>Kyle put on his best alternate accent voice, mimicking a young, frightened boy. &quot;Sorry, sir, I don't know. I'll have to leave now.&quot; He hurried away, acting like he had to refill the tray with drinks while Sebastian stared at his back.</p><p>[Sasha, you didn't tell me that the major gangs were here too!]</p><p>[Sorry, sir, I was focused only on looking out for Harrison.]</p><p>Kyle let out a deep breath, this time making sure to avoid getting close to the major gang leaders in any way. Despite their clearly delineated territories back at Raktor, surprisingly, they were all cordial and friendly with each other, Kyle noticing Sebastian and Ares chatting happily with the other leaders. <em>Looks like they are working together - but to what end?</em></p><p>Sasha's frantic voice suddenly surged into his mind once more. [Sir, I see Harrison's convoy approaching now, but there's someone ahead of him.]</p><p>[Who?]</p><p>[Count Leon is here, with what seems like a prisoner wagon. I am not too sure.]</p><p><em>It must be the delayed handover of Versian prisoners.</em> Kyle quickly used the distraction as the dignitaries and guests alike all turned their heads to watch the arrival of Count Leon at the steps of the banquet hall. He noticed Nox had already taken up position next to Mornero near the front, while two Nest guards watched over the door to the VIP room. Acting fast, he hurriedly grabbed a set of silverware from a nearby unoccupied table, rushing over with the tray in hand and looking flustered.</p><p>The two Nest guards immediately blocked his path, their rifles aimed at him. &quot;Where the hell do you think you're going?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry, sirs, I was told by the manager to set up the cutlery!&quot; Kyle explained with a jittery voice.</p><p>&quot;Someone else already set up the table, it's done.&quot; The guard asserted, nudging Kyle back with the rifle.</p><p>&quot;There's been a late addition to the guest list - Sir, please, if the manager finds out I didn't do my job...&quot; Kyle pleaded, the guard sighing and finally relenting, opening the door for him to reveal a quaint little room, a dining table fit for just five people. However, the moment Kyle entered, he tripped over his own foot, collapsing onto the floor with the cutlery flying all over, the silverware clattering onto the neatly arranged table in a mess.</p><p>The sound caused a few guests to turn their heads, and the guard quickly closed the door to prevent anyone else from looking in. &quot;Clean that fucking mess up, quick!&quot; The guard whispered from outside, clearly agitated.</p><p>&quot;Y-yes, sir!&quot; Kyle grinned and got to work. He easily rearranged the table back to its original setup, not leaving any hints that it had been tampered with. Sliding his hand into his pockets, he retrieved a modified arctech radio, adhering it with horse glue to the bottom of the table. &quot;Testing, one, two.&quot;</p><p>[Loud and clear, sir.]</p><p>[Try making a sound back.]</p><p>No sound came from the modified arctech radio, altered to only transmit sound that picked up, effectively working like a listening device that would allow Kyle to spy on the conversation. The radio would transmit to Sasha, who would then repeat the words into Kyle's brain via telepathy. &quot;Good.&quot;</p><p>[Announcing the arrival of Count Leon as well as Mr. Harrison!] The same muffled announcer's voice prompted Kyle to clean up after himself. He quickly grabbed the tray and scampered out of the room, but not before apologizing vehemently to the two Nest guards, who felt a slight bit of pity for him. With his task done, Kyle was planning to leave the banquet hall and ditch his waiter uniform until he caught sight of both Count Leon and Harrison entering together, accompanied by Acting President Mornero.</p><p>Count Leon wore the same blue noble colors he had worn when he met Kyle, while Harrison had his own blonde hair combed backward neatly into a ponytail, and instead of wearing a suit, he wore an inventor's coat, his pockets filled to the brim with eccentricities and other oddities, even featuring a full toolset on a work belt. Kyle didn't recall Harrison looking like this in the advertisement; his outfit was far more elegant than in the marketing light-thrower images. Here, Harrison portrayed a more homely feel, as if he were just an engineer working for Versia.</p><p>Kyle felt something strange from the way the two were acting with one another, especially for two rival powers supposedly on the cusp of war. Count Leon abandoning his military exercise to attend this Grand Exhibition would naturally be seen as a de-escalation of tensions by the general public at large. <em>What the hell is actually going on?</em> Kyle decided to stay for a bit longer, just to see if he could gleam any more information. Once he ditched his waiter role, it would be nearly impossible to re-enter once more.</p><p>[And now, I would like to invite Acting President Mornero to give a speech for the opening ceremony of the Grand Exhibition!] A cheerful lady hosted the stage of the banquet hall, and the guests politely applauded while Mornero adjusted his suit and walked up the stage with firm determination. He tapped the microphone behind a podium emblazoned with the emblem of Versia, the echo reverberated even outside where arctech speakers had been linked in sequence, allowing his voice to reach the whole of the Exhibition.</p><p>Thanks to the marketing and advertising by Harrison, almost every Versian around the state was listening in on their own radios, even those working in Raktor stopping their jobs to sneak a quick listen in. Back in the Seven Snakes, Keith and the rest of the vipers were also carefully listening in, knowing that this was an important event that would reveal some of the plans at hand.</p><p>&quot;My fellow Versians. It has been fifteen years since we declared the independence of Versia. It brings me joy to be able to stand before all of you today to enjoy the fruits of what our forefathers and ancestors have fought tooth and nail for. Today, the day shines its light upon a brand new Versia, full of vitality and strength, ready to herald in a new age.&quot; Mornero spoke with dignity, his voice passionate.</p><p>&quot;This Grand Exhibition serves as a candle in a dire time, even when we find ourselves besieged by the realities of life. In an era where men seek to dominate everything they see, Versians throughout the nation, far and near, can stand together in this single event and look at their fears in the eye and say: 'Not today.'&quot;</p><p>&quot;For today is a day of celebration, of dignity, of fortitude. Versia is a democratic republic, its government born by the people, for the people. Our revolution may have succeeded when we first toppled the nobility, but it is still not finished - our society is not yet perfect. There are problems still to solve, and those who seek our ruin lurk about, planning our demise. I am glad that today, only friends of Versia have gathered here to join us in this monumental event. We thank each and every one of our most esteemed guests for participating.&quot;</p><p><em>Friends of Versia? That's rich.</em> Kyle glanced at Count Leon and Harrison, who did not seem to react in any way to Mornero's speech.</p><p>&quot;Each and every Versian has worked hard to bring to fruition this Grand Exhibition, a showcase of the ingenuity and talent that our precious people have to offer. Today, you will witness the grandeur and might of everything the people have in their hands! Versia, forward!&quot; Mornero clenched his fist, shooting it out.</p><p>&quot;VERSIA, FORWARD!&quot; The citizens of Tenar chanted back before breaking out into a raucous applause that seemed to encompass the entirety of the city.</p><p>&quot;Right now, I would like to invite Harrison, the sponsor of the Grand Exhibition, to say a few words.&quot; Mornero motioned to Harrison, who surprisingly did not take to the stage, but instead began to walk towards the entrance.</p><p>Ushers and guards began to have the guests walk out of the banquet hall onto its grand steps, taking a spot along its length to face the large cheering crowd gathered in the central square beneath the towering statue of President Johan. Unconventionally, Harrison had a microphone handed to him, the wireless arctech radio carrying his voice to the speakers effortlessly as he descended the stairs, his arms waving frantically to the crowd which jostled back in response, the front row squashing against a string of Nest guards and barricades to try and touch Harrison.</p><p>&quot;My fellow Versian comrades, esteemed guests.&quot; Harrison began, a wide smile on his face. &quot;This Grand Exhibition is to show off what all Versians have achieved, inventions galore. However, what good would be an invention if it were not Grand? Surely it would not fit the name of the event! Yet today I promise that what you see next, will have your eyes widen beyond belief.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For centuries, countless attempts by other inventors have tried and failed to reach the heavens. They said we would never be able to reach the same heights where wyverns and dragons rule.&quot; Harrison spoke with a low tone, a rumbling sound erupting in the air above that sounded like a charging train. The guests clearly looked around in panic at the source of the rumbling, and even Sebastian and Ares looked confusedly at the sky from which the sound was coming.</p><p>&quot;Look, over there!&quot; Someone in the crowd pointed towards the distance, where five tiny specks of black dots were growing quickly in their field of view. Many were rooted to the spots, while others excitedly bickered about what was happening.</p><p>&quot;Behold! The first known controllable artificial flight, fully powered by arcia engravings alone!&quot; Harrison did a bow in front of the guests, as the five specks of black dots expanded into large planes that swerved past in a blur. They zoomed away, splitting up from each other and leaving behind streaks of smoke while the deafening sound blanketed the crowd, the gusts rushing through. Kyle nearly dropped his tray in shock when he heard the familiar sound and saw the planes swoop by; the second time, he had been astonished.</p><p>[Sir, that's the tree drawing I saw! It's Project Aurtla!] Sasha exclaimed via telepathy.</p><p>&quot;While other countries may have already achieved such flight through the use of relic ruins, this is the first native engineering design, fully replicable for mass production!&quot; Harrison announced. &quot;With this in our hand, the skies will be ruled by us, and allow us to dominate any enemy that we may encounter, even a swarm of wyverns if it came down to it!&quot;</p><p>Already, the guests were all exclaiming in amazement, while the people were losing their minds over the second flyover as the planes once again zoomed past at a low altitude, threading the needle between buildings and leaving the attendees astonished all over the city. Kyle snapped himself out of his stupor, hurriedly finding a secluded exit to ditch his waiter uniform, revealing a simple civilian outfit beneath as he donned a peaked cap, melding into the crowd easily and heading straight for the designated location of Project Guryi.</p><p>Before he left, he glanced at the guests who were returning to the banquet hall, his sight locked on Count Leon. Despite the tremendous display and insinuation by Harrison of the firepower the planes could bring to bear, Count Leon looked happier than ever, as if the planes being introduced were a good thing. On the other side, reporters and journalists swarmed Harrison, trying to get his take on the newly unveiled invention even while he retreated back into the banquet hall. [Sasha, can you hear the VIP room?]</p><p>[It's still working, sir.]</p><p>[Good. I want to know every single word that is spoken.]</p><p>[On it.]</p><p>Kyle weaved and snuck his way past the now riled-up crowd, the enthusiasm and patriotism at an all-time high. <em>With such an unveiling, it might be even harder to recruit potential rebels now.</em> With air superiority now being a concern, it felt that the imminent war with Raktor was uncertain. Kyle felt that there was a real chance that Versia could easily win the battle in a first strike, assuming Count Leon had nothing to deal with the planes. <em>Perhaps that smile is because he has a countermeasure. Point defense engravings?</em></p><p>[Harrison and Count Leon just entered the room.]</p><p>Kyle didn't react, so he focused on his task ahead. Project Guryi was to be on display in one of the nearby buildings, a converted warehouse that was now filled to the brim with visitors, already examining the various types of industrial machinery placed within glass boxes, preventing anyone from touching them. He filtered in easily, the security letting anyone through.</p><p>[Count Leon congratulated Harrison on the planes.]</p><p>[I want to hear the exact words.] Kyle glanced from side to side, noting down the clearly heightened level of security. More than three dozen Nest guards were scattered around the warehouse, covering each and every viewing angle. A metal walkway positioned far above allowed them to get a bird's eye view of the crowd at large, though none of them could spot Kyle in the middle of it all.</p><p>He acted nonchalant, as though he was extremely interested in an automatic sewing machine and reading its description placard. Instead, he was listening to Sasha's recitation of what was going on in the VIP room.</p><p>&quot;Perfect display, indeed. I apologize for the Duke’s rejection, he has other more important things to attend to. Recently he has been a little… erractic in his behavior. It took a good amount of convincing for him to allow me to hold the military exercise.&quot; Count Leon praised as he took his seat inside the VIP room, sitting across from Harrison and Mornero.</p><p>&quot;No worries, please send our best regards to the Duke.&quot; Mornero nodded his head in acceptance. &quot;Though, its clear that we should talk about pressing matters than simply exchanging pleasantries.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. As previously agreed with your former... Minister Dekar, all Versian prisoners from the Ilysian Punks shall be transferred to you. General Javel has been kept well and alive.&quot; Count Leon leaned back, more confident than ever.</p><p>[Sasha, do you have eyes on General Javel?]</p><p>[I do, he's still in the wagon. I can see him through the window grills.]</p><p>[Keep an eye on him.] Kyle spoke as he approached the end of the exhibition hall, setting his eyes on the exosuit mentioned. Even though the exosuit had been crafted by Harrison, Kyle could already tell that it was a near masterpiece from his experience as an arcia etcher and his work on the prototype exosuit arm. Each engraving on the luxurious exosuit was exquisite and elegant in nature, as though it was an exosuit befitting of a noble, the edges decorated with ornamental drawings that made it even more exotic.</p><p>Most of the visitors stared at it in wonder and amazement, thinking that it was just another arctech knight armor. However, Kyle could see that the exosuit's spine was the key lynchpin of the entire exosuit's activation and mobility, far different from how a normal arctech knight armor suit would have operated. He decided to wait before striking, watching carefully for the rotation of guards while still listening to the conversation.</p><p>&quot;And you shall retreat your troops from the border of Versia?&quot; Harrison pushed, clasping his hands together while resting his elbows on the table.</p><p>&quot;Of course. As soon as you legally transfer everything south of the forest boundary to Raktor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That will have to take a while. We need a bit more time to consolidate our control on the nation.&quot; Harrison fiddled with a sliver fork, twirling it on the table. &quot;But we can indeed sign a contract now, witnessed by a representative from Proco.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed we can. Neither I nor the Duke ever wanted war, merely a token trophy to show that I still have teeth to screw those nobles in Tryas. I suspect we may have a fruitful business partnership going into the future.&quot; Count Leon grinned with a satisfied expression. &quot;While we await the witness to arrive, do please excuse me for a second, I have to use the washroom for a bit.&quot;</p><p>Contrary to the happy atmosphere in the VIP room where Harrison and Monero were sharing a toast while Count Leon was gone, Kyle's plans were in complete shambles, his mind struggling to come to terms with what Sasha had just relayed to him. [Are you absolutely sure?]</p><p>[Yes, sir. They are planning to sign a peace treaty. They are getting the Proco representative to come to the VIP room right now!]</p><p>Kyle's brain raced, calculating all the implications of the peace treaty, realizing that the consequences were dire, and everything hinged on this one moment. Without missing a beat, Kyle grabbed the holster of his Oriental Bloom, now modified with a basic arcia crystal embedded in it to enhance its power. [Sasha, blow up the prisoner wagon, and aim for Harrison, but do not kill him! Kill General Javel!]</p><p>With no hesitation, Sasha instantly swiveled the aim of the railgun to the prisoner wagon, pulling the trigger immediately. The projectile shot outwards with a boom, breaking the sound barrier with a rush of air trailing it. It slammed into the front arctech engine, before resulting in a brilliant ball of flame that immediately engulfed General Javel and the other Ilysian Punks in it, leaving them burning in arcia fire, turning them into husks.</p><p>Sasha then turned her attention to the VIP room, able to see Harrison's panicked face through the windows, prompting her to squeeze the trigger once more. The projectile smashed through the window, shattering the glass into a thousand shards while it rushed straight at Harrison. Before the projectile could reach him, a sudden dark blur had Nox accelerate in his heavy armor, his sleek metallic arm shield deflecting the projectile effortlessly and knocking it away, the projectile exploding harmlessly in the air and showering them in dust.</p><p>Nox locked eyes on Sasha in the far distance, quickly blurting into his radio. &quot;Someone just tried to assassinate Harrison. Secure all escape routes now - we're under attack!&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 114 - Grand Exhibition (2)</strong></p><p>[Sasha, inform the Ghosts that we have been compromised - attack every Nest guard in range!] Kyle urged as he shoved his way through the still stunned and confused crowd of exhibition viewers towards the exosuit, pushing them aside violently and drawing his handgun. The exosuit exhibit was at the very end of the warehouse, displayed prominently on a stage of sort elevated, the box supporting it painted entirely in white to give a sleek modern look.</p><p>The alarmed Nest guards were already on high alert, one of them already spotting Kyle bringing his Oriental Bloom handgun to bear on the nearest Nest guard. Kyle didn't hesitate to pull the trigger, firing a devastating shot that drilled a hole right between the eyes, gouging out the nose bridge and brain matter behind into a sickening splat as the guard's body collapsed like a ragdoll.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Nest Guard, +10 EXP</p><p></p><p>The shot resounded through the warehouse, civilians panicking and scrambling in all directions, trying to find an exit out while the Nest guards began to swarm Kyle, firing at him with no intention of taking him alive. Kyle grabbed the nearest fleeing civilian, using him as a shield against the incoming pellets as he weaved through the frantic crowd. Pellets ripped through the civilian's flesh, dying instantly from the withering barrage that had him bleeding from multiple wounds, frightening the nearby civilians away even more and causing a stampede.</p><p>Ignoring the screaming children and sounds of chaos, Kyle finally made it right up to the front of the exosuit display cabinet. In one swift motion, he ducked and rolled, firing shots that killed each Nest guard with precision, taking out a dozen of them easily before he smashed the cabinet with his own fist, the alarm sensors in the warehouse blaring.</p><p><em>Now is hardly the time for subtlety.</em> Kyle already knew that by killing General Javel, the jig was up. He needed to grab the exosuit and run. Reaching out with his hand, he searched for an opening on the exosuit, but instead had to duck and take cover behind the armor suit and the painted stage box itself, intending to use them to protect himself.</p><p>Unexpectedly, one of the pellets hit the exosuit from above, the pellet cutting through the armor like butter and nailing Kyle in the left shoulder, the force sending him sprawling onto the ground behind the white stage box in disbelief. He glanced up to see the gaping hole on the exosuit, the metal plates apparently a facade and made out of simple thin wood painted to look metallic. <em>What the-</em></p><p>He had no time to think, not when he was pinned down by countless guards that were beginning to filter in, some gaining a height advantage over him on the catwalks above, trying to get a lock on him. In the midst of the chaos, Sasha's voice suddenly came into Kyle's brain. [Sir, I have eyes on Count Leon. Do I kill him?]</p><p>[Negative. Shoot at every Versian - do not hurt anyone from Raktor or other countries. Focus on Harrison!] Kyle needed the assassination attempt to look as though it was a Raktor operation in order to instigate the war. If Sasha killed anyone from Raktor, it may provide plausible deniability to Count Leon and allow him to restart the peace process. He clutched his shoulder, using the Necklace of Healing to channel a soothing green glow onto his wound while he glanced nearby, noticing a few other industrial machinery and furnaces on display right next to the exhibit that he was hiding behind.</p><p>With the exosuit being a farce, Kyle had no reason left to stay, reloading the pellets into his handgun once more and checking his clothes. <em>Penchant for Violence!</em> He rolled out of the cover, expertly shooting back at the encroaching surrounding Nest guards, the pellets forcing them to take cover as well and causing the entire warehouse to devolve into an open firefight. Kyle ducked and weaved through the various exhibits, the pellets ringing off the brass of industrial machinery, plates, and pipes alike serving as intermittent temporary cover.</p><p>With each move, he took out a Nest guard at a time, dwindling their forces bit by bit till he managed to completely flank a Nest guard, using the pillars and crashes of exhibits as a distraction. Lunging with his free hand, he clasped onto the guard's neck, crushing it instantly and stealing the rifle the guard had. It wasn't exactly as efficient as the Aspis MK2 repeater, but it had a far better capacity for pellets than his handgun did.</p><p>Kyle began his counterattack, swerving and diving between the various exhibits, even utilizing a few horrified civilians as bait by forcing them to run out into the open, distracting the Nest guards while he plucked them off one by one. He didn't bother killing all of them, instead rushing for the exit back into the open street where true chaos was unfolding. Explosions rocked the once jovial festivities of the Grand Exhibition, the colorful stalls and tiles now stained with blood, sweat, and crying children trying to wake up their parents. Kyle sprinted down the street, locking onto the nearest escape route, when he heard Sasha fire yet another shot, the trail of the pellet visible to the naked eye as it streaked across the buildings.</p><p>[Sir, I can't hit Harrison. There's a man deflecting all pellets, and he seems to be reporting my location.] Sasha relayed.</p><p>[Understood. Retreat to the designated hiding spot, but stay above ground and wait for further orders.] Kyle sharply turned into an alleyway, slinking through the cluttered buildings and accessing a manhole that had him drop right down back into the 1st layer of the catacombs. Already, he could hear the sounds of fighting and battling echoing through the canals as Ghosts and Nest guards alike clashed in a growing battlefield, fighting for control over the uppermost level to retain access to Tenar. Kyle made a beeline straight for the main base in the third layer, entering the central chamber to see a clearly flustered Dekar.</p><p>As soon as Kyle entered the base, Dekar rushed up to him, grabbing him by the collar and whispering angrily. &quot;What the fuck did you just do?! Did you just put this entire movement in danger?!&quot;</p><p>Before Dekar got his answer, Kyle simply clasped his hands around Dekar's hands, easily peeling them off without any apparent effort, overpowering him entirely. &quot;We were compromised. Simple as that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Compromised?! We had a plan!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And that plan has been found wanting.&quot; Kyle didn't stand there idle, immediately heading towards the operations room where Lisa was belting out orders non-stop to the various Ghost squads, while other regular squad handlers gave intermittent updates on the course of the battle. &quot;How long can we hold?&quot; Kyle asked the clearly agitated Lisa who barely had a modicum of brainpower left to spare.</p><p>&quot;I don't know, but soon, more and more Nest guards are going to come charging in to find us. We really riled up the hornet's nest this time.&quot; Lisa shook her head as they watched other clerks continuously shift squad markers on the previously drawn-out map of the catacombs; Kyle was able to see the Ghost squads retreating in real-time as an infuriated Dekar entered the operation room as well, storming up to Kyle and dragging him aside.</p><p>&quot;If I didn't know any better, I'll say you were fucking planted by Harrison!&quot; Dekar spat through gritted teeth. &quot;We're going to lose everything we've built so far at this rate - it would take months, even years, to ever come back to this! Why did you fuck it up?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everything we've built?&quot; Kyle cocked an eyebrow. &quot;This is everything I BUILT!&quot; He raised his voice far louder than necessary, shocking the frustrated Dekar out of his anger. &quot;And we will not lose anything - in fact, we will gain more than ever thanks to my efforts today. This is just a temporary setback.&quot; He ignored Dekar, shoving him aside and returning back to the operations room central table, issuing orders.</p><p>&quot;Lisa, I want a slow retreat. Just like we planned. Have the Ghost squads spilt up into three, each of them going to one of the few cities. We will evacuate whatever supplies we can muster and head to Desham. Lisa, you take Ocra and liaise back with Culo. Dekar, you're going to Creuliz with Yona. Sasha, Feldon and I will head to Desham. How long will executing this plan take?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If we want to get most of the machinery and supplies out, then it'll take at least half a day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then Sasha, Feldon, and I will hold back the enemy for as long as we can. We will serve as the bait. Once your forces have reached the evacuation point, collapse all tunnels behind you with the prepared explosives. Do not let Nest track you in any way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about our informants up in the city? They are still embedded into the citizens!&quot; Dekar pointed out. &quot;Are we just going to abandon them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have no choice - if we are to survive, sacrifices have to be made. Do not tell them of our evacuation plan lest they leak it. This stays within us, understood?&quot;</p><p>Lisa nodded readily, already having learned from the start to trust in Kyle, while Dekar, on the other hand, was clearly suspicious about Kyle's plan but knew that they could not stand and fight against Nest. They only had two hundred fighters, which would be nearly impossible to hold out against the tens of thousands of Nest fighters and potentially military soldiers that would be deployed to crush them. It would be only a matter of time before their supply routes were cut off, resulting in potential starvation. They all knew they had to evacuate now or perish.</p><p>Naturally, Kyle did not tell them the full reason of why he initiated such an attack on Harrison. Before he prepared his defenses, he walked up to Feldon, whispering to him quietly out of earshot of everyone else. &quot;Feldon, send a message to one of the frontline Ghosts. Talk about how it was not our fault for the assassination. Make sure Nest is listening in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it, boss.&quot; Feldon saluted, moving to carry out his task while Kyle began to arrange all of his defenses. The heist of the Grand Exhibition was a complete bust, but only because of the imminent peace deal. <em>Harrison and Count Leon have been in cahoots this whole time. They've been using the threat of war on both sides as a way to control and pacify the population at large.</em> A small smirk grew on his phase as he loaded up an Aspis MK2 repeater. <em>Except now, the two of you will butt heads, and I will be the sole winner.</em></p><p>@@@@@</p><p>Aboveground, the banquet hall was in an utter mess, the explosion from the railgun's projectiles having peltered the hallway and blasted the VIP room into an unrecognizable pile of rubble. Amidst the crumbling tiles and broken furniture, Nox grunted as he lifted a massive chunk of debris, showing a fairly unhurt Harrison, whose ears were still ringing from the blasts. Other Nest guards had been knocked out fully while President Mornero was groaning on the floor, slightly injured and pinned under a fallen bookcase.</p><p>Nox hauled the debris aside, moving over to assist President Mornero and check his breathing. <em>Still alive.</em> He quickly activated his radio, tapping it rapidly in a known pattern. Immediately three Nest guards rushed into the room, their eyes widening at the scale of the damage.</p><p>&quot;Get these two men down to the bunker right now!&quot; Nox urged before another deafening explosion rocked the hall, causing screams to erupt from the foreign dignitaries who were now scrambling to safety under the care and protection of their bodyguards. More and more Nest guards came in, forming a defensive ring around Harrison and Mornero as they were escorted out towards a secret backdoor nested in the back of the banquet hall's stage, General Verian already waiting near it with a scowl on her face.</p><p>&quot;Look at this mess.&quot; She spat with derision. &quot;Your men are useless!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Save the blame game for later. We need to get to safety first.&quot; Nox ignored her taunt, placing his palm on the surface of the locked door. An arcia engraving unlocked a series of bolts within, revealing a sturdy metallic tunnel that led right to the basement of the Versian Parliament. None of the Nest guards were allowed in, Harrison staggering along the wall in a daze while General Verian carried Mornero. &quot;All of you - the sniper was located on the Gaudy Kino�s rooftop. White hair, red shirt. Find her and capture her alive - she's the one who tried to kill Harrison.&quot;</p><p>The Nest guards scrambled to catch Sasha while Nox slammed the tunnel entrance shut, reactivating the bolts. As he took another step back, he placed his hands once again into the wall, activating the internal lights and summoning a second metallic wall that completely blocked off the tunnel from the entrance, serving as a barricade if someone blew up the door again.</p><p>The tunnel led towards a secret bunker in the basement of the Versian Parliament, a location that only the ministers of Versia and other Versian leaders knew of. Harrison let out a groan as he slumped into a chair, trying to rid himself of the splitting headache from the shell shock, while Mornero was carefully fed a healing potion by General Verian, allowing him to regain consciousness gradually. &quot;Wh-who the fuck attacked us?&quot; Mornero flew into a rage the moment his eyes opened, though his body was hurting all over as he tried to shove General Verian aside.</p><p>&quot;We haven't figured that out just yet,&quot; Nox stated clearly. &quot;Our men are currently trying to apprehend the sniper responsible for the attack. Thankfully, you and Harrison are safe-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Safe?! SAFE?!&quot; Mornero burst out in fury, his fists tightly clenched as he struggled to sit upright. Whatever friendly and dignified visage he had worn for the masses melted away like a facade, revealing his true nature. &quot;We nearly died, and you call that safe?! I'm starting to question the necessity of even having you idiots around as security!&quot;</p><p>&quot;President Mornero, sir, I-&quot; Nox tried to defend himself, but Mornero wasn't having any of it, continuing his tirade.</p><p>&quot;First you nearly fumble the existence of the sweatshops, then you allow a major Nest leader to go missing. Weirdly enough, what follows after is a well-planned heist on Harrison's mansion, clearly informed by said major Nest leader who knew all of the nooks and crannies around his office!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We caught the perpetrators of Huriga and his men and retrieved everything of value. As for Yona, it is highly unlikely that she has been caught - the self-immolation engraving can not be disarmed easily. Even if she had leaked critical information, we have changed all of our protocols, including our codewords and messaging patterns. Anyone who obtained her information will not be able to access us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's the Ghosts of Versia. They are the ones who attacked us.&quot; Harrison suddenly spoke out with a clear sense of clarity. &quot;No one else has any motive to do so - only Minister Dekar and his ragtag team of rebels will. Tap into their communications network, and listen to all the radio chatter quickly!&quot;</p><p>Nox complied, pulling up an arctech radio installation embedded into the wall of the secret bunker, neatly tucked away in the corner. He tuned the channels, suddenly noticing a strange sound on one of them, and hurriedly turned the dial, locking onto the message.</p><p>[...don't know who attacked them. We're looking for the assassin - white hair, red shirt. No known alias nor registration found of the suspect. Whatever she did jeopardized our operation, and we had to wait until we could evacuate. Once we're ready to move, retreat to the third layer.] Feldon's voice carried over the waves, all four of them hearing it in the enclosed underground space of the bunker.</p><p>&quot;It's not them?&quot; General Verian scratched her chin. &quot;Or do they know we're listening in?&quot;</p><p>Harrison fell into a pondering state, a far cry from his jovial performance back in front of the public before. On the other hand, Mornero was still not done venting on Nox, still content to blast him fully with everything he had in the tank. &quot;And to think we don't know despite having a supposed full control of the catacombs. I was assured that Nest had a full understanding of the catacombs, but lo and behold a third layer! How is it that to this day, we still don't know where Minister Dekar is after Yona captured him?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sir, I guarantee that my best men are on the hunt. We will have their locations sniffed out by the day's end, third layer or not.&quot; Nox bowed apologetically, though his own fist was clenched, Nox preventing himself from retorting back to his employer.</p><p>&quot;Not good enough. If that intercepted communication is to be believed, we won't be fast enough.&quot; Harrison tapped his finger on the holster of his chair. &quot;Where is Count Leon? Was he attacked, too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Negative, sir.&quot; Nox shook his head. &quot;The only three shots were aimed at the prisoner wagon and you.&quot;</p><p>Harrison's expression darkened. &quot;Then there's another real possibility. Count Leon has betrayed us.&quot;</p><p>Mornero's eyes widened for a moment before he slammed his fist onto the chair. &quot;That scoundrel, I always knew his hunger would be insatiable. We should have never agreed to such an escalation of military power with him. The assassination was targeted at us so he could utilize the chaos to sweep all of Versia in one fell swoop!&quot;</p><p>General Verian nodded in agreement. &quot;Count Leon had always been vocal about restoring the pride of the Yual Dominion for the loss in the independence war. Even if it was the Ghosts of Versia who carried out the assassination, there's no doubt in my mind that the two are linked. Count Leon may be funding the rebels directly himself!&quot;</p><p>The bunker fell into contemplative silence as Harrison and Mornero came to grips with the changing tides. Just a few minutes ago, they were preparing to sign a peace treaty that would solidify their rule, yet now it had all come toppling down. &quot;This isn't good, not good for business...&quot; Harrison mumbled to himself. &quot;If the war really happens, Versia may be lost forever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll be damned if I let that Count Leon get the last laugh!&quot; Mornero punched the air with anger. &quot;I'll fight to my fucking last breath to keep Versia alive at all costs!&quot;</p><p>&quot;If Count Leon had been planning this attack all along, then he is surely aware of our military capabilities. He must be initiating a surprise attack as soon as he returns back to his military base.&quot; General Verian pointed out, clearly suspicious of anything Raktor. &quot;We cannot let him escape Tenar scott-free, this would be like letting ourselves be robbed!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nox, get your best men and chase down Count Leon, wherever he is. I don't care if he is in a convoy or not. Capture him alive and bring him here to us!&quot; Harrison ordered.</p><p>&quot;But sir, if we attack him, it may very well be a declaration of war! Perhaps we should investigate the situation further-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nox, who is your employer?&quot; Harrison interjected.</p><p>&quot;That would be you, sir.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And did I hire you for your strength or for your inane mind to question my ORDERS!&quot; Harrison roared. &quot;Count Leon could be laughing all the way to the bank, and while we sit on our asses and figure out who attacked us and who didn't, tens of thousands of Raktor troops would be gathering on the border, preparing for a first strike. And under no fucking circumstances will I let the name of Harrison Industries be tarnished like this, to be dragged through the mud being caught with our pants down. You will hunt Count Leon down like the Yual dog he is and bring him to ME!&quot;</p><p>Nox nodded, leaving the bunker with haste, while Harrison looked at General Verian. &quot;Order a general mobilization now. Mornero, it's time we declare a state of emergency. Utilize the assassination attempt to announce a curfew and lock down every damn entrance and exit in and out of Tenar. No one moves without our permission!&quot;</p><p>As soon as Nox cleared the tunnel, the first announcements of martial law were already sweeping the city, and arctech radio channels were hijacked to explain the situation. Nox ignored the waves of panic among the citizens, instead tapping his arctech radio again. &quot;Get me my top Tigers, now. Where is Count Leon?&quot;</p><p>[Sir, he's leaving the city in his wagon convoy.]</p><p>&quot;How many escorts?&quot;</p><p>[Fifty arctech knights, armed with repeaters.]</p><p>&quot;Get every nearby Nest squad to immediately attack them. Make sure they don't leave the city!&quot; Nox ordered hastily as he began to dash through the buildings, his armor's engraving glowing with energy as his speed was accelerated bit by bit, each stride getting easier than the other until he was basically stepping on air, swooping past the frantic crowds of cowering civilians.</p><p>With each stride, Nox had one of his Tigers joined him - an expert warrior trained in assassination and speed, able to keep up with Nox's enhanced speed, racing down through the streets towards Count Leon's convoy. By the time he had arrived there, ten Tigers were already with him, the group leaping up onto the rooftop and obtaining a bird's eye view of the fight breaking out near the city's main gate.</p><p>Just fifty meters before the city gate, Count Leon's convoy was still functional, inching forward as arctech knights aimed their Aspis MK1 repeaters towards the surrounding Nest guards and Versian military, the captain of Count Leon's knights shouting at the top of his lungs. &quot;Obstruction of the Count's path can be considered an act of war, martial law or not. You will provide passage for my master out of Tenar!&quot;</p><p>The city guards, who had now shut off the city gate, confusedly looked at each other, the standoff tense as neither side dared to fire a shot. Even the Nest guards who had answered Nox's call to gather here were unsure, knowing that any wrong mistake might trigger a cascade of events that had unforeseen consequences. Furthermore, it was clear that Count Leon's escorting knight contingent of fifty were far superior in both training and equipment.</p><p>That same hesitation that rested among everyone did not bother Nox. &quot;Kill everyone but Count Leon.&quot; He spoke calmly, prompting the ten Tigers to leap off the rooftop, diving straight towards the Raktor knights who had formed a defensive perimeter around the convoy.</p><p>As one of the Tigers dived in headfirst, two sharp blades emerged from his wrists, slamming straight into the weak flesh between the shoulder and the neck of his target Raktor Knight, blood instantly spurting out. The Raktor knight instinctively grabbed the Tiger's arm, crushing it with a devastating punch, though the Tiger nimbly leaped backward, using his uninjured hand to fire a pellet at one of the convoy drivers, killing him in one hit.</p><p>That single shot set off a bonfire of anger, each side instantly firing without abandon and clashing with swords, steel, and fists alike in a sea of combatants. Nest guards fired indiscriminately into the convoy, killing some of Count Leon's servants and knights, while the Tigers were slowly pressuring the knights to retreat further.</p><p>&quot;Protect the Count!&quot; The knight captain let out a rallying cry, the knights chanting in response before pushing forward with renewed vigor, some of the knights forcibly charging the city gate and trying to storm the tower. However, the city guards held firm, protecting the gate's mechanism and funnelling the attacking Raktor knights into a tight space and killing them easily.</p><p>Nox smiled with satisfication, knowing that Count Leon was not going anywhere as he descended gracefully from the rooftop himself, his armour bearing the brunt of his landing. As he recovered to a standing posture, a loud creaking sound suddenly came from the gate mechanism room, the city gate slowly inching upwards and revealing the distant horizon filled with trees.</p><p>&quot;PUSH! PUSH FORWARD!&quot; Emboldened by the opening gate, the knights fought even harder than ever, the Nest guards no match against their prowess and equipment alike. Even the Tigers were beginning to find it hard to stop or even kill the knights, the knights being the cream of the crop of Count Leon's retinue.</p><p>&quot;Get that city gate under control!&quot; Nox roared, himself making a beeline for Count Leon, only to come face to face with the knight captain himself, who immediately fired the Aspis MK1 repeater at Nox. Nox used his diamond-shaped arm shields to deflect the pellets, the armor he wore from head to toe hardly fazed by the incoming barrage. As soon as the pellets petered out, Nox charged ahead, clashing with the knight captain's sword head-on.</p><p>As they exchanged blows, punches, and kicks alike, it was apparent that Nox was not going to best the man in single combat. A dangerous glint in Nox's eyes through the slit of his armor flickered as he suddenly lunged with the tip of his diamond arm shield, stabbing into the waist of the knight captain before retreating quickly.</p><p>The knight captain raised his sword, prepared to swing at Nox, when he suddenly staggered back, the veins on his exposed skin starting to blacken with each pulse of his beating heart as he stumbled back and forth. Nox held a grin under his faceplate, using a single finger to shove the dazed knight captain aside and allowing access to the central wagon where Count Leon was held. Any other Raktor knight who tried to intervene was held back by Nest guards and Tigers, leaving Nox free to move.</p><p>Just as he reached his hand forward to wrench the door of the wagon open, alarm bells rang in his head as a familiar boom shot towards him, the same railgun almost tearing him apart. By the skin of his teeth, Nox retracted his arm on reflex, using the armshield to deflect the projectile haphazardly, sending it trailing off into a nearby building, crashing into an apartment.</p><p>Before anyone could react, the projectile exploded with impunity, digging an entire crater in the building and collapsing it halfway, the resulting debris and rubble that crashed onto the floor kicking up a cloud of dust that enveloped the entire convoy. Nox tried to recover his senses, but the same boom erupted once more, this time a second projectile slamming right into his chestplate. Instead of penetrating, Nox was sent skidding backward, his two feet digging into the cobblestone tiles and dragging them up.</p><p>Immediately, the second projectile exploded right in Nox's face, the resulting fragmentation killing anyone nearby and sending him toppling and tumbling down the street, his ears ringing and blood pounding from the sudden shock. He struggled to get back up onto his feet, but his arms didn't listen, vibrating shakily as he could only watch Count Leon's convoy begin to speed up towards the now fully open city gate. The Raktor knights leaped onto the nearest wagon, putting down suppressive fire. &quot;STOP THAT CONVOY!&quot; He bellowed with whatever strength he had.</p><p>A Nest guard hurriedly hauled a projectile launcher upwards, mounting it on his shoulder and preparing to fire at Count Leon's wagon. Before he could squeeze the trigger, the same railgun boom echoed, blasting the unfortunate guard into meat paste that was splattered all across the street, the launcher wrecked beyond repair.</p><p>Nox could only watch as Count Leon's convoy disappeared into the horizon rapidly, but his anger was now settled on the sniper who had attacked him more than five times. He looked up to see the white hair lady slinging the railgun behind her back, sprinting along the lengths of the walls towards the left, Nest guards firing wildly at her and missing entirely. &quot;GET THAT SNIPER NOW!&quot;</p><p>Back in the bunker, Harrison clenched his fist even tighter as he listened to the complete failure of Nox to capture Count Leon, almost about to tear his hair out in frustration. &quot;We were so close to success, to victory! We could have dominated the Yual Dominion's economy to the point where they would entirely rely on us! My business could have soared to greater heights, forming a new commercial empire that would have controlled the entire continent. That damn Minister Dekar is in cahoots with Count Leon, conspiring to bring us down!&quot;</p><p>Harrison slammed his chair, getting up and pacing the small bunker room, clearly agitated while Mornero began to call for an emergency cabinet meeting, the ministers all rushing down to the bunker and taking their seats in a conference room within an hour.</p><p>&quot;With the declaration of martial law and the attempt on our lives by Count Leon himself, war is almost inevitable. If we do not seek recompense for such an act of war, then Versia would no longer have its pride, and its sovereignty shall be trampled all over by subsequent transgression. It is here that we must put an end to it and fight to assert our right to live and be independent, free from the machinations of the Yual Dominion once and for all!&quot; Mornero explained with determination.</p><p>The weight of the situation was apparent to all of the cabinet ministers, many of whom had been put into power by Mornero himself when he ousted all of the former revolutionaries from the parliament. &quot;Starting from today, we shall move into a war footing. Lock down every movement in and out of the whole of Versia and have our conscription quotas raised. I want enough men drafted up to support a second wave of assault if necessary.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A second wave of assault...?&quot; The cabinet ministers looked at each other with confused glances before the finance minister finally spoke up. &quot;President, sir, wasn't the military policy to be a defensive one? Furthermore, calling up enough men to support a second army would have our economy crashing in one fell swoop. Riots and protests might begin almost immediately if we do so!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you not comprehend the reality of the situation that we're in?&quot; Mornero's voice lowered to a whisper. &quot;The fate of Versia is at stake! Within a week, Count Leon will have his men mobilized and attacking us with full force! There is no time for worrying about the economy or worrying about the poor sentiments of the citizens. This is SURVIVAL! Do you really think Count Leon is going to return to Raktor and not do anything after he just tried to kill us? To kill me?!&quot; He slammed the conference table in anger before jabbing his finger right at the finance minister. &quot;You will support the conscription, and you will cut every useless piece of socialist bullshit that that idiot Johan and Dekar have integrated into the system. I want every single tenar squeezed out of the population and put into the war effort. Do you understand?&quot;</p><p>The finance minister gulped instinctively when faced with the furious glare of &quot;Yes, President. I understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good. As for the fucking rebels, I will no longer tolerate these rats living in the basement of our capital city and jeopardizing our safety. General Verian, you shall be in charge of a full sweep. You have complete control of Nest, and I want that sniper and Minister Dekar in chains in front of me in two days. Use everything that we have in the arsenal to flush out each and every rat that opposes us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everything, sir?&quot; General Verian cocked her eyebrow. &quot;Some of our weapons are still experimental.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand. Use <em>everything.</em>&quot;</p><p>General Verian had a sly grin on her face, giving a military salute. &quot;With pleasure, President. They won't know what hit them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 115 - Grand Exhibition (3)</strong></p><p><em>Three hours later...</em></p><p>Smoke and fire reigned in the city of Tenar, more so in the deep underground of the catacombs. Dozens of Ghosts squads fought tooth and nail to hold the line, struggling against ever-increasing waves of Nest guards desperately. Some of the Ghosts wavered a little, unsure about the situation as they defended the various chokepoints in the intricate maze-like layout of the second layer.</p><p>&quot;We can't hold here much longer, Wez!&quot; One of the Ghosts shouted over the din of pellet fire and random explosions, each and every reverberation traveling far and wide through the canal. The sewage water coursing through was starting to be stained with blood, the fallen bodies of both Nest and Ghosts alike being swept away in the never-ending tide.</p><p>&quot;Not yet, five more minutes!&quot; Wez urged, himself leaning his entire weight against a temporary barricade fashioned from scrap metal and anything else that could withstand more than a few pellet shots. He clutched his rifle tightly close to his chest as he could see the sweeping of arctech lanterns from the Nest guards flickering and reflecting off the walls further, the beams trying to illuminate their barricade. Only his squad had been assigned to guard the intersection here.</p><p>&quot;WE DON'T HAVE FIVE MINUTES!&quot; The Ghost roared, jabbing with his finger furiously at another injured Ghost who was desperately trying to pour a healing potion on a large gaping wound, the edges of the flesh seared with burning embers from a recent explosion. &quot;That's our last health potion!&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you got time to worry about the potions, then you got time to worry about holding them back!&quot; Wez shouted back, poking out from behind his cover to fire a few shots from his Aspis MK2 repeater. The pellets slammed into an exposed Nest guard, ripping through his leather armor and causing him to stagger off the pathway, falling into the surging tide with a loud splash. Three glints of reflective glass were enough to warn Wez to quickly duck back into cover. Sure enough, a hailstorm of pellets filled the air, pockmarking Wez's cover. Another Ghost from Wez's squad popped out, taking advantage of the attention focused on Wez and taking potshots, earning another pained scream echoing down the canal over the rushing water.</p><p>The five minutes felt like an eternity, Wez only cognizant of the sweat sticking to his clothes, his knight armor's originally cool and chilling feeling long gone, replaced by a warm plate that clung to his body, half of it already chipped or dented from stray pellets that managed to nick Wez. Still, the knight armor provided a much higher level of protection than was afforded by the Nest guards. However, it was far from enough to stem the ever-increasing tide of enemies trying to push through the catacomb.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange rumbling sound began to send tremors through the canal, Wez's cover vibrating heavily as he peeked out from his hiding spot once more to try and spot the source. His eyes widened as he watched an entire platoon of Versian soldiers armed to the teeth with arctech knight armor and rifles rivaling theirs, charging down towards their defensive position to bolster the attack of the Nest guards. <em>Shit, the military is here too!</em></p><p>&quot;Quick, tell them that the army is moving in now!&quot; Wez urged the nearest Ghost to him, who hurriedly tuned the radio to the Ghosts’ channel, relaying the information.</p><p>&quot;There's no way we'll be able to hold out much longer! It's already been more than five minutes!&quot; The same complaining Ghost shouted. &quot;We need to retreat now!&quot;</p><p>Wez's heart palpitated as time slowed down from his perspective, his mind racing as he weighed his options. In a blink of an eye, he came to a decision, his expression determined. &quot;Take the injured and retreat right now to Base 4. I'll stay behind and collapse the intersection entirely.&quot; He began to rummage through his pockets, looking for explosives while glancing around for a weak spot. His gaze landed on a big red X mark, left behind by the scouts and supply crew, who had already labeled the easiest way to cave in the canal.</p><p>&quot;What?! Are you crazy? Then how will you retreat?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll figure that out. Go now, quick!&quot; Wez urged, grabbing his repeater and firing haphazardly over the cover. The random suppressive fire forced the incoming Versian soldiers to quickly duck out of the way, taking cover behind the various pillars along the length of the catacomb tunnels. He retracted the repeater, swapping out an empty canister for a new one from his backpack next to his side on the ground.</p><p>As he prepared to shoot again, he noticed that the rest of the squad was not moving, instead also fighting back. &quot;What the hell are you idiots doing?&quot; Wez shouted.</p><p>&quot;We ain't leaving without you!&quot; The other Ghosts wore grim faces, but their eyes burnt with fierce determination, ready to fight against the seemingly impossible odds to the end. With no time to chat, the squad rallied their morale together again, their spirits higher than ever as they let out a unified battlecry, firing as much ammunition as they could down the canal. Nearly a dozen soldiers were nicked by the sudden barrage, causing the rest of the Nest guards and Versian soldiers to retreat temporarily.</p><p>Suddenly, one of the Versian platoon leaders stepped out into the open, unafraid of the pellets at all. Wez focused all of his fire onto the men, but instead of the pellets injuring the platoon leader, point defense arcia bolts lanced out furiously, drawing green streaks across the canal. One of the green bolts shot right toward Wez, disintegrating the pellet along the way while vaporizing a gaping hole in Wez's cover, the resulting impact sending Wez tumbling backward.</p><p>The other Ghosts also tried to shoot back, but the point defense seemed to never end, a large fuel pack carried by two other Versian soldiers plugged into the platoon leader's armor. The connected tube churned rapidly and allowed the armor's engraving to be continuously lit, allowing a seemingly endless stream of green arcia bolts that streaked across the canal, the high energy incinerating and searing through anything.</p><p>Wez's vision faded in and out as he groaned, rolling on the floor. From his hazy sight, he could only watch as one of the Ghosts shot a pellet at the leader, earning an overwhelming point defense arcia bolt that singed his armor and sent the Ghost flying backward as well. Wez could feel someone grabbing his shoulder, trying to drag him away from the battle, but he could already hear the impending sounds of rushing metal Versian boots charging toward them. Even as his squadmates tried to retreat, Wez could already tell it was far too late for them, knowing that there was no hope of resistance anymore while he made his peace. <em>Better to die free than to die a slave.</em></p><p>Before Wez closed his eyes, he surprisingly saw a familiar figure appear in front of him, making him almost think it was a hallucination. <em>There's no way... there's no way that's the boss, right? He wouldn't come like this...</em> Yet there was something he could feel with each step the familiar figure took in front of him, something that couldn't be replicated easily. <em>It's him!</em></p><p>Without saying a word, Kyle grabbed Wez by the collar with one arm and tossed him unceremoniously down back towards the intersection to safety. &quot;Retreat now!&quot; Kyle waved his arm, his exosuit arm flaring into life as the engravings on it glowed with a brilliance unmatched. He charged towards the incoming Versian soldiers, a wide, confident grin plastered on his face.</p><p>None of the Versian soldiers could react in time when Kyle cleared the distance in just four short strides, his speed unfathomable as he stabbed forward with the Tattoo Knife headlong in his left hand, aimed right at the jugular of the platoon leader. With no time even for instinct to kick in, the jagged blade already skewered into the vocal cords of the leaders in a blink of an eye, Kyle swapping hands and reverse gripping the handle with his right and forcing it through. The strength of the exosuit arm whirred with power incarnate, the Tattoo Knife cleaving through the neck of the platoon leader like it was liquid.</p><p>Even before the soldiers fired a pellet at him, Kyle was already dancing through them, creating a chaotic battle as he used the soldiers themselves as a sponge to soak up the fired pellets. He was like a shadow, flitting through the platoon and inflicting terror among its ranks as he sliced limb from joint and head from the body, his motions swift and deadly. Each swing of the knife saw one more Versian soldier fall to the ground, the EXP System messages racking up in front of him, though he ignored them, mentally pushing them out of sight.</p><p>Within a minute, Kyle had already slaughtered close to twenty Versian soldiers and Nest guards alike, and he showed no sign of stopping, a veritable one-man army on his own in such an enclosed area. Each and every facet of the environment blended into his mind, able to calculate the most efficient path while every soldier was mentally imaged and predicted, his steps immaculate. Fear began to grip the hearts of the remaining soldiers, many of them fresh conscripts unwilling to fight against a seemingly impossible enemy, especially when their platoon leader was dead.</p><p>&quot;Retreat and regroup! Retreat and regroup!&quot; A frantic Versian recruit called out, his voice wavering in terror before Kyle locked onto him, using his free hand to fire a pellet from his Oriental Bloom handgun. The recruit's expression was locked in horror, a gaping hole searing through his left eye, the pellet bursting into a fleshy explosion that frightened anyone who saw it.</p><p>&quot;I ain't going to die here in this shitty tunnel!&quot; The survivors scattered like flies, running haphazardly down the canal in a disorderly retreat. Kyle shot a few more of them, racking his total kills to thirty, singlehandedly eradicating the attacking platoon. He sprinted back to the intersection, grabbing any dropped supplies the retreating Ghost squad had left behind and lugging them on his back.</p><p>Before he left the intersection, he took good aim with his handgun at the red X marked near the corner of the canal, the spot laden with explosives. With a single shot, he ignited the dormant combustible material, immediately destroying the support of the canals and collapsing it, blocking the entire pathway off, though the water current surged through the gaps in the rubble. [Sasha, report.]</p><p>[Sir, re-entering catacombs. There are too many enemies above.]</p><p>[Did Count Leon escape?]</p><p>[Yes, sir.]</p><p>[Good work. Meet at Base 1. Do not move too fast - make sure Nest knows your track. We're going to lure them to us so the other three bases can evacuate.] Kyle retreated back to the main base, which had already been slowly hollowed out. He had only thirty Ghosts left in the base, the rest being supply and logistic workers who had already retreated into the Rotten Chamber as their backup base. Dekar and Yona had already moved to another base, which was much closer to the Crueliz escape route. All Kyle had to do was stall Nest and the military for as long as he could to preserve as much manpower and supplies before retreating towards Desham.</p><p>&quot;Sir, the route has already been set. We'll recuperate in the Rotten Chamber and then set off. We have already sent forward scouts to check the tunnels towards Desham once more, and they will liaise with our other cell planted there.&quot; Feldon gave his report with a salute. Each of the cities in Versia was already prepared by Sasha and Culo before Kyle had even arrived in Ocra, with each region having a designated cell leader, just like how Lisa had been appointed as leader for Tenar.</p><p>&quot;Good. How are our defenses?&quot; Kyle asked.</p><p>&quot;We have set up enough roadblocks towards the fourth layer entrance room, and we've planted enough explosives to collapse the whole hideout if necessary.&quot; Feldon pointed out the barricades made from mattresses, makeshift crates filled to the brim with dirt dug from the dungeon, and leftover bedframes stacked haphazardly to funnel any attackers coming in. Each Ghost was armed with an Aspis MK2 repeater, having harvested enough poor arcia crystal to at least last a battle, Feldon himself armed with one as he led Kyle around the defensive setup. &quot;I don't think that Nest is coming here anytime soon, though - with you collapsing that intersection and the other Ghost squads splitting up, it would take maybe a day for them to find us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nest is coming. I'm bringing them here. All of you, prepare yourself. Make sure you're stocked up on ammunition, supplies, and potions. Anyone who is injured immediately retreats back into the fourth layer, understood?&quot; Kyle raised his voice louder for the various Ghosts to hear. &quot;We will not fall here - we will survive! And we will fight hard enough for our comrade to survive!&quot;</p><p>&quot;YES, SIR!&quot; The Ghosts roared back in unison, preparing themselves for the imminent battle. Kyle had now practically ascended into a heroic figure for them, and the word of him selflessly saving Dekar's commandos and rescuing Wez's squad from certain doom had spread like wildfire. None of them had even the slightest doubt that Kyle would sacrifice them. With their morale at an all-time high, they even began to joke with each other, laughing about how Nest would fall into their trap. &quot;Anyone who even steps into the central chamber is going to be annihilated!&quot;</p><p>Surprisingly, Kyle, too, had the same mindset, though for a far different reason. <em>Training these Ghosts was difficult and a sink on resources. Every action I take to protect them will increase the solidarity of the group, and in return, my activities will be less scrutinized.</em> Kyle never lost sight of the objective: to steal everything that belonged to Harrison and make it his. The imminent war and the rebel movements were just simple cover-ups to his true motive, and any action that would work toward that goal without compromising himself, he would do, even if it meant acting as a selfless, righteous hero. Furthermore, once Versia was rid of Harrison, Kyle would then be able to naturally assume the same economic role, this time with ardent Versian supporters on his side. <em>All part of the plan.</em></p><p>While he was truly irked at the farce of an exosuit, he wondered whether or not Harrison really had an exosuit to display. <em>Perhaps the reason why it was a fake was because he actually did not have anything to show.</em> Kyle knew he wouldn't know until he captured Harrison himself, but he suppressed his anger at being tricked deep into his heart, not letting it cloud his current decision. He focused on arming himself with the necessary gear, unveiling a second railgun much like Sasha's. Unfortunately for Kyle, most of the specialized projectiles had been handed to Sasha for the operation, leaving him only two explosive rounds to use. They were difficult to make, and Kyle was required to handcraft them himself.</p><p>Soon, within ten minutes, Sasha had entered the base, panting and huffing, her arms and legs clearly wounded with some pellets lodged inside her muscles and bones. Despite her prowess, it was near impossible to evade a hailstorm of pellets aimed at her by entire squads and platoons chasing her through the city. She collapsed onto the ground near the entrance, Kyle and Feldon immediately rushing up to carry her out. &quot;Feldon, get two Ghosts to move her to the Rotten Chamber and get her healed immediately.&quot;</p><p>[Sir, I-I can still fight!] Sasha grunted telepathically as she struggled to move, but her limbs were already immobilized by the pellets still embedded inside. Kyle grabbed her arm firmly, making sure she couldn't get up.</p><p>&quot;You've done well enough. Go rest. This isn't the final fight, and it's far from the heights you wanted to see. Don't sacrifice yourself needlessly.&quot; Kyle nodded, with the two Ghosts immediately treating her wounds with healing potions before moving her down to the fourth layer.</p><p>&quot;Shit, if Sasha is here, it means Nest is not far behind!&quot; Feldon exclaimed, adjusting his Aspis MK1 armored helmet and fastening the straps. The jokes and small talk had died down, with a solemn, grim atmosphere now taking hold of the remaining Ghosts. They only numbered thirty in total, including Feldon and Kyle, but they all knew that they may be facing a force ten times their size.</p><p>&quot;No sweat, no sweat at all.&quot; Feldon continued mumbling to himself as he took up position behind a barricade facing the main entrance tunnel. They had barricaded every other entrance to the base, leaving only the tunnel from which Sasha had arrived through as the sole funnel point from which Nest could potentially attack. &quot;All I got to do is just pull the trigger the moment I see any human figure pop up from that entrance. Easy. Just fire as many pellets as you can, nothing can wrong, Feldon, nothing can wrong.&quot;</p><p>Kyle had to listen to Feldon's inane mumbling and was about to berate him when a sudden eerie tremor started to rock the entire central chamber, the vibrations intensifying over time as it approached. The barricades rattled violently, the Ghosts swiveling their head around in confusion to try and find the source of the tremors. Kyle himself did not truly understand what was happening. <em>Is this an earthquake? Or-</em></p><p>Before he could react, a sudden burst of dirt and rubble erupted from the top of the ceiling of the central chamber, the rocks tumbling onto the ground and crushing two Ghosts that were unfortunate enough to be right below, dying instantly. Within seconds, five ropes were thrown down from the hole, Nest guards rappelling down quickly and entering the very center of the base, right behind the barricades that had been set up.</p><p>Kyle moved quickly, his handgun shooting down the Nest guards as they came in, but there was a clear limit to how fast he could shoot. More than three dozen Nest guards fell in, immediately attacking the nearest Ghosts that were all universally caught off-guard.</p><p>Some of the Ghosts further away swiveled their rifles to aim at the rappelling Nest guards, but another deafening explosion rocked the chamber, the main entrance tunnel bursting apart wider with the rubble being flung out by the shockwave. The enlarged entrance suddenly saw another three dozen Versian soldiers enter, the entire central chamber devolving into a mad firefight.</p><p>&quot;Shit, shit, shit!&quot; Feldon cursed as he fired as quickly as he could, holding down the trigger and running the poor arcia crystal mounted on the repeater dry, killing three Versian soldiers in one fell swoop. Elsewhere, Kyle immediately grabbed the five ropes and bunched them up into both hands.</p><p>With his exosuit arm helping out, he yanked the rope as hard as he could, causing the rappelling Nest guards to get swung violently on the ropes. Those further up on the rope had their faces smacked against the hole, knocking them out. Kyle tugged the rope again as hard as he could, finally causing the five ropes to snap, sending a few Nest guards plummeting downwards to their deaths.</p><p>Before Kyle could recover, a sudden black shadow jabbed towards him, the sharp pointy tip of a diamond-shaped arm shield nearly cutting into his arm. He deftly dodged, spinning around with a devastating roundhouse kick, only to miss the kick as the shadow ducked low, the shadow's shin slamming into Kyle's one, attempting to sweep Kyle off his feet.</p><p>Unfortunately, the kick had no effect, Kyle still standing strong as he grappled with the shadow, finally recognizing the sleek black metallic armor. <em>It's Nox!</em> Taking two steps back, nearby Ghosts began to fire at Nox, showering in a violent barrage.</p><p>Nox's arm shields blocked his face while the rest of his body armor's engraving began to light up, seemingly soaking the pellet damage to no effect. The pellets that hit his armor all collapsed onto the floor like a waterfall, scattering like marbles. Nox grinned as he lowered his arm shields, only for his eyes to widen as Kyle aimed a second railgun at him, the explosive projectile already zooming towards him.</p><p>Nox did not avoid the hit; instead, he shielded himself once again and blocked the projectile with his armshields. The projectile burst into a brilliant ball of flame, but it was soon dissipated into streaks of smoke, Nox's armor seemingly left untouched save for the engravings flickering on his armor, their brilliance unsteady as the energy concentrated onto his arm shields.</p><p>He rushed forward with a blinding speed, his movement hard even for Kyle's keen eyes to catch as he tried to jab at Kyle once more with the tip of the armshield.</p><p>Kyle was forced to use the railgun's shaft to block the hit, the sparkles along the edge of the barrel dazzling from the friction, but unlike the first attack by Nox, he suddenly found himself lifted off the ground and thrown backward by an extreme force, the arm shield engraving's arcia energy expelling rapidly. Kyle's vision swirled as he flipped in midair, landing back onto the ground with his two feet slamming hard into the rock, carving two lines as Kyle's body was still moving backward, the force of the hit inconceivable.</p><p>He watched as Nox deflected yet another pellet stream, the energy from the pellets seemingly absorbed harmlessly by the armor and channeled towards the arm shields. <em>He's converting the kinetic energy absorbed for his own use!</em> Kyle quickly raised his railgun in response to a third strike by Nox, using the sturdy railgun as a short staff to parry the incoming hits.</p><p>Kyle landed a few counter hits in, but it clearly did no perceivable damage to the armour. Instead, Kyle found himself on the back foot, having to block stronger and stronger hits as Nox reused every attack he received, each jab and strike by the arm shield getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>A momentary lapse in calculation saw Kyle dodge a jab by the skin of his teeth, the tip of the arm shield stabbing past his ear. Unexpectedly, before Kyle could move to the side, a hidden jagged edge emerged from around the shield, one of the edges slicing Kyle's earlobe.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Status Effect</strong>: Debilitating Poison</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>What?!</em> Kyle had never received a debuff before, but he had no time to think, with Nox capitalizing on the shock to push his advantage, delivering a kick to Kyle’s left knee to cripple him.</p><p>However, Kyle’s legs barely buckled, allowing Kyle to quickly backpedal and make some distance while the wound on his cheek and earlobe began to bubble with a greenish liquid, seeping into Kyle’s bloodstream.</p><p><em>Necklace of Healing!</em> The green aura surged around the wound and enveloped the green poison, but there was no notification of debuff removal. Already Kyle could feel his body being slightly more sluggish, slower to react. The sounds of battle and rage were already noticeably far degraded compared to his usual sense and spatial awareness. He dodged and weaved through the next three Nox attacks, using the antidote vial between exchanges and splashing it onto his earlobe.</p><p>&quot;That won't be enough to cure the poison - you're going to need at least ten of that.&quot; Nox grinned under his faceplate, knowing he had Kyle cornered. &quot;You're not going anywhere!&quot;</p><p>Nox’s fighting style was unique, using the sharp edges of the arm shield and the hidden blade to slice and dice as he continued to throw punch after punch at Kyle, no longer trying to kick Kyle’s legs in close-quarter combat. His speed was unmatched, able to throw two attacks for every one attack Kyle tried to retaliate with.</p><p>Just as Kyle swung the railgun at Nox’s head, Nox ducked and crouched to the floor before launching his foot up towards Kyle’s chest. Kyle quickly pulled back his railgun to block the hit, but another retractable blade was hidden in Nox’s shoe, firing outwards and lodging itself into Kyle’s right shoulder between the gaps of the armor.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Status Effect</strong>: Debilitating Poison</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle’s mind began to falter, his thought process beginning to diminish as his combat stats began to plummet. But Kyle immediately grabbed Nox’s leg before performing a body throw and slamming Nox into the ground. The impact was absorbed right into Nox’s armor, dissipating as Nox immediately twisted his body to deliver yet another kick with his free leg, forcing Kyle to let go of Nox and dodge in anticipation of yet another hidden blade. Sure enough, the hidden blade was fired, nearly missing Kyle’s nose as he avoided it in time.</p><p>&quot;Enough.&quot; Kyle suddenly spoke with a clear tone, the air around him changing rapidly. <em>Penchant for Violence!</em> His body suddenly surged with strength, overwhelming the Debilitating Poison and allowing him to temporarily overpower Nox. The sudden change in power caught Nox off-guard, with Kyle able to lunge forward and pin him down to the ground with a frontal slam, preventing Nox from using his speed to dodge any more hits.</p><p>&quot;Seems like you never learn anything!&quot; Nox activated another hidden blade on his armour, this one jabbing deep into Kyle's flesh.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Status Effect</strong>: Debilitating Poison</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>&quot;You're going to need more than that to stop me.&quot; Kyle lunged forward with his right exosuit arm, grabbing Nox's armored helmet and ripping it off, the helmet sailing back towards the interior hallway of the hideout, revealing Nox's face and his red hair. Without hesitating, Kyle nocked back his right arm, sending all of his strength into a single punch that crushed Nox's nose and frontal teeth in one hit, his jaw bending inwards.</p><p>However, before Kyle could deliver yet another heavy-handed blow, the armor of Nox suddenly began to glow hot red, scalding Kyle’s skin and forcing Kyle to get off. Nox quickly recovered, but his eyes were bloodshot as, his nose was completely caved in, with half of his teeth missing, and blood flowing freely from his mouth.</p><p>Nox panted visibly, with the engraving on the armor beginning to die down. <em>That must have taken a lot of arcia energy out of him.</em> Kyle prepared to counterattack, but instead of Nox facing Kyle head-on, Nox began to retreat behind the other Nest guards, who were still locked in a tense firefight with the other Ghosts. Casualties were beginning to mount on both sides, more so for the side of Nest than the Ghosts due to the difference in equipment.</p><p>Kyle tried to chase, knowing that if he captured Nox, it would prove to be a valuable asset like Yona. Unfortunately, Nox had disappeared as fast as he had entered the battlefield. Kyle turned his attention to the still-increasing tide of Nest and Versian soldiers storming the base. &quot;Fall back to the second layer!&quot;</p><p>The Ghosts retreated into the hallway, using the tight and narrow corridors to funnel the attacking enemies. The Versian soldiers were not dumb however, using deployed explosives to blow holes through the walls and allow them to flank the roadblocks. Kyle fought hard in the rooms, preventing the Versians from backstabbing the Ghosts, while Feldon let out a battle roar, laying down a sustained pellet fire that mowed down anyone stupid enough to expose themselves in the hallway.</p><p>The bodies of Nest guards and Versian soldiers began to pile up significantly, so much so that the Ghosts were beginning to use them as the barricade itself. Blood, meat, and organs flowed freely in rivers that snaked their way through the hallway, imprints of military boots and spent pellets scattered around. Kyle himself was covered from head to toe with stains of blood, the effect of the Penchant of Violence having worn out long ago.</p><p>Yet, despite the clearly insurmountable odds, they were able to continuously hold out for what seemed to be an hour, with Kyle doing the bulk of the killing. Already, two hundred soldiers had fallen at his hands alone, the EXP stacking up tremendously.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Your level has increased from level 28 to level 29!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">All stats increased.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Bonus free points granted.</p><p>The waves of Versian and Nest soldiers never seemed to stop coming, like lambs to the slaughter. Despite the ease of the defense, Kyle felt that something was inherently wrong. <em>Harrison wouldn't do something so stupid as throw this much fodder into a grinder. There must be something bigger at play here...</em></p><p>In the central chamber, a black fog-like cloud began to descend from the hole in the ceiling. It floated downwards gently, an unknown device from above pumping out fumes that continuously sank below. As it hit the ground, it surged out in all directions, slowly filling up the chamber and crawling toward the hallways.</p><p>&quot;Gas masks, now!&quot; Kyle urged, the Ghosts quickly donning the masks, having been well-trained. Unfortunately, Kyle watched as the black gas surged past the Versian and Nest soldiers alike, the gas lapping up at them.</p><p>&quot;Huh..? What is this fo- URK!&quot; None of them could react fast enough, assuming it was smoke from a normal fire. However, as they inhaled the smoke, their eyes began to water uncontrollably, while their skin began to wrinkle up, the folds on their cheeks scrounging up so hard until it began to bleed profusely. Their throats began to sear with pain as they stared at their shriveling hands in horror, as though all the water and life were being sucked out of them.</p><p><em>This is My Turf!</em> Kyle immediately stepped into the hallway, using the invisible barrier to block as much of the smoke as possible, but it was useless - the smoke, too, began to seep into the adjoining rooms bit by bit, circumventing his barrier as the Ghosts stepped back warily, unsure of what to do next. &quot;FELDON, GET EVERYONE OUT NOW!&quot; Kyle roared.</p><p>It was a race against time, Feldon hurriedly leading the retreat back to the fourth layer entrance. There was no time for decorum; each Ghost immediately sprinted down the cramped tunnel regardless of how many scrapes and bruises they earned from the jagged walls. Kyle carefully stepped back, keeping track of his Turf barrier before reaching the end of the hallway. He noticed Nox's helmet on the ground, quickly picking it up.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Arcia Exosuit Helmet Prototype(Advanced)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle didn't have time to cheer about the prize, moving as fast as he could back to the entrance of the fourth-layer tunnel. The black smoke seemed to suck the humidity out of anything that it touched - rations, walls, and wood all began to shrivel up rapidly, the water content completely lost. Placing his hand on a nearby wall engraving, he sent a surge of arcia energy, zig-zagging down a pre-engraved line that led right to the central chamber, illuminating the bodies of the fallen from below.</p><p>Within a split second, a thunderous blast erupted from the central chamber, each of the rooms in sequence being blown up by arranged explosives. Screams and shrieks of horror erupted from the hole above the ceiling as the black fog was pushed upwards, no doubt enveloping whoever deployed the gas. Kyle, too, sprinted down the tunnel, but not before collapsing the tunnel behind him, creating a pile of rubble that stemmed from the flow of the dangerous black fog. However, the resulting explosion instead pushed the black fog out harder, the velocity increasing through the gaps and seams of the debris.</p><p>As soon as he reached the large corridor that led to the Rotten Chamber, he ordered the Ghosts to run away as fast as possible before he took aim with his railgun at the tunnel, blowing it up with his last projectile. The explosion blasted apart the rubble and collapsed the tunnel even further, the heat melting some of the stone into slag that sealed up most of the gap. Kyle could still see some black fog leaking, its effect already apparently on the rapidly shriveling bioluminescent algae. &quot;Retreat to the Rotten Chamber, we've done all we could. Tell Lisa, Dekar, and Yona to evacuate immediately before the gas hits them as well!&quot;</p><p>Far above the chaos in the catacombs, in the Versian Parliament Presidential Office, Mornero clenched his fist in anger once more, the plan to capture the rebels clearly failing. &quot;It's clear that the rebels know more about our capabilities than we do - we can't even round up the rats in our own backyard! If the information they have gets out to Count Leon, then we'll be at a clear disadvantage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then the solution is simple.&quot; Harrison calmly spoke, his anger from before already calmed as though he had accepted the change in events. &quot;Have the general mobilization concentrate at Ocra. We strike first.&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 116 - Premonition</strong></p><p>The retreating Ghosts staggered down the corridor, the stronger among them supporting other weaker ones, limping slowly away from the black fog that was already subsiding. Kyle, too, was no exception, the intense battle having sucked most of the arcia energy out of him. While he had activated Penchant for Violence regularly, there was still no surefire method to recharge arcia energy directly into his body, even when consuming stamina potions.</p><p>Feldon huffed and panted as he supported himself against the wall, taking each step slowly while drinking a stamina potion. Despite the abundance of stamina potions, mental fatigue was not something that could be solved by simply chugging dark-yellow liquid, especially not when everyone around save for Kyle looked equally miserable. &quot;We look like we just lost a fight at the playground...&quot; Feldon remarked, his eyes glazing as he spotted the end of the corridor. The Rotten Chamber environment came into view, and two Ghosts that had been sent ahead with Sasha were waiting for them.</p><p>&quot;Is the temporary area secured?&quot; Feldon asked as he approached, massaging his aching arm and trying to stretch his shoulders.</p><p>&quot;Yes, sir. The others have already set up a resting point with what supplies we could evacuate.&quot; The two Ghosts led them to another area of the Rotten Chamber, one that already had most of the trash removed and held at bay by rock walls, creating an encampment that stood out from the rest of the environment. Despite the persistent stench from the nearby trash that had been scooped up and cleared, it was enough to serve as a temporary area to recuperate and reorganize the men. Within the encampment were makeshift tents and crates of potions and rations, about thirty logistic workers and ten Ghosts in total having built up the camp. Adding the surviving sixteen Ghosts from the last ditch defense, Kyle now had a command of 26 Ghosts to utilize.</p><p>&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Feldon's voice was filled with exhaustion as he sat on the cleared ground, the same dark green block that walled the corridor making up the dungeon floor, its full extent buried under mountains of trash outside the encampment.</p><p>&quot;We wait.&quot; Kyle replied, his voice a bit shaky as he kept up a strong facade, acting like there was nothing wrong with him as he walked up to a crate of antidote vials, checking how many they had left. <em>A hundred...</em> Kyle grabbed ten, immediately downing them like a madmen while Feldon stared in horror, though Feldon did not dare to ask what was happening.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: </p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Debilitating Poison Stack Reduced</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Looks like its working, but clearly the general antidote is not that effective.</em> Kyle filled a sack with fifty antidotes, drinking them slowly bit by bit and trying to purge the poison as well. He needed to be at his best for what was to come, especially when being hunted by the military throughout the country.</p><p>The state of the encampment was sad to see, especially for the Ghosts and workers who clearly remember how well organized the main bases had been. The haphazard placement of crates, tables, chairs and beds made many feel like they have gone back to their days as a refugee or a slave, triggering deep repressed memories. It was also apparent to everyone that they had been forced to retreat, effectively a defeat by Nest.</p><p>However, Kyle did not see the result as a defeat or a loss for him. Instead, it was a huge win. He still held in his hands Nox's helmet, which turned out to be an exosuit prototype. <em>One more piece to the puzzle.</em> Kyle gathered that with both the arm and the helmet prototype, he might be able to gleam enough information to begin construction of the legs as well. As for the spine, the Ancient Exosuit Spine would do well as a reference on how to move forward with his first full-body exosuit prototype. It was clear that the enemies were well advanced in their technological mastery of Galactic Era ruins and relics, so Kyle saw no further need to hold back as much. <em>Though I'll keep the gamma lasers hidden for a later date.</em></p><p>While he did not manage to steal a functioning exosuit from Harrison's Grand Exhibition, his work at preventing the peace treaty from being signed was a necessary action for the continuation of his plan. <em>Without the war, there would be almost no chance to undermine Harrison. It is in the chaos that I shall thrive more than ever.</em> Already, the information and technology he had obtained from this entire Versian expedition far exceeded his expectations, having only expected to find maybe one or two Galactic Era personal shields.</p><p>&quot;What are we waiting for? We should be trying to leave as soon as possible.&quot; Feldon grumbled, clearly unhappy with Kyle's order. &quot;Nest would eventually dig up the collapsed hideout and find out about the entrance!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That may be so, but it would take more than a day or two to do so. We can rest here in the meantime.&quot; Kyle let out an exasperated sigh, before his sight landed once again on the Arcia Exosuit Helmet Prototype. <em>I never really thought about it, but how would an INT stat increase affect others?</em> He was quite confident Feldon did not have a System from his observations. If Feldon did have one, then it might have been the greatest waste of a System ever. &quot;Why don't you think over the plan with this on?&quot; He tossed the helmet over to Feldon, who almost fumbled it before clutching it tight, examining it curiously.</p><p>&quot;Strange, I didn't know you managed to get the helmet off that weird person. I'm not sure if the helmet actually fits my hea-woah. Woah. W-O-A-H.&quot; Feldon's pupils dilated, his eyes widening, and he stared around at the encampment with a brilliance about him that Kyle could never imagine Feldon having. It was as if he was a newborn child seeing the world in a whole new light. &quot;I get it now. I get everything! The universe, the meaning of life, the-&quot;</p><p>Kyle smacked Feldon in the helmet, knocking him out of his stupor. &quot;I didn't give you the helmet to be philosophical. So, what do you think of the plan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quite elementary, my dear Ky- I mean, boss. We recuperate and gear up for two days before moving over to Desham. Once we arrive, we will begin to take control of the city where possible, most likely through the refugee camps. With enough support, we may be able to raise a riot to overtake whoever is in charge. We will then need to establish the same manufacturing and training regimens that we had already implemented in Raktor and the catacombs, but on a far larger scale. Harrison will be too occupied with the war to even try and crush us. And if he does try to crush us, the contingent that he sends cannot be too large as he still needs to fight against Count Leon. The longer the war goes on, the better our odds of capturing his businesses and factories over Versia one by one. If either side starts to lose, then we should step in to - oh my god.&quot; Feldon gasped with realization.</p><p>Kyle was impressed, not so much at Feldon but at the effects of the helmet. <em>Interesting. So, other humans also feel the effects of an INT increase.</em> It was rare to find such a piece of equipment, and most of his sources of INT came from titles, something he was sure Feldon did not have. <em>Perhaps there could be something done with this in the future...</em></p><p>&quot;You! You only called me here because I was downright useless in the Culdao Peaks!&quot; Feldon exclaimed in horror, though his nose began to bleed a little, a trickle of blood drooping. &quot;Is that what you think of me? Well, I'm a different man now, smarter than ever. And I'll show you that I am far more valuable than any-&quot;</p><p>Kyle snatched the helmet off Feldon's head, the brilliance on Feldon's face disappearing like a switch went off, as though his brain had suddenly smoothened out. &quot;Huh...? What just happened?&quot; Feldon grunted before clutching his head in agony, his nosebleed getting stronger. &quot;Owwwww my brain! What is happening?!&quot;</p><p><em>Looks like even with the INT increase, the body can't handle it. That's not good.</em> Kyle would have liked to experiment more, but definitely not on Feldon. He and Sasha were his two most competent officers now, with Lisa, Dekar, and Yona having gone to the other cities. <em>I'll test it next time.</em></p><p>Feldon lay on the floor, nursing a splitting headache, while Kyle continued to drink antidote after antidote. It took about an hour before the status effect was finally dispelled fully, Kyle being restored to his former strength. <em>Much better now.</em> He rose to his feet, moving around the encampment to check on the status of the other Ghosts.</p><p>&quot;How were we pushed back so easily? We had so many plans, so many contingencies. I... I just never expected to have to fall back to the worst case scenario.&quot; One of the Ghosts muttered as he triple-checked his repeater, cleaning out the barrel and removing any residual from the pellets' friction.</p><p>&quot;At least we didn't all perish for nothing. We can still fight in another city.&quot; Another replied, taking care of a heavily injured Ghost who was recuperating on a loosely arranged bunch of fabrics and clothes, serving as a temporary bed.</p><p>&quot;We were this close to ending all of this...&quot; The first Ghost sighed in defeat. &quot;We were inches away from killing Harrison and Mornero!&quot;</p><p>The other Ghosts around did not reply, having no arguments against that. Kyle saw the same sentiment being echoed around the other workers as well, it is clear that a defeat was a defeat to them, regardless of how Kyle saw it personally. They had a different goal to him, and as such, it was natural for a group of this size to have second doubts. Still, it was a problem that needed to be solved, and Kyle wasn't willing to let such a notion fester too long in the hearts of his men, men he needed.</p><p>&quot;Gather in the medical tents,&quot; Kyle ordered, all able-bodied Ghosts and workers gathering around for what seemed to be a debriefing. Their faces were still grimy, covered in sweat and blood from the recent battles, while the workers themselves were exhausted from the sudden evacuation, having not much time to prepare. An air of failure reigned among them, yet to their surprise, Kyle looked more confident than ever.</p><p>&quot;My comrades. We have fought long and hard over the past months. Some of you have been with the Ghosts for three months, others a day. But today, we still managed to clinch an important victory!&quot;</p><p>&quot;A victory...?&quot; The Ghosts were all stupefied, exchanging confused glances before one of the more outspoken of them shouted to Kyle. &quot;How is it a victory when we're in such a state?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We may have 'lost' the battle, but the war for Versia is in our favor.&quot; Kyle grabbed a nearby metal stick used for cleaning the repeaters, using the sharp end to draw on the ground, etching through the dirt. &quot;Before today, not many knew of our movement. Only those who had been rescued or truly discriminated against had found their way to us. In some aspects, many of you are here solely because of luck.&quot;</p><p>Kyle continued tracing, drawing out a rough map of Versia. &quot;Imagine if you quit right now. That at this very moment, this critical juncture in the fate of the nation, you decide that its an impossible fight, and you give up? Think of how the future would be - recall where you came from, what the military have done to you, what Harrison and his men have inflicted onto you. Do you want to go back? Do you want to suffer once more? Do you want your children, your family and your friends to be equally oppressed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We should run! Run away to Proco, to Hwayul, anywhere!&quot; The same outspoken Ghost retorted. &quot;We can carve out and survive in the wild, away from all of this. We have the weapons and tools to do it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what would you tell your children? What would you tell your grandchildren? That when monsters ruled, you shied away and accepted your fate, running away from between your legs?&quot; Kyle argued back. &quot;It is in times like this that make or break a fighter. Are you willing to be broken, after everything you've been put through?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But who would join us now? How do we recover what we lost? We're scattered beyond Tenar now, and it would take a miracle to get back to where we were. It's impossible!&quot;</p><p>Kyle held a small growing smile on his face &quot;Do you not understand? This is the miracle! It's a miracle that so many were willing to stand up to Harrison, and that with the result of this battle, even more dissatisfied Versians will rally to our banner, join our cause and fight for a free Versia! Who else has stood up to the Versian military and can say 'I survived' ? Suddenly, revolution does not seem hopeless, nor does it seem like a death sentence. Your efforts, your bravery, the sacrifices of your comrades are all part of a grand miracle that is now carried on you - on your shoulders! To give up now would be to give up the very reason why you are here in the first place! Remember, remember what is at stake! Recall why you became a Ghost!&quot;</p><p>Kyle's words began to crack the atmosphere of defeat, the Ghosts' spirits lifting slightly as Kyle continued. &quot;It is through adversity that the pinnacle of humanity is revealed, where the peak of courage, strength and valor is embodied in all of you! Countless times Nest could have crushed us, could have annihilated us, sent all of us back to where we came from. But we stood strong. We stood strong together and said no in the face of utter defeat. We stood strong together to carve our path and make our name be known. For we will not let Versia be overrun by the callous, greedy psychopaths that dominate the government - we will fight! And we will fight no matter where we are: the streets, the hills, the forest, the caves, until our bones creak and our muscles bleed. Even then we shall never give up, because great men fight for something beyond themselves. They fight for a great cause. Do you fight for a great cause!&quot;</p><p>&quot;For a free Versia!&quot; A few of Ghosts chanted back.</p><p>&quot;Are you going to let a minor defeat set you off this cause?&quot;</p><p>&quot;NO!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you going to let Nest gloat over your defeat?&quot;</p><p>&quot;NO!&quot; The Ghosts were beginning to come around, their hearts swayed by the sheer confidence Kyle exuded as well as the belief of their comrades.</p><p>&quot;Then STAND UP!&quot; Kyle punched his fist into the air. &quot;STAND UP FOR FREEDOM! For we fight even in death for a better world - the Ghosts of Versia will carry the dreams and hopes of all those who have gone before us, towards a better future!&quot;</p><p>&quot;FOR A FREE VERSIA!&quot; The Ghosts stood up en masse and roared in full force, the tent shaking a little from the frenzy and subsequent stomping.</p><p>&quot;Good. Gear up. We leave in a day to re-establish ourselves in Desham.&quot; Kyle clenched his fist. &quot;Dismissed!&quot;</p><p>With the morale of the Ghosts now heightened significantly, Kyle began to also plan ahead for the relocation. He moved towards the supply tent, only to see a groggy Feldon barely recovering from the headache, a sheepish smile on his face. &quot;Sorry, boss, I uhh kind of missed the speech. Could you say it again for me?&quot;</p><p>Kyle ignored Feldon and instead got to work. He had Feldon tally up all the collected supplies, as well as organize them into proper backpacks for the workers to carry. There was no wagon or vehicles of any sort - the wheels would not have been able to traverse the soggy mud and piles of trash scattered all around the Rotten Chamber. Having the encampment did not mean that they were free from a monster attack by either the rock spiders or a salamander, and Kyle needed the workers to be as mobile as possible instead of being bogged down in sludge.</p><p>Sasha, too, was slowly recovering, and the hours passed with Kyle restocking everything he needed into his loadout, reloading pellets, and replacing spent arcia crystals. He also used an evacuated arcia etcher to continue crafting explosive projectiles to be utilized in the railguns, serving as his strongest weapon so far.</p><p>It was the twelfth hour since they arrived when a sudden loud booming tremor shook the entire cavern, the pillars of trash jostling slightly. Unlike a usual noxious salamander attack, this tremor seemed to come from the chamber itself, the sound of walls shifting and gnashing against each other amidst hidden mechanisms beyond the walls. <em>That's not good.</em></p><p>&quot;What, what's going on?&quot; Feldon tried to stabilize himself, the shaking enough to knock him over if he did not support his weight on a crate. The Ghosts were all also woken up, scrambling to get their gear and prepare for any incoming fight.</p><p>However, after five minutes, the rumbling completely stopped, with no sign of an imminent attack or ambush. Kyle squinted his eyes in suspicion as he looked around the chamber, the environment has not changed in the slightest. <em>That's not good.</em> He knew that this was a Galactic Era ruin, and any activation of a mechanism meant that either a trap was engaged or that defensive physical barriers were being deployed. &quot;Feldon, do we have anyone out there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Except the forward scouts we sent to Desham, no. No one.&quot; Feldon shook his head.</p><p>&quot;Sasha, are you good enough to move?&quot;</p><p>[Perfectly fine, sir.] Sasha nodded, grabbing her railgun and runic falchion as her two primary weapons.</p><p>&quot;Check the exit tunnel we found last time that led to Desham. Make sure it's still open. Feldon, get all the Ghosts geared up.&quot;</p><p>Sasha nodded and left immediately, sprinting through the Rotten Chamber. The encampment went into high alert, some of the Ghosts nervously looking around as the atmosphere became tense. Kyle too donned everything he needed, the exosuit arm still worn on his right arm. Unfortunately, his worst fears became true, Sasha reporting back that the tunnel to Desham had been closed off. [It looks like the tunnel is sealed off by a door.]</p><p>&quot;Can it be destroyed? Shoot a railgun projectile at it.&quot;</p><p>A dull boom from the distance echoed through the chamber. [No effect, sir. Not even a scratch.]</p><p><em>I never expected my railgun to damage a Galactic Era wall either way.</em> &quot;Feldon, you're with me. Rest of you, stay in this encampment and hold this ground.&quot; Kyle ordered, leaving with Feldon to join Sasha.</p><p>A sturdy metallic door had completely sealed off the tunnel, with no apparent electronics panel next to anything. Kyle tried to use his exosuit arm to wrench the door open but could not find a proper grip, the door leaving no gap. He decided not to use any of the skills, especially when the Rotten Chamber was in an unknown state. <em>For all I know, there could be a new type of creature coming to attack us.</em></p><p>Still, there was no indication of any trial being initiated in the dungeon, which confused Kyle. He spent a few more minutes at the tunnel's door, checking for any potential signs while Feldon and Sasha split up a little further, everyone looking for clues. Suddenly, Feldon shouted out to Kyle. &quot;Uhhh, Boss? Was this here before?&quot;</p><p>Kyle rushed over to Feldon, noticing a sparkling yellow line that was glowing beneath a shallow pool of sludge. The yellow line zigzagged, seemingly heading straight for the tunnel door, but there was no sign of it on the surface of the door nor on the walls around it. <em>Where does this line go...?</em></p><p>Feeling that it was a trap, Kyle traced the line back, but cautiously, not rushing ahead, with Sasha and Feldon bringing up the rear. They could see rock spiders skittering around along the pillars and ceiling of the chamber, though by now, the rock spiders were all far too afraid to fight them, only aggressive when they were near a nest. The yellow line that Kyle followed snaked through the chamber, leading Kyle further and further towards an unexplored part of the rotten chamber, the established arctech lantern route ending.</p><p>In the stretching darkness, the glow of the yellow line became more apparent, going off into the horizon toward the depths of the chamber. None of the Ghosts, including Sasha and Feldon, had explored this far, mostly due to the time taken to traverse here. &quot;We'll need to determine where the line leads. If I'm right, the line should lead us to whatever activated that door closure. Get three squads of Ghosts to come here, and bring enough supplies to set up an intermediate rest point.&quot;</p><p>Under Kyle's orders, a pitstop was setup at the edge of the explored area, a few backpacks hauled to and fro by escorted workers, three squads of Ghosts also lining up. Kyle was not willing to use everyone, unsure of what danger laid ahead. If he had all Ghosts here and they perished, it would make subsequent recovery extremely difficult. Only when he was certain they were ready, did they finally push forward with the investigation.</p><p>The unexplored section of the chamber was not that different, but as they traveled along, the pillars of trash subsided more, replaced instead with decaying mounds of fungi, plants, and dead rock spiders stacked up, their flesh being eaten by bacteria, insects, and other opportunistic flora. This section was further from where the sewage and sludge fell, which meant it received the least nutrients.</p><p>The mud and sludge gradually decreased in prevalence; instead, they were replaced with the original floor of the chamber, smooth dark green stone tiles with a single yellow line trailing through. Arctech lantern posts were set up every length of the way, and it only took about twenty minutes of walking before they finally came upon a corridor similar to the one they had first used to enter the Rotten Chamber. Its end was unknown, but the yellow line stretched all the way inwards.</p><p>&quot;One squad stays here to guard the entrance.&quot; Kyle motioned with his hands. &quot;Two squads follow us in.&quot; They delved into the mysterious corridor, the same dark green stone tiles used to form its surface. However, Kyle suddenly began to notice that the once intricate decorations were suddenly far more recognizable. <em>I know these drawings.</em> Even Feldon and Sasha were aware of it, their eyes unable to look away from the beautiful drawings that glittered like stars even with the arctech lantern posts set up in sequence.</p><p>The ramifications of the engravings made Kyle pause immediately, having doubts about his plan for the first time in a long while. <em>The yellow line could be leading us to a trap. If these drawings are the same one I know, then the entire squad of Ghosts may very well be annihilated. I can't afford that.</em> The Ghosts did not have the same System skills that Kyle did, and he would not be able to protect them all from what was to come. &quot;Both squads, return to the encampment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot; The Ghosts were confused by the sudden order.</p><p>&quot;That's an order. Only Feldon, Sasha, and I will proceed. This is the best way forward.&quot; Kyle urged, forcing them to retreat back down the corridor.</p><p>Feldon and Sasha, too, were stunned by Kyle's decision. &quot;What's going on? What's going to happen?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not know, but if I'm right, the more people we have with us, the more dangerous it will be,&quot; Kyle murmured cryptically, leaving Feldon and Sasha confused, though they still carried on down the corridor.</p><p>The corridor was just as long as the first corridor, though Feldon paid much more attention to the drawings on the walls. &quot;You know, looking at it now, it feels like its a story. Let's see here... five spheres were carried around in darkness, but one of them was polished too hard...? I think I'm reading this entirely wrong.&quot;</p><p>[Sir, can you give us any hint as to what is to come?] Sasha asked telepathically.</p><p>&quot;A beast so great that even I may have a hard time killing it. In fact, I'm not entirely sure if we will be able to kill it.&quot; Kyle spoke, Feldon, yelping in fright.</p><p>&quot;Then what the hell are we doing? We should turn back, too!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. We need that tunnel exit open, and this yellow line is probably the one activating it. We're not going to fight the beast; we're simply going to open the tunnel door. I will not fight the beast head-on unless it is absolutely necessary.&quot;</p><p>Feldon gulped instinctively, his legs shivering with each step, while Sasha held a grim expression, checking her railgun again once more to assure herself that she was ready. After walking for another fifteen minutes, the end of the corridor became visible once more, but this time there was a bright light coming from beyond, much unlike the dim ambient luminescence of the algae around.</p><p>Kyle squinted his eyes as he entered a new cavern with Feldon and Sasha, the light from the ceiling blinding and forcing his eyes to adjust accordingly. As his vision began to stabilize, he noticed the layout of the cavern was extremely strange. There was almost nothing inside, the chamber completely clean and devoid of any form of life, save for five gigantic pillars that towered more than five stories high, arranged in a pentagram around a central square. There were three other doors placed around the edge of the chamber, all of them sealed save for the corridor from which they came.</p><p>At the very center of the square, there too was a single pillar three meters high, except there was a woman tied to it, her arms bound around it while her face was locked in an expression of pain. The lower half of her body was missing, while her ribs seemed to have merged with the pillar itself. Her hair was long enough to stretch to the base of the pillar, clearly showing that she had been here a long time.</p><p>Feldon internally shrieked, clutching his repeater as tight to his chest as possible. &quot;Who the fuck is that? What is someone doing down here?&quot; Feldon's voice could be heard through the chamber, yet the lady was unresponsive, her eyes apparently looking upwards to the bright light.</p><p>Kyle looked up at the source of the light before noticing that it was a gigantic arcia crystal, its radiance dazzling while the reflections showed an assortment of colors. He intuitively felt that something was off, but not because of the strange layout. <em>Weird, those drawings were clearly indicative of an alien ritual. Yet I don't see any sign of the ritual here. Was it a fake?</em>&quot;Check the surroundings first. Look out for traps. Pressure plates, that sort.&quot;</p><p>The three split up carefully, and each step was measured as they walked through the chamber. There was almost no place to hide, with the granite floor being cleaned. Not even a speck of dust could be found on the floor, as though it had been regularly cleaned. However, there were no other signs of life save for the lady in the center.</p><p>&quot;No way in hell we're going to touch her, are we?&quot; Feldon gingerly asked, but he already knew the answer in his heart. All three of them could see that the yellow line stretched towards her, ending at her pillar itself.</p><p>&quot;Get ready for anything,&quot; Kyle warned, but even now, he did not know what was about to happen. Everything here was new to him, and he had no System messages to inform him of what was going on in the first place. He considered using the railgun to blow off the lady in the center, but he was worried about damaging any potential electronics or control mechanism necessary to re-open the exit of the Rotten Chamber. &quot;Sasha, take up a sniper position on the left. Feldon, on the right. If I say run, you run for the exit immediately, no questions asked. Understood?&quot;</p><p>Sasha and Feldon nodded, taking up their positions and preparing for the worst. Kyle knew that the moment he approached the lady, something strange was going to happen. <em>It could be a Trial or worse.</em> He cautiously approached the square, inching forward slowly while ready to fight at the drop of a hat. The lady did not respond to Kyle's movements; her gaze locked onto the gigantic crystal embedded into the ceiling.</p><p>As Kyle got nearer, he noticed that the lady's body was not exactly human. Three large glowing marble-like spheres had been placed in her shoulder, chest, and face, and arcia energy was continuously pulsating in and out of her body. Even when Kyle got within a centimeter of her, nothing happened at all. No message popped out, and Kyle didn't sense any ambush about to happen. <em>What the hell is going on?</em></p><p>He investigated the pillar the lady was bound to, noticing that it was devoid of any drawings like the one he had seen in the corridor. Based on his estimates, the pillar seemed to have been placed here fairly recently, about a century ago or so. Going around the back of the pillar, he spotted an electronics panel, the yellow line disappearing into it. Flicking the panel open, he saw a simple switch box; some of the switches were activated, while others were not. Using his knowledge of circuitry from his former life, he carefully ascertained which switch toggled the yellow line.</p><p>With a flick of the correct switch, the yellow line instantly turned off, a low rumbling sound just like before activating. &quot;Yes, we did it!&quot; Feldon cheered but quickly clutched his mouth in case he woke up the lady. Still, despite Kyle's actions and Feldon's impromptu celebration, the lady did not react at all, the arcia energy still pulsating steadily.</p><p><em>This place is far too strange.</em> &quot;Let's head back quickly.&quot; Kyle was about to step away from the pillar when he saw a red line shoot out from the pillar, but instead of tracing back the path of the yellow line, it shot forward to another door on the opposite end, opening it to reveal yet another corridor. He quickly aimed his railgun at the door, expecting a creature or an attack to come out from it, but to his surprise, there was nothing at all, the red line trailing off into the distance as well.</p><p>&quot;We don't need to follow that red line, do we? We already got the tunnel open!&quot; Feldon urged, and Kyle agreed, too. It wasn't worth the risk, especially when he did not know what to expect further into the dungeon. <em>I should come back later and figure out what is happening. After I control Versia.</em></p><p>Feldon let out a sigh of relief as they retreated back down the corridor without incident, though Kyle remained completely clueless as to why no trap had been sprung. <em>I was certain that something terrible was going to happen there... is it because of my status as an Administrator?</em></p><p>As they reached the exit of the corridor, another low rumbling could be heard, though the yellow line did not appear again. &quot;Back to the encampment, then we should be ready to move out. Pack up the intermediate point. Send one squad to check that the tunnel is open.&quot; Kyle got the Ghosts back on track, with the forward squad confirming that the tunnel's door was now indeed open. However, as soon as they began to move away, a sudden bolt of lighting erupted without any warning, lancing through the corridor they had just come out from. The lighting bolt turned out to be a sword, the sonic boom blasting the Ghosts apart while it tore through whoever was unfortunate to be in front of its path, searing a gaping hole through their bodies and killing three.</p><p>The sword was aimed right at Kyle, who quickly used his exosuit arm to deflect it, sending the sword spiraling out of the way and lodging itself into the ground. The sudden attack caught Kyle off-guard, only now noticing that there was a lone man approaching from behind, three swords strapped to his back while he had a sword in each arm. He walked calmly as the surviving Ghosts fanned out while the workers scrambled for safety, arcs of lightning running up and down the swords as the lone man glared at Kyle with a killing gaze.</p><p>&quot;Trying to steal my dungeon and leave? That's not very nice of you now, is it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 117 - Transcendent</strong></p><p>Before the lone man could wind up another attack, Kyle brought his railgun up to bear, firing a single explosive round right at him. Without looking for the impact, Kyle quickly signaled with his hand for the Ghosts to take cover. Their battle training over the last few months kicked in like clockwork, each of them diving out of the way and positioning themselves in a staggered form.</p><p>Before the explosive projectile reached the lone man, he raised his left hand and swung downwards in a single slice, cutting the projectile in half. The two halves of the round sailed past him, exploding behind him and illuminating his outline while his short, curly hair fluttered forward in the ensuing shockwave. He wore a foreign outfit with sparse armor: pauldrons, elbow and knee guards, khaki pants with a frilled white shirt befitting that of nobility, not a single stain seen on the shirt itself. Two belts secured the three lightning swords holstered on his back, while sparks of lightning continuously arced between his fingers.</p><p>As he recovered into a standing posture once more, he noticed that all of the Ghosts and Kyle were already scattered across the chamber, fanning out around in a zig-zag pattern that ensured complete coverage of wherever the lone man moved if he took even a step forward. &quot;Interesting...&quot; The lone man muttered under his breath, his eyes cold and calculating as he analyzed the battlefield.</p><p>Kyle did not strike again, knowing the railgun was useless if it did not work in a concentrated strike. [Sasha, flank left slowly, and stay further back. I need you to snipe him while I take the front.]</p><p>[Understood.]</p><p>&quot;Come on, is this how a transcendent fights, by hiding behind normal humans?! Pathetic!&quot; The lone man called out, his voice clearly directed at Kyle. Feldon had a confused look, but Kyle's expression darkened. This was the first time he had heard anyone other than him talk about transcendents out loud, save for Yona before. Instead of replying, he readied his railgun once more, loading in another round.</p><p>&quot;Judging from the way you act... Bekin? Is that you? Well, whatever. Don't blame me for helping myself to these bags of EXP.&quot; A blinding clap of thunder erupted as a lightning sword impaled through Feldon's lower abdomen, the sparking blade piercing through the large rock. The lightning itself seared the flesh, burning it electrically while the hilt knocked Feldon back and sent him tumbling back.</p><p>&quot;Attack!&quot; Kyle roared, the Ghosts all firing in unison as Kyle himself fired yet another railgun round at the transcendent. The transcendent's eyes glinted with power while he drew one of the swords from his back to replace the one he had thrown. Sparks erupted from the edges of his body as he dashed around as fast as lightning itself, each step igniting and searing the ground with booming sonic claps. His movement was hard to hit, the second railgun explosive round sailing harmlessly past him. The first Ghost nearby barely had any time to react to the transcendent's attack, only watching the sudden appearance of a lightning sword swinging towards him, his vision swirling as his head was cut cleanly off, blood still spurting through the neck stump as his body collapsed.</p><p>One by one, the Ghosts fell, most not even knowing what had hit them, while the transcendent carved a bloody path of fury and thunder through them, slaughtering five in just a few seconds with his dual-wielding lightning swords. Just as the transcendent was about to carve up another Ghosts, alarm bells rang in his head as he sensed two railgun rounds approaching him from different angles, intending to pincer him. He leaped upward with grace, slashing cleanly through the two rounds in sequence like a hot knife through butter, the explosions blasting outwards harmlessly on both sides.</p><p><em>I'm losing too many men!</em> Kyle needed them to take Desham and train new recruits - letting this transcendent slaughter all of them would make the bulk of his Versian expedition meaningless. &quot;Retreat!&quot; He roared to the Ghosts charged forward in front, his presence immediately forcing the transcendent to turn around. With a single sonic clap, Kyle saw the transcendent appearing right in front of his face, a dangerous right uppercut swing aimed right at his arm.</p><p>Kyle hurriedly used the railgun to block, the sparks and heat of the lightning sword incinerating the wooden stock. &quot;Wait a minute... you're not Bekin!&quot; The transcendent exclaimed in surprise, as if he wasn't in an important battle at all. &quot;Are you a new contestant sent by Mother?&quot;</p><p>Without replying, Kyle lunged forward, using the butt of the railgun to nail the transcendent in the head. Kyle half-expected the hit not to land, but unexpectedly, the butt crushed against the transcendent's jaw, sending him staggering backward and buying time to recover. The Ghosts were more than willing to comply with Kyle's retreat order, quickly moving away back to the encampment. They picked up Feldon as well on their way back, while Kyle and Sasha remained behind. <em>I need a better weapon.</em> [Sasha, runic falchion!]</p><p>The falchion was hurled through the air, Kyle clasping it in his hand and pushing up against the transcendent, slinging the railgun behind him. Sasha, too, fired one more railgun round, but a sudden burst of energy out from the transcendent sent Kyle and the railgun round spiraling outwards more than five meters. Kyle tumbled on the ground, recovering quickly only to see an infuriated expression on the transcendent's face.</p><p>&quot;Here I am asking you simple questions, and this how you treat me? Who the fuck are you? What clan are you from? I'm going to lodge a fucking complaint against whoever bred you.&quot; The transcendent ranted, stomping up towards the defending Kyle in a childish tantrum. &quot;You better give me a good answer before I wipe you off the face of this fucking continent!&quot;</p><p>Kyle gritted his teeth, preparing for an incoming attack, but soon he noticed that the transcendent's eyes were locked on a corpse behind Kyle, the transcendent's face an expression of pure shock. &quot;Seriously?! Did you kill all of the salamanders here? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! Why the hell would you even do that? ARGGGGGGGHHH, YOU JUST OVERTURNED MY ENTIRE EXP GRINDING PLAN!&quot; The transcendent rubbed his head in frustration.</p><p>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about.&quot; Kyle still kept the runic falchion at the ready in his right hand, his left slowly drawing the Tattoo Knife from its holster without alerting the transcendent.</p><p>&quot;Don't try to fuck with me! I saw you flip that damn switch at the control system, and you got a fucking exosuit arm! You think I was bred yesterday?&quot; The transcendent shot back, but he still did not launch an attack. &quot; Everyone knows it's extremely rude to crash into someone's else dungeon! Did you not fucking check the notice site? I've already booked this dungeon for two more years! You got ten seconds to tell me exactly which fucking clan bred you! Ten!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I really don't know what you're talking about!&quot; Kyle blurted out. [Sasha, get ready. I might need you to come down to fight. This won't be easy.]</p><p>[He doesn't look like he is experienced in dealing with humans. We can take him.]</p><p>&quot;Are you serious?&quot; The transcendent squinted his eyes at Kyle.</p><p>&quot;Yes. I'm just a dungeon explorer, that's all. Heard there were relics.&quot; Kyle bluffed his way, trying to get the transcendent to lower his guard. From his viewpoint, the transcendent was full of openings, yet Kyle knew he could not get a clean strike on the man even if he launched a surprise attack due to the transcendent's speed. <em>That lightning speed must be a skill. What is the cooldown and duration? If I can figure it out...</em></p><p>Weirdly enough, the transcendent began to grin from ear to ear. &quot;A dungeon explorer? That's great! Perfect for what I needed. I'm a bit away from Level 30 for my Race Upgrade - You'll do just fine. No hard feelings.&quot; Without warning, the transcendent lifted his feet again, a lightning arc causing a sonic clap between his shoes and the ground, the angle of the blast enough to propel him forward at an alarming speed.</p><p>The sudden attack caught Kyle off-guard as the transcendent swung a lightning sword with a cross slash from the left, threatening to cut off Kyle's neck. The runic falchion blade blocked the incoming attack in the nick of time, though the kinetic energy of the blow sent Kyle skidding along the mud, his feet drawing lines in the sludge.</p><p>Kyle had no time to recover, seeing another slice headed towards his head. Instead of dodging, Kyle unexpectedly took a forward right into the transcendent's inner arm radius, ducking to tackle the man's body using his shoulder, trying to fling him over in a grapple.</p><p>The transcendent gagged as the force of his own movement worked against him, Kyle's shoulder driving into his gap with full force. However, as soon as Kyle tried to grab the arm and complete the ground slam, a shocking high voltage current lanced through from the elbow guard into Kyle's body. Waves of nerve-numbing pain arced through his body, causing Kyle's muscles to temporarily cramp up.</p><p>Both of them staggered backward, each of them hurt from the exchange and trying to recover. Unfortunately, the transcendent recovered fast, about to rush again at Kyle when yet another railgun round blasted towards the transcendent from behind, Sasha having repositioned. The transcendent grunted as he aborted his attack, turning around to slice the railgun round once more. &quot;I should kill this irritating fly fir-&quot;</p><p>Before the transcendent could complete his sentence, Kyle was already on the attack, stabbing the runic falchion at the transcendent's back. Immediately, the two remaining swords holstered on the back of the transcendent burst out, blocking the runic falchion and trying to knock it out of Kyle's hand. However, Kyle's grip was rock solid, eventually able to overpower the two blocking swords, but another sonic clap had the transcendent retreat to a safe distance from both Sasha and Kyle.</p><p>[Sir, I'm out of explosive rounds. I only had three.] Sasha said through her telepathic channel with Kyle.</p><p>[Switch to medium range with the repeater. I just need you to pin him down and distract him.] Kyle held the falchion up again in a fighting posture, though he noticed the edges of the falchion were slightly burnt from the lightning swords themselves.</p><p>&quot;Since you're unwilling to tell me which clan you're from, then I can only consider you to be a rogue transcendent.&quot; The transcendent twirled his two swords expertly, while the other two floated in the air by some form of unseen control attached to his body via an ever-changing arc of lightning like a tether. &quot;Either I kill you, or I beat you hard enough and drag you back to Mother to sort you out, and then I kill you. How would you like it done?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How about neither?&quot; <em>Intimidation Aura!</em></p><p>The effects kicked in immediately on the transcendent, causing him to stutter and take a step back involuntarily. At the drop of a hat, both Kyle and Sasha kicked into action, Sasha firing a stream of pellets while Kyle stormed forward, closing the gap in three large strides. This time, Kyle aimed at the legs, chopping downward with all his might to stop the transcendent from moving as much.</p><p>The two floating swords kicked into action instantaneously as though they were automatic, one spinning in a furious circle to block the incoming pellets, while the other parried Kyle's falchion even while the transcendent was still rooted to the spot with fear. Activating the exosuit arm, Kyle overpowered the automatic floating sword easily, pushing it away and slicing through the arc of lightning that was its tether. The clean cut had the automatic sword spiral out of control, dropping to the floor uselessly.</p><p>Kyle didn't have another chance to swing the falchion, the transcendent suddenly recovering from the effects of the Intimidation Aura and swinging back. They exchanged blows and parries, Kyle utilizing his runic falchion and Tattoo Knife to go toe to toe with the transcendent. While the transcendent seemed to have the upper hand with his speed and lightning effects, Kyle was slowly winning the fight, cornering the transcendent inch by inch, exposing the transcendent's lack of combat experience against humans.</p><p>Each swing and slash saw the transcendent begin to panic little by little, the transcendent taking a few steps back bit by bit. Just as Kyle was finally about to land a blow with his Tattoo Knife, the aura around the transcendent suddenly changed, the once white dazzling lightning switching to a red hue. &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; The transcendent bellowed with anger; another pulse of energy forced Kyle and Sasha to be pushed back.</p><p>Kyle slammed the falchion into the mud, using it to stop him from being pushed back too far. The pressure suddenly relented, Kyle looking up to see that the last automatic sword was gone now, and the transcendent merging both swords in his hands together, clasping tightly to form a larger greatsword, one masked in an eerie red hue that crackled with lightning energy too.</p><p>&quot;Let's see how much EXP you're worth!&quot; An evil grin erupted on the transcendent's face, his two hands swinging the swords downwards in a single slash. Kyle leaped out of the wave, a wave of red lighting bursting outwards in an energy slice that carved the floor easily, tossing up rock, dirt, and sludge alike into an incinerating column of smoke. Kyle glanced behind, looking at the burning trail. <em>I'm not taking that head-on.</em></p><p>&quot;And you too!&quot; The transcendent did not forget about Sasha, swinging at her as well as she ducked out of the way, a horizontal slice sending a lightning crack that burst against the walls of the chambers, chipping it slightly. The panels of the wall fell apart, revealing intricate electronics and sensors with beeping lights inside.</p><p>Kyle and Sasha backed off from the battle zone, dodging and weaving through the slashes. The transcendent was more than content to give chase; the battlefield slowly shifted closer and closer toward the center of the Rotten Chamber. Each slash of the greatsword saw pillars of trash that had stood for centuries come collapsing down, electricity sparking between the metallic bits of the refuse as they were overcharged by the lightning.</p><p>[Sasha, get him to strike the wall again!] Kyle urged, while his eyes darted about the piles of trash. Ignoring the broken bodies of rock spiders, scattering red moths and scampering insects, he spotted a long, twisted steel rebar pole lodged in the trash. Sheathing his runic falchion and picking it up, he watched as Sasha taunted the transcendent, firing more pellets at him.</p><p>&quot;You irritating little shit! Do you really think those pellets are going to do anything?!&quot; The transcendent roared, unleashing a slash at Sasha, who again leaped out of the way. Just like before, the slash broke the panels on the wall, unveiling electronics embedded within.</p><p>Before the transcendent could wind up another swing, Kyle lunged at him, jabbing forward with his Tattoo Knife, expecting the swings of the transcendent to be slower given the larger size of the sword. Unfortunately, the transcendent reacted as quickly as before, easily parrying the hit, the Tattoo Knife being cut cleanly through by the empowered greatsword. <em>Shit!</em></p><p>Kyle leapt back, the transcendent not letting up as he gave chase, swinging at Kyle while Kyle backpedalled towards the wall, dodging and weaving through the energy slices thrown at him. With his exosuit arm, Kyle gritted his teeth and smashed the steel rebar pole into the electronics, before ducking out of the way again as another slash struck where he had been standing just a second ago.</p><p>&quot;Idiot, are you trying to destroy the dungeon? There's a limit to how much - GUH!&quot; The transcendent was caught in the middle of taunting, the arcing lightning that was gathered around his body suddenly being absorbed by the steel rebar pole, the pole acting like a lightning rod. The transcendent gasped and struggled to move, but the lightning attraction was drawing him back, sucking up all of his excess lightning energy to an unknown ground.</p><p>Lines and lights began to flicker on in the dungeon, absorbing power bit by bit. The originally dim lightning of the Rotten Chamber was replaced by bright floodlights enhanced by the transcendent's energy. Sasha and Kyle watched on as the transcendent twitched and flailed helpless, before the lightning finally died out, his body collapsing to the floor.</p><p>[NOW!] Kyle roared in his mind as he lunged forward, drawing his runic falchion, with Sasha also bringing her rifle to bear. However, a sudden recognizable sonic clap erupted from the transcendent's body. Kyle immediately stopped his attack, swiveling around to block a white lightning sword that slashed against the blade of the falchion, drawing sparks.</p><p>&quot;What kind of a transcendent would I be if I couldn't stop my own skill?&quot; The transcendent smirked, having lured Kyle inwards. &quot;You're not the first idiot to try that on me!&quot; Kyle was pushed back by the transcendent's sudden strength, though it was not as powerful as the red lightning transformation that he had experienced just now.</p><p>Kyle stepped back, with Sasha continuing to fire. Instead of an automatic sword blocking the pellets, the transcendent simply aimed his hands outwards, an arc of lightning lancing out towards her and nailing her right in the chest, sending her spiraling onto a heap of trash. &quot;Enough bullshit. You're strong. I give you that. You and I, one on one. No butlers, and certainly no dumbass mules.&quot; The transcendent spat with derision at Sasha's collapsed but still breathing body. &quot;If that's all you got, then you deserved to die anyway!&quot;</p><p>A bolt of lightning shot out towards Kyle from the transcendent's hand too, threatening to knock him out as well. However, Kyle's reaction time was faster, allowing him to use the falchion to deflect most of it. Some of the residual shock still ran through his body, the voltage looking for a way out through his boots.</p><p>The transcendent stepped forward once more, unleashing a brutal, vicious combo with his default dual-wielded lightning swords, returning to his standard form. Kyle blocked and parried, only left with the runic falchion now that his Tattoo Knife was broken in half. Kyle had to utilize the railgun on his back to fend off a few attacks, expertly twisting and using his body in its most efficient manner. Unlike their first exchange, Kyle could tell that the transcendent was slowly learning how to fight back as well. <em>He's learning too fast!</em></p><p>Blood thumped in his ears while his muscles strained to the limit, each counterattack pushing his endurance to the maximum, each block numbing his bombs. His thighs screamed for rest with each step, but Kyle clenched his teeth hard, knowing that this was the hardest he had ever been pushed since coming to Raktor. Memories of his vigorous decades of Dynasty martial training, as well as a century of skirmishes as a crime lord, began to flood his brain, his mental fortitude stronger than ever.</p><p>Kyle's aura began to grow more menacing by the minute, each foot he stepped forward unleashing a domineering aura that even the confident transcendent found hard to ignore. As the transcendent tried to rationalize what was happening, he was suddenly hit in the arm by the barrel tip of the railgun, a momentary lapse in judgment allowing Kyle to get an attack in. Before the transcendent could figure it out, it was already too late. Kyle's fighting style completely changed, and his movements were now unperceivable. Whatever moves the transcendent had learned to counter Kyle were now useless, Kyle utilizing his legs more than ever, relying on his exosuit arm to block some of the grazing hits of the lightning sword.</p><p>&quot;Dammit!&quot; The transcendent tried to take a step back to create some distance, but Kyle stepped in even closer, his fighting style changing once again as he swapped over to his fists and knees, swapping to an extremely close combat style. A few hits landed on the transcendent's thighs and chest, causing him to stagger back. In a blink of an eye, Kyle's movements were switched up once more, light on his feet as he jabbed in and out, as light as a feather.</p><p>Even as the transcendent tried to use his sonic clap movement, Kyle was already for where he was going to appear, either launching a strike or defending aptly. <em>I know the durations between sonic claps now. I do not know the maximum number of uses, but it is every ten seconds.</em> Kyle kept this gap in his mind, utilizing it for his own benefit. Every time it hit ten seconds, Kyle would relent a little, allowing a gap for the transcendent to use it and then predict his movements.</p><p>As the battle drew on, it became even more apparent that the transcendent was on the losing foot. None of his lightning skills were working any longer on Kyle. Desperate, the transcendent used another sonic clap, this time launching himself high into the air unexpectedly. &quot;RAYNER!!!&quot; The transcendent roared out a cry for help, startling Kyle. <em>There's another transcendent?! I have to take him out now! Penchant for Violence!</em></p><p>Kyle had been taking a measured approach, unsure of what other tricks the transcendent had in the bag. However, if another transcendent were to join in the fray, Kyle would not be sure how he could deal with it, especially with Sasha knocked out for the count and Feldon severely injuried. If he wanted to strike, it was now.</p><p>The transcendent fell back to the ground, his eyes widening as he realized he was unable to dodge Kyle's mid-air attack, his sonic clap on cooldown. He could only watch as Kyle launched himself up into the air as well, aiming his exosuit right fist at him. The transcendent hurriedly blocked the incoming punch with his dual swords, but unexpectedly, Kyle's strength was increased tremendously, the blow sending him spiraling back, slamming into pillars of trash in sequence before tumbling onto the floor in an injured heap.</p><p>Before the transcendent could get up, Kyle was already on top of him, delivering one more blow that smashed the jaw of the transcendent in, concussing him. The transcendent dropped the lightning swords, both of them losing their lightning effects. Kyle immediately used his exosuit arm and crushed both lightning swords with his exosuit arm, unwilling to let the enemy have it any longer.</p><p>The transcendent was grabbed by the collar of his white shirt and dragged along the muddy ground into a nearby cave, his consciousness fading in and out. As his vision slowly stabilized back, he soon began to struggle hard. He gripped onto Kyle's back, trying to send a voltage in to shock Kyle. However, Kyle's body seemed almost unaffected by it, Kyle simply punching him in the back of the head again.</p><p>Kyle quickly forced the door at the end of the cave open, revealing the same laser prison cell that he had discovered on his first exploration of the Rotten Chamber. He immediately tossed the transcendent into one of the cells, plugging in the battery and activating the laser cutters. The transcendent was still groggy, struggling to get up to his feet, when he saw Kyle walking away from the cell. He tried to summon a lightning arc from his hand, but he somehow just couldn't. &quot;What... what happened to my System?! What the fuck did you do!&quot;</p><p>A loud tremoring boom resounded through the cell, alerting Kyle to danger outside. Kyle didn't care to reply to the transcendent, leaving him in the prison cell while he rushed out, tapping his arctech radio. <em>Is the other transcendent already here?!</em> [Report, status on Ghosts!]</p><p>[Sir, we're under attack! An unknown person is breaking into our encampment.] A frantic Ghost voice came over the radio.</p><p><em>Shit!</em> However, Kyle did not rush over just yet, instead heading to Sasha and checking up on her. She was still unconscious, the lightning blow having reignited her injuries from the battle with Nest just 12 hours ago. Kyle quickly poured a health potion down her mouth but did not linger around anymore. He sprinted as fast as he could back to the encampment, seeing fire and smoke already spiraling in the distance, rivaling the pillars of trash.</p><p>The encampment was a disaster, with most of the supplies damaged and blown out, stored explosives having been ignited by what seemed to be stray pellet fire. A dozen Ghosts were still fighting in the midst of the encampment; some of them had already died on the spot, their bodies strewn across the ravaged tents and broken crates, workers scrambling to salvage what they could and evacuate further.</p><p>In the very center, amidst a burning flame, a strange man stood, dressed in a full khaki explorer-style outfit that was slightly similar to what the first transcendent was wearing. However, Kyle could already see something different - the Ghosts have already hit him directly a few times, yet he was still standing, unhurt. His human skin had peeled off to reveal a metallic robotic case underneath, deflecting any pellets that the Ghosts sent at him, even those that had been empowered by a poor arcia crystal.</p><p>The strange man's eyes locked onto Kyle, ignoring the barrage of pellets that only seemed to tickle him. &quot;Where is Master Soren?&quot; The strange man spoke with a monotone voice, confirming Kyle's assumptions. <em>He's a cyborg! I have to end it fast before he learns my moves!</em> Kyle had decades of experience fighting them in the Galactic Era, knowing that they were extremely dangerous and far easier to train than the regular, un-modified humans. Each second he wasted would lead to more problems, and he was already accumulating losses far more than he could accept.</p><p>The moment Kyle took a step forward, the cyborg raised his arm and launched forward a green dart. Kyle raised his exosuit arm to block the dart, only for the dart to suddenly light up and send a surge of arcia energy into the arm. The arm began to transform into ice at the point of impact, forcing Kyle to quickly take off the arm.</p><p>&quot;You're not registered in the databa-&quot; The cyborg quickly raised both his arms, blocking a hit from Kyle's runic falchion. Before the cyborg could move, Kyle already lunged forward with his other free hand, clutching onto the robotic chest of the cyborg and gripping as hard as he could.</p><p><em>This Is My Turf!</em> Instead of pushing the cyborg aside, Kyle toggled the friend-or-foe setting of the barrier to only allow steel in. The strength of the barrier began to rip the cyborg apart, and every other alloy and element within began to strain as they were stretched. The cyborg's voice became garbled immediately while its body was split apart into two, the various electronics, wires, and sensors, as well as motors, all being stripped from its steel frame.</p><p>The cyborg's human skin itself was also elongated as it tried to cling onto the skin, but its body could not respond under the sheer intensity of the barrier. Before long, the entire innards of the cyborg have been evacuated by the barrier, leaving only just a skeleton of the cyborg behind.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Rayner, +500 EXP. </p><p></p><p>Kyle huffed and panted, tossing the frame of the cyborg aside onto the ground. He used his arm to wipe the grime and dirt off his face, noticing that it was stained with blood too. He had suffered a few hits from the transcendent during the exchange, and thankfully, this cyborg was far easier to deal with. He could have used the barrier skill on the other transcendent, but it was far too dangerous to use a high cooldown skill to an ambiguous outcome. <em>Looks like I was right to pace out the usage of my skills.</em></p><p>&quot;Clean up the encampment and pack all of this into a sack. We'll move in by the end of the day. It's far too dangerous to stay here.&quot; Kyle motioned to the scattered electronics and sensors of the cyborg. &quot;Get Sasha back here and use all potions now, do not ration them. We need to be at our best.&quot; He didn't know if there would be another transcendent coming or not, so he made up his mind to move as quickly as possible. However, he still had one more thing to do.</p><p>Returning back to the laser prison cell, he entered to see 'Master Soren' gingerly using his fingers to try and inch out between the gaps of the laser fence that made up his cell, aiming for the nearby exposed panel, though it was just out of reach. The moment Soren spotted Kyle enter, he immediately recoiled, scrambling back as far away into the cell as possible.</p><p>Kyle walked up to the cell, unexpectedly unplugging the battery from the cell's panel and disabling the laser fence. Soren's eyes widened in confusion, carefully watching as Kyle stepped into the cell. The same sudden loss of strength could be felt, but Kyle had been expecting it, his nerves steeled against the decrease in stats. Without warning, Soren lunged forward, throwing a punch at Kyle as hard as he could. The punch was stopped just before it hit Kyle's face, Kyle clenching hard onto it.</p><p>&quot;So you think you could beat me when I don't have a System,&quot; Kyle smirked, grabbing Soren by the neck and slamming his knee into Soren's guts. Soren gagged as he collapsed onto the floor while Kyle's hand clenched tightly onto Soren's head, squeezing through his hair and lifting him up to be face to face with Kyle.</p><p>&quot;I got bad news for you, kid. The System isn't what makes me strong. I am what makes the System strong. Now, I can either kill you, or you can start talking, and then I'll kill you. How would you like it done?&quot;</p><p><strong>Chapter 118 - Prison</strong></p><p>&quot;How about neither?&quot; Soren grinned, the transcendent still cocky even though his teeth was bloodied and he was bruised all over his body. &quot;Soon enough, Rayner is going to come and kick your ass, you filthy rogue cunt.&quot; He spat with derision, earning him another slam into the ground, his mouth eating the centuries-old dirt and soot coating the cell's floor.</p><p>&quot;I already killed your cyborg.&quot; Kyle stated clearly. &quot;I guess I will have to kill you as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pfft. You can't have killed Rayner. Like you actually dare to kill someone of- ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHH&quot; Soren let out a harrowing scream as Kyle chopped deep into Soren's left wrist with the runic falchion, the metal biting into the bone and severing nerves. Soren struggled and writhe on the ground, but a firm boot from Kyle's soles held the flailing transcendent in place as Kyle steadily began sawing away, his normal strength not enough to cut cleanly through the transcendent's bones.</p><p>&quot;WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, I'LL TELL YOU! PLEASE! STOP!&quot; Soren devolving into a sobbing mess, his words turning into whimpers of pain just like any scared teenager. Kyle relented, lifting his falchion out as blood spurt out of the wound, Soren immediately clasping it tightly towards his chest, red stains spreading across his white frilly shirt rapidly.</p><p>&quot;Glad we're on the same page.&quot; Kyle flicked the falchion, the blood splattering off the blade in an arc. &quot;Now, I'm going to ask some questions, and you will answer. Clear?&quot;</p><p>Soren nodded vigorously in response, as Kyle began to twirl the falchion around expertly while pacing across the cell.</p><p>&quot;The cyborg called you Master Soren. How many cyborgs do you have here?&quot; Kyle wanted to ascertain the level of enemy he was fighting with first.</p><p>&quot;Just the one.&quot; Soren murmured, wincing due to the intermittent jolting pain through his exposed wrist bone, his left hand still dangling slightly. Interestingly, Kyle noticed that Soren's wounds was beginning to regenerate, even without the System itself. <em>Clearly genetically modified.</em></p><p>Instead of questioning any further, Kyle raised his falchion, preparing to chop again when Soren held out his one good hand in surrender, waving frantically as he backpedalled away from Kyle. &quot;WAIT! WAIT! I'm not lying! We're only allowed to take one with us!&quot;</p><p><em>Allowed?</em> &quot;Who 'allowed' you? Who makes the rules?&quot;</p><p>Soren stared at Kyle as if Kyle was the dumbest idiot to have ever lived, before his eyes landed on the runic falchion once more, gulping instinctively. &quot;Mother, of course. Who else?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who is this... Mother?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mother is Mother. I don't know how else to say it...&quot; Soren looked around nervously, instinctively already preparing to shield himself from another possible attack. &quot;I've only met her once, and it wasn't in person! I swear! I never seen her face before!&quot;</p><p><em>So a virtual meeting. Holograms? A.I.?</em> Kyle did not rule out the possibility of this 'Mother' being a super intellgience or a synthetic lifeform, hidden away on this planet. His pondering expression was taken for fear, Soren gaining a slight bit of confidence, a smile slowly growing on Soren's face.</p><p>&quot;Now you know what you're dealing with, huh? Even if you are from beyond the Great Waves, you should know very well who Mother is!&quot; Soren gleefully taunted. &quot;Once I get out of this dungeon, Mother will know about you and send people to slaughter you!&quot;</p><p>Kyle only had an incredulous look for the hapless Soren. &quot;Get out of the dungeon? You're not going anywhere.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yeah?! It's been already twenty mintues since you disabled my System - any second now and you'll never see me again!&quot; Soren gritted his teeth, his face straining as though he was trying to activate a skill. His face reddened with exhaustion, before exhaling loudly and trying again, Kyle simply watching on in amusement. &quot;This... this is not possible... I never heard of a Skill that can disable a System for longer than twenty minutes! I... I must have been counting right... I... Right! This must be a test! You're a test sent by Moth-&quot;</p><p>Soren's words were replaced by another scream, this time Kyle jabbing into the calf, penetrating through the bone and ripping through tendons. The transcendent was a pitful sight, clutching both his dangling left hand and wounded leg as he keeled over onto the floor, whatever hallucination or assumptions he had about this being a test evaporating immediately.</p><p>&quot;Are we done playing around?&quot; Kyle glared, not a fan of wasting time. &quot;If you're not going to answer, then I'll find someone else who will.&quot;</p><p>&quot;WAIT! WAIT! No one else is coming to this dungeon, not when I've booked it for two years! &quot; Soren pleaded frantically. &quot;It's the rule of the Wardens!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Wardens...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, the Wardens, and if you want to know about them, you got to keep me safe at least!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Trying to bargain with me?&quot; Kyle raised his falchion once more, Soren immediately bowing low and placing his head on the ground in apology.</p><p>&quot;No, no, not at all! But if you kill me, you will lose your only source of information about who the Wardens is! Isn't that what you wanted to find out? I'll answer all your questions too, as long as you swear to keep me safe. Transcendent's honor!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whether or not you live is something for me to decide, not for you to haggle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Start talking, or my decision to keep you alive may change rapidly.&quot;</p><p>Soren gulped, hurriedly explaining. &quot;The Wardens is the association of all System Users on Continent of Nedrasa!&quot;</p><p><em>All?!</em> Kyle was internally shocked, but he continued to remain stoic, not letting Soren see his emotions. &quot;Go on. What were you doing in the dungeon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Every five years, the Wardens choose the next candidate to join the ranks of real certified Wardens. Each clan can only have a few spots each year, and there's an age limit too. I got the dungeon to train up for the final arena that determines eligibility. It's a known fact that you need a high Level to participate in it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mentioned a person named Bekin during the fight. Who is that, your sibiling? How many sibilings do you have?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know, there's dozens of us, I never really bother to chec-&quot;</p><p>&quot;How many, and give me the names of all those you know!&quot; Kyle pressed.</p><p>&quot;Alright, alright! Bekin, Liyana,... the rest I only know by their assigned digits!&quot;</p><p><em>So the Wardens have a program of sending candidates out into the world, but I haven't seen any till now.</em> Kyle breathed a sigh of relief. <em>It's a good thing I had this prison cell, otherwise my presence would be alerted to the Wardens.</em> He certainly didn't want to deal with another unknown group tracking him down. <em>Best to stay hidden for now.</em> &quot;And this arena happens in two years from now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, three years, actually.&quot; Soren began to massaging his recovering wound, the scab already forming over the shin, while his left hand was slowly regaining its nerves connection. &quot;I was planning to grind for two more years, then get out to kill some bags.&quot;</p><p>Kyle pondered for a moment. &quot;How do you get the System? Does every one of your siblings have it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not - the System isn't given lightly. Only to suitable participants willing to fight for candidacy. Except Bekin. No idea why he got the System, but he certainly isn't the brightest of the bunch.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't give two shits about Bekin.&quot; Kyle sternly warned. &quot;Tell me how do you receive the System.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Frankly, I don't know. I didn't do any special procedure or not, I just had it one day when I woke up in my room. Wasn't based on age or anything - as far as I can tell, the System is entirely meritocratic.&quot;</p><p><em>Strange, seems like the Wardens do not have a handle on the System as well. This means they are not as powerful as I thought they were.</em> Kyle originally postulated the Wardens to be the true masters behind the System, but its clear from Soren's surprise at the laser prison cell as well as their inability to implement the System in all of their siblings that the Wardens was simply a group of System Users at best. Still, he did not want to tangle with them, making up in his mind that Soren was never going to leave this prison cell. <em>Though I don't need to tell him that yet.</em> &quot;Why did you attack my group immediately?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The dungeon was already booked by me! It's known that anyone trespassing, I have the full right to kill! Bag or no bag. And you being a rogue transcendent means theoretically I have to either capture you or kill you on sight as well. Can't have System Users going wild around Nedrasa.&quot; Soren shrugged, not bothered in the slightest by his decision.</p><p>&quot;Who is charge of the Warden and its rules? Mother?&quot;</p><p>&quot;For a rogue transcendent sent from the Great Waves, you're completely out of the loop. Just how bad is your information gathering?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Answer. The. Question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Archivist! The Archivist!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who is that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know, I never met him too!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't believe you. You never met this 'Mother' and you never met the 'Archivist' too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's true! For the Archivist, no one has seen him for the last thirty years!&quot;</p><p><em>Something less to worry about.</em> &quot;How many System Users on the continent right now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhhh... I don't know the exact number... maybe a hundred? five hundred?&quot;</p><p>Kyle groaned internally. Clearly Soren was a fledgling in the Wardens. If he was telling the truth, the information he had was extremely limited at best, and not of use. It was as if the Warden's information security protocol was airtight in the event one of their candidates were to be caught by enemies. The only assurance Kyle had was that there would no way of the Wardens knowing that he had just attacked one of their members. <em>As long as they don't come, we're fine. I can't have another group messing my plans up.</em></p><p>Kyle also did not want to mess with a group of System Users five hundred men strong, clearly a deadly force to be reckoned with. There didn't seem to be any more information he could wring out of Soren that he didn't already ask. He contemplated killing Soren right now to tie up loose ends, but Kyle was never one to give up a free resource when it was ripe for the taking. <em>I always wondered how a System User like me would react to an arcia tattoo. Would their body be able to handle it? Would they be able to resist? And what's the limits of their tolerance?</em></p><p>A captured System user was far too valuable to simply slaughter off - Kyle knew that if he could bring Soren back to the Oracle Chamber, much more information on his circumstances as well as his understanding of how to defeat transcendents would increase dramatically. However, he also had a timeline to meet, needing to move to Desham as soon as possible before Nest found out about the fourth layer and so on.</p><p>Before he decided on a next step, he suddenly kicked Soren over, before rummaging through Soren's pockets and stripping all of the armor away, making sure Soren had nothing to defend himself with. In the midst of the pockets in Soren's explorer pants were mouldy crumbs of breads, a few tin cans of food, and a strange looking dark green stone key, something Kyle felt he recognized before.</p><p>&quot;Hey! That key is mine!&quot; Soren lunged for Kyle's hand, but Kyle simply slapped him away, sending him sprawling into the center of the cell while he walked out. The System was restored to Kyle as he reactivated the laser fence, preventing Soren from escaping the cell at all. &quot;YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO KEEP ME SAFE!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am. This is the safest place by far. Don't worry, I'll keep the door closed for you when I leave.&quot; Kyle grinned as he matched the key against the previously locked heavy door vault, the dark green key fitting in nicely to Soren's horror.</p><p>&quot;THAT LOOT IS MINE! MINE I TELL YOU! I WILL BE A WARDEN WITH THE RELICS! MINEEEE!&quot; Soren went into a raging screech, running up to the laser fence only for him to quickly back off again, stomping the ground in utter frustration while he watched Kyle take the fruits of his labour. &quot;I SPENT THREE MONTHS FINDING THAT DAMN KEY!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good for you.&quot; Kyle entered the vault, noticing that it was a storage room of sorts, except instead of storing plenty of food, water and other supplies, nearly all of the dungeon wall panels, electronics components and other necessities were placed here in crates. <em>Finally, a Galactic Era treasure trove!</em></p><p>However, his expectations diminished rapidly when he saw the state of the electronics. Instead of it being a storage room, it seemed to be a dumping room for broken melted electronics. Kyle spent a few minutes digging through the numerous crates of electronics, blocking out the terrible shrieking from Soren. Resistors, capacitors and inductors were all heavily damaged, as if they had been fully crushed. <em>Still, even broken electronics can be smelted and purified into useful rare-earth metals. I'll have to consider coming back here.</em></p><p>His Ghosts were certainly not in a position to be worried about harvesting Galactic Era relics like these resistors which were a dime a dozen, but Kyle knew he could easily come back to the dungeon anytime, now knowing exactly where the entrance was. As he continued to rummage through the crates, he finally found a fully intact Galactic Era battery pack.</p><p>Moving outside of the vault and slotting the new battery into the main electronics panel, the entire room began to turn on fully, the holographic keyboards, displays and monitors all running at full functionality.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Access Recognized</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Temporary Administrator Privileges recognized. Prison Holdings activated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle tapped a nearby holographic monitor while the wide-eyed Soren stared in shock as Kyle deftly manipulated the keyboard, trying to find information. <em>Looks like there really is a jamming effect on the entire dungeon. The whole dungeon is cut off from the outside world. So unless the Wardens sent someone to check, no one but me will know Soren is here.</em></p><p>With the vault now fully functional as well and lit up, Kyle could now see the full extent of it. At the very end of the supposed storage room were countless metallic pods, their inhabitants unknown. <em>Galactic Era human survivors?</em> He gingerly walked up, peering into the foggy window of one of the pods only to see a frozen human, still stuck in cryostasis. Checking the display panel of the pod, it showed that there was only a 0.1% success chance of waking up the human in the pod as well.</p><p>He readied himself with weapons, though he was extremely confident he could take on a human who had just exited a cryopod, no matter how genetically modified he was. <em>I'll pop the pod, and immediately drag him to the prison cell to prevent any System activation.</em> Assured in his plan, he used his temporary administrator privileges to begin the defrosting procedure.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You killed Company Employee, +5000 EXP</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">Your level has increased from level 29 to level 30!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">All stats increased.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Bonus free points granted.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race Announcement</strong>: Race Upgrade (Level 30)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Race Evolution can now be selected.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Please wait.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Huh? What?</em> Kyle was flabbergasted, watching the pod shudder violently as its inhabitant inside decayed rapidly, the body bloating up before bursting apart as it was rapidly thawed. <em>The kill message said it was a company employee...</em></p><p>However, what truly caught him off guard was the race upgrade announcement. He didn't know that the System could upgrade his race as well, though he wondered what race he would be allowed to select.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race Announcement</strong>: Designated Terminal required for upgrade.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Race options provided upon entry. Terminal Located 10 meters ahead at SD-X-3340-PT-1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>A golden line overlaid on his vision shot out from the center of his body, pointing directly to a square portable chamber that was nested neatly in the corner of the room. Countless tubes and gas tanks were plugged into it, the pipes a maze as they all congregated onto a single surgical bed mounted in the very center of that chamber, the walls glass. A few stains of blood could be seen on the portable chamber's glass walls, making Kyle a little suspicious. However, Kyle had seen such a contraption before in his previous life. <em>It's a gene modifier chamber. Though I never seen one so advanced before.</em></p><p>Dust coated the transparent monitors that were clearly linked to the chamber, with no sign of any mechanical keyboards or interfaces. Kyle sighed, knowing how much confidence the A-class states had in their electronics to survive, some even claiming they could last a hundred thousand years thanks to extensive testing in a time anomaly. <em>Except they never accounted for the fact that their power source might be completely crippled.</em></p><p>A single handprint groove was on the side of the chamber, along with the power cable drawing energy greedily from the battery Kyle had just slotted in.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race Announcement</strong>: </p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Designated Terminal is required for upgrade.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle laid out his plans once more. This put a wrench in his timeline, as he would not be able to move up to Desham as quickly as he would like. If the previous Class Upgrade and Subclass Upgrade was any indication to go by, he might be knocked out for a few days or even more. It would be foolish to leave the Ghosts here waiting, so he hurriedly modified his future plans a little. [Sasha, you're in range?]</p><p>[Yes, sir, fully recovered now.]</p><p>[Take the Ghosts up to Desham. You and Feldon already know the way?]</p><p>[Yes, sir, we've already scouted it.]</p><p>[Good. Go on without me. I have business to settle here with the transcendent. Rebuild the Ghosts up and collect supplies where possible.]</p><p>[Understood.] Sasha took the order to heart immediately, preparing to set off with the Ghosts while Kyle cracked his knuckles, doing his own preparation for the race upgrade himself.</p><p>Thankfully, the storage still had a few rations left behind, preserved to last for centuries, along with a few tanks of water that had been prepared as well. <em>This should be enough if I need to recover.</em> Kyle also had his Necklace of Healing should he be severely weakened from the Race Upgrade, and a few vials of health potion and stamina potion. <em>This upgrade could help me dominate Harrison even more, so let's get it over with.</em></p><p>Before he began, he closed the vault door and locked it tight from within, leaving the still-screeching Soren trapped fully behind the laser cage. He moved over to the chamber, approaching the handprint groove. He readied his runic falchion in the other, prepared to chop off his own hand in the event of an infection or a genetic corruption. It wouldn’t be the first time it has happened to him, either.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Terminal Active</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Warning – No functional terminal found in the next fifty kilometres.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Calculating energy usage. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Would you like to proceed?</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Not yet.</em> Kyle meticulously scoured the room for anything active, along with any possibility of traps. He checked each crack to ensure that a rock spider would not suddenly burst through and kill him while he was unconscious. Playing it safe, he unplugged every cable that was connected, breaking the connection between the chamber and the monitors, as well as the thick power cable. Even the lightning were not spared, Kyle modifying a nearby electronics panel by flicking the switches off until he was confident that the chamber was the only thing powered up. <em>Don’t want anything in this room suddenly powering up at all.</em></p><p>Air was circulating freely from the genetic modification chamber too, pumped out by dormant gas tanks that enriched the atmosphere.Kyle carefully removed his shirt, pants and shoes to prevent them from getting stained. The last few times saw copious amounts of blood staining his outfit, and a crime lord should always take good care of his appearance.</p><p>Already Kyle's body was far different from his starting point as Alvin Teras, the weak sickly skinny frame now turned into a lean musclar machine, though the skin clearly still had some defects. However, the body over all was well-toned with a bit of room for improvement.</p><p>He gingerly entered the gene modification chamber, laying down on the surgical table as the chamber's glass door closed automatically, though he still held onto his runic falchion, ready to fight at a moment's notice. <em>If this chamber tries to kill me, I'm breaking out immediately.</em> Kyle never let his guard down, though it did give him a soothing feeling, reminding him of his own modification procedures back when he was just a kid. <em>Just like the good old days. Right, let's see the options.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race Announcement</strong>: Race Upgrade (Level 30)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Race Evolution choices will now be generated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> WARNING – Irreversible. Please choose wisely.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Three races and their skills appeared in front of him, allowing Kyle to select the races.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Genetic Package 229-A-X Galactic Human</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A designer genetic package for the scions of A-class nobility. Increased necessity for energy in every form as well as controlled nutritional diet and genetic stabilizers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment Per Level Boost: +5 CHA, +5 DEX, +5 STA, +1 MP, +5 HP, +10 INT, +5 STR.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Enchancment (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Push your latent potential to the limits.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment will improve over time with training. Unique Title will be applied at each stage.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Information</strong>: Genetic Package 229-A-X Galactic Human</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Race Upgrade Path can be swapped to other variants later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle had nearly forgotten what it was like to choose a System upgrade. It felt like ages ago when he had just chose the Arcia Mystic subclass. However, this upgrade was even more astounding, forcing him to rub his eyes to ensure that the System Message he was seeing was not a lie. <em>I don't believe it. This genetic package...</em></p><p>He was born as a designer baby with the 229-D-X variant in his former life, targeted for D-class states. This had originally put him above his peers, costing nearly an entire space habitat to both grow, nuture and sustain. With greater energy output, metabolism and calorie consumption increases as well - conservation of energy still had to be met in all cases. He owed his former glory and status as a Crime Lord to the 229-D-X, and he never truly had the chance to upgrade to a 229-C-X due to his age when he finally had the funds to. To see a 229-A-X package here, free for the taking was almost forcing Kyle to click instantly.</p><p><em>The cost of the A-class genetic package could buy out an entire planet in a D-class state. Maybe even the capital of a D-class state.</em></p><p>Not even mentioning the reputation of the genetic package, Kyle was flabbergasted at the sheer number of stats. <em>+5 for every level on top of the base +3, with a +10 for INT?!</em> The Enhancement Passive was even more jaw-dropping, with hints that the per-level increment of stats could reach more than what was shown here.</p><p>Before Kyle got far too emotionally invested in chasing what he failed to obtain in his previous life, he quickly looked at the next two races.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Arimorph</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A human variant designed by Werter Fluidics, it was ordered by the Bulin Principality in their efforts to improve the success of espionage operations.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment Per Level Boost: +2 CHA, +4 DEX, +3 STA, +3 INT, -1 STR.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: You Can’t See Me (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Blend into the crowd with a new face every day.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Up to four templates can be saved. <strong>Duration</strong>: Three hours. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: One Day.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Boneshifting (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Craft the skeleton you always wanted</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Three hours. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: One Day.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle was not a fan of alien-hybrid variants. Even in his former life, he had long eschewed such abominations, though the race presented was overall interesting, and showed him a possibility that he could have taken. <em>Boneshifting already looks like a monstrous ability – but I’ll have to see if the others are better.</em> While the second skill intrigued Kyle, the first skill hardly impressed him as optical illusions were already available.</p><p>Granted, it did not require arcia energy to channel and could be done nearly instantly without having to prepare different suits altogether, but Kyle was already planning to improve on the optical illusion engravings and bring them closer to Galactic Era illusion technology. <em>Let's check the next race.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Slovesa-Human Hybrid (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A human variant developed in the Loeric Empire, this combines the best of both human and slovesa attributes.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment Per Level Boost: -2 CHA, +2 DEX, +3 STA, +2 HP, +1 INT, +4 STR.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Stoneskin (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Reject carbon, accept silicon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Ten minutes. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: One Hour.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Energy Core (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Because one more organ couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Passive</strong>. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle was shocked to see the race appear. After all, he was complicit in the creation of this variant, he himself being the biggest funder of the entire research project that was highly classified. <em>Did the A-class State that built this System steal the information from us?</em></p><p>However, he was not enticed by the prospects of becoming a slovesa hybrid – he had seen the shortcomings of it in the various field tests and in the liberation war that eventually led him to become a Crime Lord. <em>Unlike a true slovesa, these hybrids can’t survive in space, and they can’t survive in a normal human environment as well without proper support. It's the worst of both worlds.</em></p><p>The energy core required intense radiation, making it such that the hybrids could only live on moons or planets with low magnetic shielding or staying close to radioactive sources. The hybrids could also not integrate exotic materials in the same way that the slovesas could naturally. Kyle was not planning to limit himself in that way – there were hardly any radioactive sources found here yet that could be exploited enmasse.</p><p><em>Out of these three, I would pick the 229-A-X for sure. But I know this damn System always has more to give.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race Announcement</strong>: Race Upgrade (Level 30)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Three more choices generated</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> WARNING – Irreversible. Please choose wisely.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the System generated another three races the moment Kyle's thought popped into his head. He quickly flicked through the selection once more, starting from the top of the new batch.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Vicronoth</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A stable human genetic mutation that naturally occurred during the Vicrophage.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment Per Level Boost: -2 CHA, +2 DEX, +3 STA, +2 HP, +1 INT, +4 STR.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Infection Vector (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Be the first horseman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Two minutes. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: Three Hours. Infection lasts in target after duration.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Viral Immunity (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">You merely adopted the vaccine, but I was born in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Passive</strong>. Major immunity boosts to nearly all known diseases.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>The viral immunity is good – it might work against the debilitating poison. However, I’m not convinced that it is worth going down this racial upgrade path.</em> The issue with the skills was that all of them could be obtained if he had access to Galactic Era tech. The existence of the cyborg Rayner already hinted that there was the existence of factories who could produce Galactic Era technology and implement cybernetic surgery as well. If something was in reach, he didn't want to waste the System upgrade to take it. <em>I could modify my own body myself in the future, it would be shame to give up the 229-A-X package for this.</em></p><p>Kyle swiped to the next race.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Orisian</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A humanoid alien race, with clear signs of telepathic and psychic inclinations</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment Per Level Boost: +2 CHA, -4 DEX, -2 STA, +2MP, +1 HP, +7 INT, +1 STR.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Overpowering Will (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Unleash your inner strength and dominate the others</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Ten minutes. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: Thirty Minutes.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Telekinesis (Intermediate)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">One of the great mysteries of the Galactic Era.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Duration</strong>: Five Minutes. <strong>Cooldown</strong>: One hour.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Telekinesis?</em> Kyle was shocked. Humans had never really obtained the true power of telekinesis, even through genetic manipulation, when he was still alive in the Galactic Era. <em>Just how far have I travelled into the future that an A-class state is able to do it?</em></p><p>He suspected this race might be a complete overhaul of the human genome. From what he recalled of the Orisians, they had a hidden requirement of having to stay near an equally psionic active exotic that seemed to work a completely unseen type of wave, analogous to how dark matter was viewed in Ancient Earth. <em>Have they finally cracked the code? Does arcia allow for telekinesis?</em></p><p>Kyle was a bit wary, not wanting to be solely reliant on the exotic. Every Orisian prisoner captured from their homeworld away from the exotics eventually went braindead even if they willingly left their home planet, but not before causing an absolute disaster with their raging telekinesis abilities. He also felt that if the System could implement it, then he could also eventually figure out an arctech engraving to replicate the skill itself. <em>What arcia can't replicate is the 229-A-X package. It's still too good to give up! Alright, let's see the next one.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Tharapon</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A human variant created by the Poharos Corporation, it allows for shifting in the fourth dimension.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment Per Level Boost: +1 CHA, +4 DEX, +1 STA, +2 MP, -2 HP, +3 INT, -1 STR.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Dimensional Shift (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>A blip on the axis suddenly becomes two.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Performing all three shifts in rapid succession will result in extreme exhaustion.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Only one skill?</em> Kyle was intrigued by the skill but not too surprised. Dimensional defenses were not unique in the Galactic Era – starships got around by entering the fourth dimension; otherwise, humanity would have never been able to enter the galactic stage.</p><p>It looked extremely useful, but it seemed that it would not be able to dodge chemical attacks like the black fog or any skill that had a lingering effect in an area. If each attack counted for a shift, he would run out of shifts in the first three bullets of a repeater. Of course, he could bulk it up with a point defense engraving, but then the skill becomes less critical to use.</p><p><em>I’m not really into this. If I could use it for teleportation, then yes. But as it is, it’s teleportation on the spot, with no sign of there being an upgrade path.</em> Kyle has not heard of any human variants that could teleport, not considering some transcendents. As such, he had little hope that the human variant Tharapon would be able to reach there someday.</p><p>His heart sank a little, feeling as though none of the races so far were interesting enough to outweigh the benefits of the 229-A-X package shown first. One of the more important hidden details is that any variant he chose would undoubtedly have his external features changed entirely.</p><p>As if in response to his feelings, the System whirred into life once more.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race Announcement</strong>: Race Upgrade (Level 30)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>Huh. With this, I could actually just leave the planet myself.</em> Kyle considered the race carefully. This would give him the best survivability not just in space but also on the ground, with him being able to absorb starlight directly, such as UV radiation and so on.</p><p>But the second skill was completely useless, save for the fact that it could irradiate and overwhelm electronic components. However, most Galactic Era technology was already hardened for radiation on a general basis. In order to overwhelm the significant radiation shielding, he would have to generate more particles than a sunspot, all concentrated onto a centimeter square. <em>That’s not going to work.</em></p><p>Kyle highly doubted his body would be able to fire harder than a particle cannon, which was effectively the same concept albeit they melted through the surface of whatever material they were touching. There was no way he could accelerate the particle that fast – the energy pulse seemed to be more of a solar sail effect rather than a rocket engine or a true particle ion thruster, with the general acceleration being low but continuous.</p><p>The first skill was still worthy of consideration. Being able to space walk without an exosuit was a critical one. But it still did not prevent one from getting shot at or blown up by a missile. Kyle internally fumed as he recalled how he died. Having such a skill would not have saved him in that scenario at all.</p><p><em>Next.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Arcian</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Remnants of a fallen alien race, torn by civil war.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Unable to fully convert to Arcian: Human Variant will be generated instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>So far, every race shown to Kyle had been a human variant or humanoid of sorts, so he did not expect himself to be able to transform into a tentacle monster or something. He did not want to lose his human features as well, as it may cause issues with him back in society.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Skill</strong>: Arcia Reinforcement (Advanced)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>The power of the planet flows through you.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Passive Skill. Ability to use ambient or internal arcia energy to strengthen muscles and improve arcia energy capacity and handling over-time. Unique Title will be applied for each stage of training and time. Requires immense amount of arcite ore to reach final stage. Performance reduced in non-arcia infused environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Passive Skill. All skills cooldown reduced by 50% permanently. Non-upgradable. Overwrites all other cooldown modification skills.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The skills were frankly downright amazing. Kyle found it hard to argue against the usefulness and efficiency of the stats and effects. However, all of this came with one caveat if he really chose this race, a question he couldn't ignore: <em>Am I willing to be non-human.</em></p><p>The very thought caused him to shudder. Changing to any of these human variants may make it hard for him to change back. Kyle had seen a lot of variants back in his day, but it was always the baseline humans who had the highest adaptability, able to work with anything. Taking the 229-A-X package wouldn't diminish his ability to use arcia in anyway, and there was also a terrible side effect of converting to Arcian. <em>Performance reduced in non-arcia infused environment… That means space. Also means that if I ever get on a starship, I would have to bring along arcite ore.</em></p><p>That was a no-go for him. Kyle hated relying on things or being dependent on others outside of his own body. This planet was not the only stage in the ladder he had to climb, and the places he intended to reach were not all laden with arcite either. He couldn't imagine lugging around tonnes of arcite ore to simply fuel his psuedo-transcendent skills, it would reduce his maneuverability and increase his weakness tremendously.</p><p><em>Last one.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race</strong>: Dryad-Human Variant</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Stats Increment Per Level Boost: +5 CHA, +5 INT, +5 VIT.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle simply swiped the final race away, not even bothering to look at the skills. <em>229-A-X it is.</em> Without any more hesitation, he selected the very first option he had been given, the chamber suddenly roaring to life as the table strapped his arms down along with his legs, restraining his movements. From beneath the table, countless needles begin to insert into his skin forcibly.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>System Message</strong>: Lack of Anesthesia</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Warning - No Pain Relief Substitute Found. Please Prepare Yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth, concentrating all of his mental fortitude as the needles jabbed deeper, as though he was lying on a bed of nails. Clenching his fists and eyes as tight as he could, he felt the liquid surge into his veins, his bone structure and muscles changing and twisting in real time as the 229-A-X genetic package was installed into him forcibly. Hot lava ran through his veins, searing every nerve and every sensory Kyle had, the pain wracking through his entire body as he began to flail wildly on instinct to the tremendous pain. Unlike the other upgrades, Kyle forced himself to withstand the horrendous torture, his mind struggling to stay firm as the level of pain began to build up.</p><p>Every cell, every pore, and every inch of his body cried out for rest as Kyle's vision began to fade, though this time he held on longer than usual. &quot;GRAAAAAAHHHH!&quot; Kyle let out a roar, fighting to stay awake before a new needle the size of a pen jabbed right into his neck, the sharp jolting pain the final kicker to finally knock him out cold.</p><p><strong>Chapter 119 - Rebirth</strong></p><p>Kyle did not know how to explain the feeling when he woke up, not without an emotive sensory transfer machine. It was as if his former body had been made of lead, and that there were countless useless cells idling in every fiber of his muscles. He had a hard time getting used to the sluggishness of Alvin's body, especially when he had a 229-C-X package in his previous life.</p><p>Now, the sensation was nothing short of a miracle, going even further beyond the genetic package he had. His senses were all heightened, as though every cell and every pore on his skin could be focused on. His eyesight was far sharper now, and he was able to see the entire vault beyond the current genetic modification chamber clearly. He could even read some of the small text on a crate twenty meters away.</p><p>As he flexed his fingers, he could feel the tendons and muscles of his forearm wrapping around the bone tightly, as firm and tense as ever, with potential strength and power lurking within every fiber of his being. He clenched his fist tight, his muscles glistening with sweat and slightly enlarged from what he had before.</p><p>The restraints were unlatched, releasing his wrists and legs and allowing him to sit upright, his entire back pockmarked with injection holes from the back of his head all the way to the bottom of his leg. Kyle's entire body felt new and refreshed, a complete overhaul, as he could feel the agility beneath his skin yearning to be tested.</p><p>He glanced at a reflection of himself in the glass walls of the chamber, his hair turning blacker with still a tinge of auburn left behind, while most blemishes from his skin and face were removed, only leaving a few tiny unnoticeable blackheads and scars from Alvin's prior acne issue. The jawbone and facial structure had been slightly adjusted as well, Kyle slowly regaining his former dazzling features from his past life. <em>In fact, I'll say I'm even better looking now.</em></p><p>Even as he stepped off the table, his feet touching the cold ground of the chamber gave him chills, and his skin sensory details dialed up to 11. Every gust and breath of air could be felt intimately, his mind immediately ascertaining the direction of airflow and sources of pungent stenches, if anything.</p><p>It was at this moment Kyle noticed that the table he had laid on was completely drenched in blood, his body having lost copious amounts during the surgery. Thankfully, the chamber also replaced his blood, and over time, the 229-A-X package would enhance his blood's oxygen delivery efficiency as well as density.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Race Obtained</strong>: Genetic Package 229-A-X Galactic Human</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle stretched his limbs before stepping out of the chamber, his back still soaked in dried blood. The state of the blood told him that at least more than a day had passed, and the lack of Soren's screeching also asserted his assumption. He moved up to a nearby water tank, collecting some of it and giving it a sniff to make sure it was still okay before using it to clean his back off. <em>How long have I been knocked out anyway?</em></p><p>None of the panels on the chamber featured a clock anywhere, and those that did only had zeros filling up their epoch timestamp, making them completely useless to Kyle. <em>I'll find out when I get out.</em></p><p>Soon, Kyle was fully dressed once more, though his shirt and pants failed to hide his chiseled body, his abs and muscles worthy to be immortalized as a statue. Deep down, Kyle was elated at having far surpassed his former life's genetic limitations, but already, the logician inside of him was tempering his excitement. <em>If such a genetic package is obtainable just by me being a System User, what does that mean for the Wardens?</em></p><p>From having observed Soren's wound healing rate, he was confident that Soren too had a genetic package, though it was unclear as to whether it was the exact same as his. <em>Definitely not an A-class package.</em> Still, even though human A-class states constituted a mere 10% of the Galactic Era population, there were still two decillion humans among them, though they were mostly concentrated near the galactic center. That itself does not include the S-class states, which had nearly one decillion humans. If Kyle had truly been transported to the future, then that population figure must have risen tremendously.</p><p>For now, Kyle knew the 229-A-X was enough to put him leagues above the average human, and certainly more than enough to destroy anyone on Soren's level. He did not even have to use the Arcia Mystic's subclass ability during the fight, having held it as a final trump card. <em>Now, I'm stronger than ever.</em></p><p>His stomach rumbled with an aching hunger that he had never felt before, reminding him of the requirements of the body. <em>Right, if I don't eat, I'll starve faster than a regular human.</em> Energy did not come from nowhere, and Kyle needed nutrition to keep up his peak performance. He scoured the vault for the rations that were coated in dust and soot, centuries old at this point.</p><p>Ge settled for a few nutri-paste packets, highly condensed superfood Galactic Era rations aimed for maximum calories as well as vitamins, providing every chemical necessary for the human body to keep functioning. He gulped them down, the paste having no flavors at all and laced with countless preservatives, which was the sole reason they had lasted this long. It was hardly tasty or delicious, but Kyle wasn't picky with his food. He drank from the water tank as well, sitting down for a few minutes to eat carefully and regain his strength.</p><p>With his hunger and thirst satisfied as well as the race upgrade now done, Kyle turned his attention to the pods nearby. He had inadvertently killed the inhabitant of one cryopod, and it had given him more EXP in a single kill than ever before. <em>Should I eradicate all the pod inhabitants?</em> It was alluring, having more than fifty pods in a row lined up here at the vault. Killing all of them would net him enough EXP to potentially reach the next upgrade.</p><p>However, Kyle saw that as a short-sighted action. The inhabitants of the pods were more useful than just EXP - they represented potential knowledge of the inner workings of the planet he was on, as well as the ruins. If he could even reawaken one of them successfully, it would be a big step in figuring out how he came to Raktor. <em>EXP can be farmed in the dungeon. And with the war starting soon, I gather that there would be no shortage of fights for me.</em></p><p>He finally decided that it would be too risky to wake up the inhabitants of the pods now and decided to save it for a later date when he had the proper tools and technology to thaw them carefully. <em>We'll need refrigeration and sealed chambers to allow the inhabitant to slowly acclimatize. It would be essentially a manual defrosting since the automatic one clearly failed.</em></p><p>Kyle gathered all of his equipment and gear, loading out his outfit once more before leaving the vault properly, not forgetting to lock it behind him and keeping the key safely. As he left the vault, he noticed Soren languishing on the floor, clearly famished and dehydrated, and his eyes lolled about aimlessly. <em>Right, forgot about him.</em></p><p>He re-entered the vault and grabbed a few of the century-old rations, as well as a water tank, easily hauling it over with just one hand. Even when Kyle disabled the laser fence, Soren basically did not have any energy to move. With his System disabled, his genetically modified body's metabolism did not drop, only continuing to cannibalize his own stored fat from within, the bones clearly visible on his degrading taut skin. He could only stare helplessly as Kyle placed two water tanks and enough rations to last a few weeks.</p><p>&quot;Try not to die.&quot; Kyle slapped Soren awake, making Soren finally aware that food and water were available. Instead of lunging at Kyle in an attempt to escape, he reached for the rations, greedily opening a ready-made nutri-paste packet and devouring it. Kyle reactivated the laser fence, finally leaving the prison cell proper and locking all the doors, making sure Soren couldn't get out.</p><p>As he exited the small cave and returned back to the Rotten Chamber, a few minutes of travel towards the encampment showed him that the Ghosts had left long ago, led by both Sasha and Feldon away to Desham. There did not seem to be any sign of Nest entering the chamber, and he didn't see any tracks either. The arctech lantern posts around the encampment were all still lit up, making Kyle confident that he had only been knocked out for less than three days as that was their maximum duration with the amount of arcite ore inserted. <em>I should make a move… what’s that?</em></p><p>Kyle noticed Soren’s lightning sword lodged into a pillar of trash. <em>I thought I crushed both of them. </em>Still, Kyle gingerly reached forward to grab the hilt, preparing to react in the event of any sudden backlash. </p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Thunder Blade (Advanced)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>I’ll keep this with me for now. </em>Kyle twirled it in his hand, before stuffing it along his belt. With no idea how much time had passed, Kyle followed the map in his head, making it to the exit tunnel towards Desham, where they had opened the door. The tunnel was already well-lit by the various arctech lanterns placed by the scouts and Ghosts that he had dispatched beforehand, and all of them were still functioning well. It wasn't long before he reached the ladder that led up to the hidden hideout on the third layer, one that Kyle had established as a backup when he had first explored this tunnel. But instead of climbing up, he continued on forward, following the trail of lantern posts that went further and further into the tunnel.</p><p>Unlike before, Kyle's body was lighter and far more enduring, able to keep up a steady jog that was slowly turning into a marathon. With the lack of daylight, it was impossible for Kyle to keep track of the passage of time, though he kept an internal counter as close to sixty beats per minute as possible. He ran for what he thought was two hours, the tunnel slowly sloping upwards as it got closer and closer to the surface before finally reaching the very end of the tunnel exit, the daylight from aboveground streaming through the eroding vines and flora that covered the rocky walls.</p><p>Kyle's ears perked up, carefully listening out for any movements around while he cautiously stepped forward, out into the daylight that blinded him slightly, his eyes squinted as his vision acclimatized. While he knew Sasha must have cleared the path before him, there was always the off-chance that Nest had discovered the existence of the tunnel and laid a trap for him. [Sasha, do you read?]</p><p>No reply came back, Kyle gathering that Sasha must be out of range. <em>Desham is still a way ahead on foot.</em> He had the map of Versia memorized, as well as the evacuation route. Finding his way to the city was easy, but he still remained vigilant and wary.</p><p>The tunnel's exit came out in a forest much like the one that had been chopped down around Ocra, although the trees and plants were far larger than expected as if they were meant for giants. The trees towered more than twenty stories high; Kyle was not even able to see the top of the trees from its base while large ferns and mushrooms dominated the undergrowth, bushes and shrubs growing even higher than him. It was as though he was but an ant amidst the nature here. <em>So this is the Keru Forest.</em></p><p>Kyle navigated using his memory of the route, recalling the instructions the scouts had given to him. It was one thing to see it from the bird's eye view but another thing to walk among the gigantic trees. He even gave pause when he saw large dark blue beetles the size of a football and trident horns one-foot long skittering across the trunk of a tree, gnawing away on the parasitic ferns and fungi that had taken root on the bark. The wind that rushed through the forest barely swayed any of the gigantic trees, their roots anchoring them like statues that were nearly impossible to topple. Some parts of the ground had large footprints that seemed to follow a migratory herd pattern of grazing, bushes, and shrubs having been chewed out completely. Broken branches crushed under the steps that created the same footprint, as well as humongous mud tracks, all showed the presence of equally gigantic animals within the Keru Forest.</p><p>Still, despite the overgrowing fauna, Kyle could clearly see some trails and marks of human presence. One of the red trees he passed had a Ghost mark on it, a simple small knife slash near its base to indicate a trail point. Confident he was on the right track, Kyle continued on, though his irritation at the larger shrubs and thorny flowers hooking onto his shirt and pants began to climb quickly.</p><p>It took another hour of trekking before he finally reached something close to civilization, though it was just a simple path that ran alongside the outskirts of the Keru forest, its surface hardened mud. Kyle moved along the path, walking for yet another hour along the winding path before it finally diverted off into rolling fields of grass and flowers as well as large acres of farmland, joining into a major gravel path road that connected Ocra and Desham.</p><p>To his surprise, the major road itself was already packed, countless convoys and shambling feet dominating the grassy plains and farms on both sides. None of the farms along the major road had any crops growing, all of them seemingly harvested as hundreds upon hundreds of refugees limped and marched, many barefoot on the scorching surface with faces devoid of emotion. Children crying and mothers weeping filled the air, the procession a throng of depression that seemingly had no end. Families carried prized possessions, while the more well-to-do ones were shoving refugees aside, forcing the others out of the way to allow their arctech wagons through.</p><p>Kyle blended it easily, his outfit already disheveled from trekking in the Keru Forest. However, he walked a bit faster, overtaking a few refugees and moving quicker than the crowd. Soon, Desham came into view on the horizon, though its walls and fortifications were far less impressive compared to that of Tenar and Ocra.</p><p>Reaching the outskirts of Desham, the slums of the refugee camps were already visible, billowing clouds of black smoke from burning wood drifting into the air like a plague across the once-green farmland. The refugee camps here were far larger than they had been at Ocra, many having chosen to come here instead of risking their lives and safety near the border of a potential conflict. However, unlike the stern military control of Ocra, there did not seem to be anyone controlling nor admitting refugees into the camp itself, the security has devolved into a free-for-all. No fences, no distribution center, and no administration seemed to be in place for the refugees.</p><p>&quot;Don't you dare sign up for the Versian Army, you hear me! You're going to stay right here!&quot; A mother berated her young son as they squabbled outside a slum shelter, Kyle overhearing the conversation. Both of them were clearly fatigued and starving, their cheeks gaunt and their skin taut, though it was the norm around these parts.</p><p>The son shrugged his mother's arm off his shoulders, complaining. &quot;But we have nothing to eat! The rations are dwindling, and if I join up as a recruit, I can bring you along to Ocra to stay at the military quar-&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are not going back to Ocra! Not when there's war on the horizon! It would be far better if you just worked for Harrison Industries here!&quot; The mother shouted back. Kyle didn't listen to the rest of the argument, only watching as a convoy of wagons filled to the brim with refugees who had signed on being carted off towards Ocra, joining up as recruits.</p><p><em>So there seems to be a rationing issue here as well, as well as at Harrison Industries. Interesting...</em> Kyle glanced around the vicinity of Desham, noticing that it was mostly farmland, though all of the crops were gone. His keen eyesight spotted some of the refugees still digging through the soil of the empty farmlands, hoping to find something to eat, be it insect or seed. Many dying refugees lay along the haphazard streets of the sprawling slums, some trying to mix flour with sewage water before eating it whole, suffering from dysentery that was spreading like wildfire.</p><p>All of this suffering made the outskirts of Desham depressing and a terrible sight. Anyone who had a heart would have seen it and wept. Instead, a sinister smile was already growing on Kyle's face, even as refugees around his path writhed and begged others for help. <em>I was right to set this as the evacuation point. This is the perfect staging ground for a rebel movement.</em></p><p>Near the formal entrance to Desham was a simple gate, the walls of the city not as tall as that of Tenar and Ocra but sturdy enough to hold back the tide of refugees that were clamoring to enter. Guards forcibly shoved back starving refugees from climbing the makeshift palisades and barricades that served as a forward defense layer before the metal-grilled gate itself.</p><p>A mother carrying a crying baby squeezed her way to the front of the jostling crowd, pleading with the guards. &quot;Please, sir, the rations being given are not enough! I need one more for my baby!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rules are rules! One sack of potatoes per family!&quot; One of the guards was unsympathetic, barely giving her a cursory glance.</p><p>&quot;Sir, please, I have six kids and two parents to feed! One sack is far from enough to last us the day!&quot; The mother stepped forward, trying to get past the barricade, but a guard wielded his rifle, jabbing her in the forehead with the butt.</p><p>&quot;Get back in line, bitch, or I'll shoot you - and that goes for the rest of you! If you're here to sign up as a recruit or a worker for the factories, queue up. Otherwise, wait until dawn tomorrow for your damn rations!&quot;</p><p>One of the other refugees helped the mother up, shouting back at the violent guard: &quot;Hey! We're Versians too! We deserve the right to be fed! And the damn water supply in the camp is brok-&quot;</p><p>Instead of replying, the guard simply raised his rifle, aiming straight for the man and firing instantly. The pellet caused the man's brain to splatter onto the stunned crowd of refugees, his mouth still moving while his eyes were locked in confusion as his body toppled over, resting on screaming and shrieking children who began to scatter.</p><p>&quot;I warned you all! This is Desham, not whatever fucking backwater village or town you came from. And if you came from Ocra, feel free to walk back! If you want to stay here, then GET THE FUCK IN LINE, NOW!&quot; The guard roared, the refugees all immediately backing off, the shock and screams spreading through the crowd as the bulk of them began to scamper.</p><p>Kyle himself, too, kept himself out of sight, observing the guards and the resulting chaos at a distance. He peered past the gate itself, noticing that the inside streets were well-cleaned and devoid of any homeless stragglers and whatnot. He didn't plan on entering the city yet, knowing that his rendezvous point was in the refugee camp itself.</p><p>Walking quickly through the maze of alleyways and small gaps between wooden shelters and makeshift tents of sewn-together clothes, he walked up to something equivalent to a small little store, a few other refugees already gathering around while holding valuables and family treasures, preparing to trade them for rations. &quot;Ma'am, please, I need three sacks for my mother! I only have this necklace.&quot; A famished youth barely sixteen years old offered up to the counter, placing a rare golden necklace adorned with emeralds.</p><p>&quot;Three sacks? This necklace is only worth two sacks.&quot; The lady behind the counter rasped her fingers against the shaky wooden counter, her tanned skin barely visible under the scorching glare of daylight as she sat comfortably under the shelter of the store, wearing a purple satin dress that showed a wealth much unlike the other refugees around.</p><p>&quot;Ma'am, this necklace is priceless! It's my family heirloom, and the emeralds are -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are lifted from other refugees. Don't try to play punk with me, Jaden. This isn't your necklace. Your family isn't here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, my family is all of Versia.&quot; Jaden grinned. &quot;Doesn't matter if I'm an orphan or not! And you're going to buy it anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Two sacks.&quot; The lady didn't budge. &quot;Otherwise move, you're holding up the line.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three sacks!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Two sacks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three sacks!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Next.&quot; The lady yawned, motioning with her fingers for Jaden to move away.</p><p>&quot;Grrr... Fine!&quot; Jaden snatched the necklace away from the counter, grumbling as he walked away. The lady smiled as she watched the angry Jaden storm off, before her eyes laid on Kyle watching her from the end of the line. She examined his outfit from head to toe, realization dawning on her as Kyle skipped the queue, angering the other refugees.</p><p>&quot;Hey man, what gives?! I was here-&quot; The queuing refugee's words were caught in his throat the moment Kyle glared at him, a domineering aura falling upon him and almost causing his knees to buckle. The gaze forced him to immediately shrink back into his place and allow Kyle to step forward to the counter.</p><p>&quot;Huh, Sasha didn't give any warning you would be this handsome.&quot; The lady complimented with a suave, alluring voice.</p><p>&quot;Cut the small talk.&quot; Kyle snapped, unwilling to waste time flirting.</p><p>&quot;Straight to business then. Jaden!&quot; The lady called out to the youth, who turned around confusedly. &quot;Two sacks if you man the storefront for me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right away, Miss Diya!&quot; Jaden gave a curt salute, rushing back and taking her spot while she stepped out behind the counter.</p><p>However, before Diya left, she turned around sharply, pointing a finger menacingly at him. &quot;Steal anything and you're going to lose the sack between your legs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That would be great, Miss Diya - I mean, yes I won't lose it - I mean, I won't steal anything!&quot; Jaden fumbled his words, but Diya and Kyle were already walking off.</p><p>Kyle internally judged Diya's disposition as they walked through the slum. <em>She has the right makings to be a proper gang leader. Though she does look a little weak.</em></p><p>&quot;Are you judging me right now?&quot; Diya smiled, her beauty dazzling through her braided hair and purple satin dress that flowed like water. &quot;What do you think?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think you should stop talking and lead me to the hideout. There's work to be done.&quot; Kyle stated clearly.</p><p>&quot;Work to be done? What is there to be done?&quot; Diya laughed as she showed off a few pieces of jewelry that adorned her tanned forearm, the metal glinting under the daylight with a radiance. &quot;I'm doing quite well for myself here. And we're generating enough money to fund the operations of the Ghosts. Culo chose me for my practicality, and I think I'm doing a great job. If it weren't for me, your Ghosts would be starving right now. Either that or picking a fight with the guards.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A short-sighted view. Expected for a frog in a well.&quot; Kyle replied stoically, not bothering to engage the outraged Diya as they approached an unmarked shelter, a Ghost disguised as a refugee already outside keeping guard. The moment the Ghost saw Kyle, he immediately bowed and led the way into the shelter.</p><p>Inside the shelter was a small abandoned space, with nothing but a few stained rugs littered across the floor. The ghost shifted one of the rugs, revealing a trap door. The trap door creaked open, a ladder leading downwards. Kyle hopped in quickly, sliding down the railings and landing at the bottom with a thud.</p><p>The hideout was far smaller than the ones in the catacombs, this one clearly being a simple natural cave. Kyle noticed that there were workers already excavating and placing support beams, trying to widen the living space while temporary beds were made out of empty crates and thin fabrics.</p><p>[Sir!] Sasha shot up from her bed and walked over quickly, examining Kyle's body for injuries. [Did you kill the transcendent?]</p><p>[Not yet. I have him trapped in a cell. Once all this is over, I'll drag him back to the Culdao Peaks for research.]</p><p>Sasha nodded, though there were still a lot of questions in her mind. Kyle noticed it, recalling that Sasha had been privy to most of the words Soren had said out loud during the battle. Sasha's curiosity was made even more pressing when it was clear that Kyle's appearance had changed slightly, the hair color and features all becoming far more attractive.</p><p>&quot;Hey, Sasha, who is the new guy?&quot; An oblivious Feldon munched on a boiled potato, chewing with his mouth open as he walked up with a confident swagger. &quot;A new recruit, huh? Did Diya bring you in? Name's Feldon, I'm kind of the one in charge here. But damn, look at your biceps, was there a hidden gym in this refugee camp or what? I’m kinda ashamed to say this, but you look stunning, like a model carved out of marble…. and your outfit kind of looks familiar…&quot; Feldon used one hand to pat the muscular arms of Kyle, before his gaze finally met that of Kyle's, recognition finally kicking into his brain. &quot;A-a-a-a I-I-I&quot; Feldon stuttered rapidly as he backpedaled frantically.</p><p>&quot;Glad to see you're 'kind of' in charge. Now stop joking around and focus.&quot; Kyle rolled his eyes. &quot;Give me a rundown. How many left?&quot;</p><p>Feldon shook himself out of his surprised stupor, his stern demeanor returning. &quot;Yes sir. Twelve Ghosts left and twenty workers. We got hit hard by that strange man filled with metal, and we lost another few to injuries on the way here - health potions weren't enough for them. Still, we're merging with the local cell group under Diya. That gives us a total of twenty Ghosts.&quot;</p><p>Kyle internally winced when he heard the numbers. He had started off with thirty Ghosts, now having dwindled to a mere dozen of the original. The workers had also been cut in half, dropping from fifty to twenty. Merging with Ghosts under Diya's command helped to bolster the forces a little, but it was a far cry from the two-hundred-strong rebel force he had in Tenar.</p><p>Despite the loss of manpower, he could see that their morale and spirits were still high. When some of them spotted Kyle arriving, word of his survival and apparent victory against the transcendent was spreading like wildfire, permanently enshrining him as a hero to the cause. None of the remaining Ghosts had any doubts in his capabilities any longer, knowing Kyle had what it takes.</p><p>The only ones who didn't share the same sentiment were Diya and the Ghosts under her. She had been previously nominated as the local Ghost leader for Desham but has naturally been replaced by the arrival of Feldon and Sasha. Her infuriated expression clearly showed to Kyle that the merger was not as efficient as Feldon had put it, and he gathered that his arrival was also not to her liking.</p><p>Still, Kyle had no time to worry about the emotions of Diya, continuing to ask questions. &quot;Supplies?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Barely enough potions, and one working arcia etcher. We don't have enough Aspis MK1 armor to gear the local Ghosts, and food is a problem. Even though Diya is helping us source it through black market trading in the refugee camps, there just isn't a stable source of food around the region.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I noticed all the farmlands were not growing anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This, I can explain.&quot; Diya intervened, wanting to prove her usefulness. &quot;The middle-class and richer factory owners in Desham want to monetize the desperation of the refugees. They harvested all the grain and crops in the last month and stored it in a grain storage deep in the walled section of the city next to the garrison. This way, they can use it as leverage to get workers for the factories and their business easily.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The factories are run by Harrison Industries?&quot; Kyle queried.</p><p>&quot;Not all of them, but the majority of them are. Right now, they are producing ration packs to be shipped off to Ocra, which makes it all the more ironic that people are starving right here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That makes it easier for us. With the dissatisfaction of the people in the play, it would be far easier than it was in Tenar to gather support, resources, and manpower. Diya, you are to immediately stop selling food to the other refugees. Food shall only be provided within the Ghosts itself until further notice.&quot;</p><p>Diya squinted her eyes in suspicion, her frustration at Kyle finally reaching a breaking point. &quot;You're asking me to cancel my only current business. The way I even get the rations for you all is by bribing the guards with the jewelry and valuables I earned! If I stop right now, all of you might as well starve to death! I'm starting to think that you brainwashed the Ghosts or something - there's no way you're even capable as a lead-&quot;</p><p>Before she could finish, she found her face grabbed tightly by Kyle's iron grip, the grip lifting her off the ground as her legs tried to kick against Kyle, though her own satin dress restricted the range of her movements. The Ghosts under Diya all shot up instantly, ready to fight at a moment's notice, but Kyle's Ghosts themselves also got up, the tension between the two sides building up.</p><p>&quot;Look at you. Defenseless. Weak. Pitiful. Wearing a dress that prevents you from fighting back. Putting on jewelry and flaunting wealth meaninglessly. Do you feel better that you're richer than the refugees? Is that the limit of your worldview? Is that how your Ghosts think, too? If so, I'm starting to consider you as a liability. I could crush your face and skull in a single instant right this very instant.&quot;</p><p>Diya didn't believe that Kyle would do it, but she suddenly felt his fingers clenching even tighter around her face, squeezing her jawbone and temples until a creaking cracking sound could be heard along her gum. &quot;St-stop! Stop!&quot; Diya pleaded, squeezing the words out through a muffled mouth before Kyle let go, dropping her unceremoniously onto the floor.</p><p>&quot;You have the skills but not the vision to see. You are free to question my orders, but defy them, and you will find out what it is like to cross me. But if you prove your loyalty, I will have you see heights beyond your well. The same goes for your men. From now on, I'm in charge. Understood?&quot; Kyle turned around and headed to the arcia etcher workshop that had already been set up, intending on crafting more explosive rounds for the two railgun snipers.</p><p>Diya gasped for air as she lay on the floor, her satin dress already stained by the dirty ground. She struggled to get up, though she still had doubts about Kyle's plan. &quot;I will close down my business, but how are we to get food? We will have nothing to bribe the guards with, and every farmland around is devoid of produce! Where are you going to get the food?&quot;</p><p>Kyle didn't turn around, preparing to craft the explosive rounds. &quot;Sasha, Feldon, gear up with two other Ghosts. We're going hunting in the Keru Forest.&quot;</p>
