<h1><a id="_21kxiuw4tr9i"></a>Chapter 1: Birth of A New Crime Lord</h1></p><p>Alvin was never one for fighting. Hell, he hated the thought of getting his nose broken or even having a fingernail cracked. Even wooden splinters from wheelbarrows or sparks from arctech wagons frightened him, despite him being nearly twenty-five years old.</p><p>Why, then, was he in the midst of a brutal gang fight in a smog-filled alley lined with pulsating, green pipes?</p><p>Before he could answer that question himself, a straight punch cracked his nose from tip to base, causing blood to spurt and bone to fragment as he staggered backwards, tumbling over broken wooden boxes filled with gooey, grimy trash. He didn’t even know why the two gangs were fighting, only that he had been ordered to come here to help.</p><p>Alvin could barely register his surroundings after the first hit, stumbling about coated in filth from the trash heap. He tried to support himself against the wall that was layered with never-ending pipes, boarded-up windows, and metal doors.</p><p>Unknowingly, he began to wander towards the rival gang, oblivious to the shouts of his friends as he tried to swipe the goo from his face.</p><p>“Who the fuck is this blind idiot?” One of the rival gang members laughed at the stumbling Alvin. He ran his hand over an engraved metal pipe, causing the runes to glow bright yellow before he smashed it right down onto Alvin’s head with a loud <em>thud</em>.</p><p>The runes seemed to imbue additional properties into the metal pipe, the additional force and strength cracking his skull through the dirty auburn hair that became stained with blood and bits of meat. His body plopped onto the ground without a word, dead on the spot. “Fucking hell! Riker killed him!”</p><p>Alvin’s allies grimaced but did not care too much about him dying. All were too preoccupied with keeping themselves alive as they struggled against their opponents. After all, he was just cannon fodder—most of them were too.</p><p>“One down, nine to go, boys!” Riker announced, boosting the morale of the rival gang.</p><p>Alvin’s corpse was kicked to the side, slumping against the wall beside a decaying rat corpse and abandoned junk. Shouting and clangs of metal echoed through the alley as bright runes and blood decorated the walls amid brilliant flashes and streaks.</p><p>“Shit, they got way more arctech gear than we do! Retreat! Leave Alvin’s body behind!” Alvin’s crew beat a hasty retreat, leaving their rivals behind, all of them cheering and heckling the fleeing enemy.</p><p>“You two, check that idiot’s pockets for anything good. Rest of you, head back with me. The Boss will be pleased to hear this. The Seven Snakes are such pushovers, pah,” Riker ordered before spitting on the ground.</p><p>Two of them remained behind, putting on grim faces as they began to scavenge through Alvin’s clothes. They, too, were practically cannon fodder, albeit not as weak as Alvin had been. Such was life in the underbelly of Raktor.</p><p>One of the members served as a watchman in case anyone stumbled upon the bloodied scene. He spotted two patrolling local enforcers about to pass the entrance to the alleyway, but instead of trying to flee, he smirked at them, locking eyes expectantly.</p><p>“Having a good day, sir? Hopefully, nothing to see here?” The gang member had a wide grin on his face as his palm rested on the edge of the metal pipe secured to his belt.</p><p>The law enforcers recognized the gang member by his outfit and  bowed politely as though they were at a ballroom function. “Of course. Nothing to see at all.” Without waiting for a reply, the enforcers continued along their route, quickening their pace.</p><p>“Good. I really didn’t want to pay a visit to your wife again!” The gang member chuckled as he watched them flee. He returned to the other gang member, who was still checking the cadaver for anything valuable.</p><p>“Seems like there’s nothing here…” the other mumbled audibly, sighing to himself.</p><p>“What do we do now? Just leave the body here?” the first asked.</p><p>“Better to sell him off—maybe the alchemist will have a use for it.”</p><p>Suddenly, the corpse jerked violently, its limbs flailing about, scaring the two gang members. “What the hell? Did the fumes get to him or something? Is he a deviant?”</p><p>It eventually stopped thrashing, coming to a complete standstill. The two gang members glanced at each other, hesitant about what to do next. They were hardly trained for a corpse coming back to life, especially in such a violent manner. Nothing particular of the sort came to mind, but in such an environment, violence was usually the best solution.</p><p>“Fuck if I know, but best hit him a few more times!”</p><p>The two men retrieved their bent pipes, with the first taking the lead and swinging down on Alvin. In a blink, his eyes flew wide open, grabbing the first gang member’s wrist with one hand while he kicked out hard against the first’s shins, causing the man to yelp in pain and drop the pipe instinctively.</p><p>As the first fell to the ground, Alvin dodged another hit from the other, flipping his body in a deft martial fashion before recovering into a standing position while still gripping the wrist of the first. He twisted it far beyond human capabilities, making the first gang member scream out loud.</p><p>With a stomp, the arm of the first was cleanly broken, allowing Alvin to retrieve the dropped pipe and quickly fend off the other. Only a single parry was needed to catch the other off guard before Alvin performed a stab to the gut. The stabbing force was like a brick smacking into the other gang member, his body toppling.</p><p>Before he could even hit the ground, Alvin lunged forward in a single fluid motion, grabbing his face and slamming it down into the hard concrete. A sickening crack of bone and a slight squishing sound could be heard as his skull cracked, the concussion knocking him out cold.</p><p>The first gang member watched in horror as Alvin began to turn around and walk back slowly towards him before kneeling down on his broken arm, pinning him. Alvin rested the tip of the pipe on the first’s thigh while he whimpered and struggled to get free, pain wracking his nerves as Alvin pressed harder on the broken.</p><p>“Who hired you to kidnap me? Where’s my exosuit?” Alvin asked the first gang member with a stern expression. “Where’s Xanius? Which star system is this? Where’s the nearest hyperlane?”</p><p>“Wh–What the hell are you ta—ARRRRRGH!” The tip of the enchanted metal pipe pierced his thigh, causing him to let out an agonizing scream before Alvin used the same tip to smack his cheek, ripping off a bit of skin in the process with a copious amount of blood spurting.</p><p>“Answer the questions.”</p><p>The first gang member yelled back as he thrashed about, a reflex from the incredible amount of pain jolting through his body. “I—I don’t know who the fuck Xanius is! What the fuck is an ex-o-suit?”</p><p>Alvin carefully looked at the first gang member’s face for a good twenty seconds before finally releasing him. The man let out a sigh of relief, his eyes still watching Alvin walk back to the other unconscious person.</p><p>Without another word, Alvin stomped on the neck of the other, crushing the windpipe completely.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Bonus free points granted.</p><p>“What…?” The purple box that suddenly appeared in front of Alvin’s face was jarring, and he tried to swipe it out of the way with his hand. What was a hologram doing here? He did not recall installing any invasive interface systems into his nerval jack.</p><p>The first gang member didn’t wait for Alvin to figure out anything; he was already attempting to crawl away, hoping to get somewhere more populated so that someone could save him.</p><p>He grunted as he tried to use his good arm to drag himself away, unable to stand after his shin had been fractured by the earlier kick from Alvin. <em>How did he suddenly become so strong?</em> <em>Wasn’t he cannon fodder like us?! It’s like his body was enhanced!</em></p><p>Before he could move further, a firm grip lifted him by his collar and tossed him back against the wall with a loud thud, causing him to gag as he slumped to the ground once again.</p><p>Alvin crouched next to the remaining member, his amber eyes staring deep into the frightened attacker’s soul. “You and I are going to have a long chat about this place.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>“Shit… Shouldn’t have left those two idiots to it,” Riker grunted as he stomped back to the alleyway where they had just fought. “Fucking fodder can’t even handle a simple task. Pah, I got better things to do than babysit some kids.”</p><p>He reached the entrance of the alley, noticing there was no one there at all. He also noted that Alvin’s body was missing, though there seemed to be clear signs of a second fight—a much bloodier fight.</p><p>That put him on guard, made him wary. <em>Enforcers? No, if it were them, they would be openly crawling all over the place, trying to claim credit for a measly promotion.</em></p><p>His body tensed while he held his pipe at the ready, prepared for battle. His eyes darted about, scanning his surroundings quickly. “I don’t care who the fuck you are. Don’t think you can just mess around on Red Lions turf!” Riker shouted in bravado as he crept into the alleyway.</p><p>A voice wafted in from above in a taunting fashion. “Looks like there’s no shortage of second-rate thugs in this ‘city.’” Riker glanced upwards, only to see a looming shadow dropping towards him from the never-ending pipes. A knee brutally collided into him, splintering his collarbone into fragments.</p><p>He could not even scream. The air was knocked out of him as he collapsed onto the ground, but his battle instincts and adrenaline kicked in, keeping him conscious while he rolled. He bore the brunt of the pain and quickly recovered into a fighting stance, creating some distance between him and the unknown assailant. <em>Who is it? Another gang?!</em></p><p>“You? The idiot? How the—” The sight of his assailant shocked him into silence.</p><p>An eyebrow twitched on Alvin’s face, but he remained expressionless, merely lunging forward with his right arm swinging his metal pipe downwards in a predictable smash.</p><p>Riker smirked and blocked the incoming attack, but it was a feint, with Alvin instead punching with his left arm, nailing him in the guts. The Red Lions gangster doubled over and fell on his butt, grimacing as he tried to regain his stance, but it was far too late.</p><p>Alvin was already on top of him, attacking with the utmost precision, targeting all the major joints with the clear intent to break them. Riker screamed as he suffered a rapid barrage of strikes, unable to move any of his severely bruised and broken limbs. “You. Who the fuck are you?” He roared in an attempt to scare Alvin off. “Don’t you know who<em> </em>I am? The Red Lions will never let you Seven Snakes off, you cocksucker!”</p><p>A swift kick to the jaw caused a snapping sound, rendering Riker unable to talk. Alvin leaned in close, glaring at Riker with bloodshot eyes. “My name is Kyle<em> </em>Hawthorn, Dominator of the Kablsk Spice Routes, Ruler of the Neadrsa Flow, and Crime Lord of the Melsura Star Sector. And <em>you</em> are the first step towards my new empire.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong>Title Obtained</strong>: Former Crime Lord</p>

<p></p><p><h1><a id="_49wwvwoxd8db"></a>Chapter 2: Seven Snakes</h1></p><p>“This was supposed to be an easy fight!” A meaty hand slammed down on the wooden table, causing the map made out of parchment on the table and empty mugs of ale to tremble. The same hand pointed menacingly at a group of young men, who flinched slightly.</p><p>“All you had to do was defend against the Red Lions, and instead, you idiots turned it into an ugly fight that got one of the fodder killed for nothing. We lost control of that entire block!” The owner of the hand berated the group, chiding them for their incompetence.</p><p>“It wasn’t our fault—Riker was too strong! We need more equipment and trai—” one of the guys complained, infuriated at the one-sided scolding.</p><p>“You’re useless, Damian. I could have easily beaten him with one hand tied behind my back if I was there. Back in my heyday, I was a champion in this sector! Me, Ulon Baktar! Even the Ardent Cretins were small fries during our time.” The gang leader of the Seven Snakes smacked his chest with that same meaty hand.</p><p><em>Then why don’t you go there and fight them yourself, huh?</em> Damian internally raged as Ulon Baktar went on a spiel about the good old days and how the Seven Snakes used to be a great gang, controlling more than five districts in the South Sector. Now they were a small-time racket, barely a factor in the criminal underbelly of Raktor. Damian was not even sure they truly controlled the district now, with the Red Lions moving in.</p><p>The only reason why most of the twenty gang members remained behind was that they were far too weak to join the other gangs, as well as being locals of this district right here. Their friends, family, and acquaintances were all here. Leaving the gang meant their relationships would be in jeopardy, which was a form of blackmail used by Ulon. Damian grimaced, shooting a glare at the man. <em>If only I had enough strength to kill him in a duel to become leader instead…</em></p><p>But it was not for lack of trying; Damian had seen braver gang members get killed. Ulon had a unique necklace made out of three green crystals that healed him as well, causing any duel to turn into a battle of attrition. <em>Until I find a way to overcome that necklace…</em></p><p>“Don’t you know how I became the leader? I dueled the previous one as per tradition, winning easily! It is ALL of you, the useless trash, that is dragging down the reputation we once had!” Ulon accused.</p><p>Before Ulon could continue his monologue any further, the door burst wide open, causing everyone in the room to turn their heads immediately. A shocked murmur spread through the group like wildfire, their eyes not believing what they were seeing. <em>What?! Alvin?!</em></p><p><em>Alvin—or rather, </em>Kyle Hawthorn—entered, dragging the badly beaten-up Riker behind him, who was still slightly whimpering as the rough flooring continuously cut into his wounded limbs. Kyle had Riker’s enchanted metal pipe strapped to his belt, his clothes still stained with dried blood.</p><p>Tossing Riker to the side without care, Kyle walked up to face Ulon directly, who was still sitting behind the table in shock. “You are the gang leader of the Seven Snakes?” Kyle asked stoically.</p><p>“Al-Alvin, I heard from Damian that you were badly hurt. They thought you were dead! Where did you find Riker? Was it another gang that intervened? Did we get back the block?” Ulon hardly cared about Alvin’s survival. He was far more happy about seeing one of Red Lions’ goons in terrible shape, focusing on Riker’s bruised face with glee. A victory was hard to come by in the Seven Snakes, even for all of Ulon’s ranting.</p><p>Kyle snapped his fingers in the air, a light but somehow extremely clear and attention-grabbing action. “Answer the question.”</p><p>Ulon was slightly taken aback by the sheer confidence and authority that Alvin now exuded out of nowhere. Instead of replying directly, Ulon was more angered by the fact that this lowly fodder had the audacity to act like he was in charge.</p><p>“Yes, I am your leader, and I order you to get back in line before I punish you again! Seems like the fight has made you forget how things are run around here!” Ulon roared as he stood up, clearly in a furious rage. Kyle, however, did not break his gaze, staring right into Ulon’s eyes.</p><p>“I heard you killed the previous leader in a duel. As per tradition, I challenge you to a duel for the position of gang leader.”</p><p>The entire room was stunned, with some members even rubbing their ears to make sure they weren’t hearing things. Seeing Riker badly injured was one thing, but now the weak Alvin was suddenly standing up to Ulon? Damian couldn’t believe what he was witnessing, attempting to step forward to intervene and save Alvin from a premature death. “Boss, please forgive him. He may be a bit muddled from the fig—”</p><p>Ulon held up a hand, motioning for Damian to shut the fuck up, before he squinted his eyes at Kyle, completely serious. “You do know it’s a life-or-death duel?”</p><p>“Life or death only matters for you.” The arrogant reply and the nonchalant expression on Kyle’s face irked Ulon even more, pushing him over the edge.</p><p>“Good. If you want to be beaten to death so bad, I’ll happily oblige. I won’t be killing off my property so soon, though. I’ll have you taste punishment!”</p><p>“Very well.” Kyle immediately delivered a solid kick in place, smacking the entire table right into Ulon and toppling him over his chair. The impact had the flimsy wooden table splintered in the middle, catching Ulon off guard and slightly disorienting him from the shock.</p><p>Before Ulon could even make a move, Kyle grabbed the enchanted metal pipe from his waist belt, charging right in and smacking it as hard as he could on Ulon’s undefended head. A loud snapping sound was heard, Ulon’s forearm bone shattering in a desperate attempt to block, a solid gash of blood erupting.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Enchanted Metal Pipe (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>However, unlike Riker’s activation of the engraving, Kyle’s pipe did not glow at all, showing no apparent difference from a normal pipe. He couldn’t feel any bonuses or special effects being applied either. It did not matter to Kyle for now; as long as the weapon existed, he could use it. It was all the same to him.</p><p>Instead of crying out, Ulon bore the pain and began to try and fight back while he still lay on the floor, throwing a few punches and kicks, engravings on the three crystals of his unique necklace glowing green. A green aura enveloped Ulon, healing the wound on his forearm like magic and mending it slowly, the healing process of the body accelerated. “Hah, you think you can—”</p><p>Another quick smack on his arm interrupted Ulon, cracking his forearm again, followed by a flurry of rapid hits. Kyle wasn’t about to let Ulon heal, continuously whacking the man, keeping up the barrage. Damian and the other gang members were rooted to the spot, none of them stepping forward to intervene in the duel as they watched a masterclass in unforgiving violence play out right before their eyes.</p><p>“Wai—WAIT! STOP!” Ulon screamed, sticking his other good arm out, which was unceremoniously hit by the enchanted metal pipe too. Kyle whacked with consistency, never stopping and with a constant breath, as though he were pounding dough in a rhythm.</p><p>The beating continued for three minutes without pause, the necklace’s glow beginning to fade. Ulon could barely talk now, his face a complete mess covered in blood and snot, the green aura failing to keep up with the damage inflicted. Kyle finally grabbed the metal pipe with both arms before smashing it right down on Ulon’s head, a soft little spurt echoing through the office.</p><p>None of the other members dared to move even after the duel had ended, shocked by the sheer brutality revealed by Alvin. It was like a different human—no, a monster—had awoken within him.</p><p>Kyle was about to raise his metal pipe to hit Ulon again when an intrusive message in the form of purple “holograms” appeared once again in front of him. He noticed no one else reacted to the appearance. <em>I must be the only one who can see this.</em></p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">[SYSTEM MESSAGE]</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Bonus free points granted.</p><p>Kyle rested his bloodied metal pipe on his shoulders and bent over to rip Ulon’s necklace from his neck, curious about the source of the green aura.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Necklace of Healing (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>Arcia? </em>Kyle did not focus on that right now, instead glancing around at the frightened gang members. “Anyone else want to try me?”</p><p>The gang members shook their heads rapidly, including Damian. While Ulon was a slob and a lazy leader, there was no doubt he was well-defended and had a solid constitution. The number of hits Kyle had to deliver to kill Ulon was a testament to that. Kyle didn’t even look tired, his eyes still staring directly at them with rapt attention, while his pipe still had beads of blood trickling down its length.</p><p>“No, leader.” Damian bowed immediately, a slight fear erupting on his face as he realized that Kyle could maybe beat all of them up without breaking a sweat. <em>If I couldn’t beat Ulon in a duel, I certainly can’t beat Alvin now!</em></p><p>“Good. From now on, the gang is under me. The name shall remain the same. Who’s the oldest gang member here?” Kyle asked.</p><p>Damian and the gang members looked at one another, completely confused about Alvin’s apparent memory loss. <em>Does he really not remember anything about the gang?</em> “I’ve been here the longest, about five years now, Alvin.”</p><p>“Okay. The rest of you dump him into the nutri-recycler or the airlock and get out of this room. Throw that ‘Riker’ guy into the cells. You stay. Also, from now on, my name is Kyle. Got it?” Kyle motioned to the corpse of Ulon and the unconscious Riker with a dismissive tone.</p><p>Expressions of utter confusion were apparent to the gang members. They began to whisper amongst themselves, wondering if Alvin had finally gone senile or had been pushed to the edge by the near-death experience, developing a completely different personality out of nowhere. <em>More importantly, though, what the fuck is a nutri-recycler?</em></p><p>A loud and clear snap rang through the room again. “I said, ‘Got it?’” Kyle stared them down with a stern expression, causing the rest of the gang members to nod their heads vigorously, exiting the room while carrying the dead Ulon and unconscious Riker, leaving Damian alone with his new leader.</p><p>Kyle kicked the broken table apart, retrieved the somehow structurally sound chair, and sat down on it before staring right at Damian. “Name?”</p><p>“Alvin, do you not remember me? What happened to you in that fight? I swear, I didn’t mean to abandon you; it’s just…” Damian rambled before looking up into Kyle’s eyes, seeing that he was extremely serious and not in a joking mood. The blotches of blood that stained Kyle’s hair, clothes, and face only made it more apparent.</p><p>“My name is Damian, Leader,” the man formally replied after a few seconds, to which Kyle finally nodded.</p><p>“I’m going to be asking some questions. You will answer immediately and directly to the best of your abilities.”</p><p>Damian nodded. <em>Did he lose all his memories, and another personality took over?</em></p><p>“Good. I only need to know four things. First, economic factors. What is the current state of the economy? Average debt per person?”</p><p>“Eco-what?” Damian was already lost.</p><p>Kyle took a long, deep breath, slowly exhaling in exasperation. Damian rubbed his hands nervously as he saw a glimpse of irritation cross Kyle’s face.</p><p>“Fine. What is the population of the city?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. The city of Raktor is home to approximately eight million people. We are currently in the South Sector.” <em>He did lose all his memories.</em></p><p>“What is the level of technology here?”</p><p>“Level of technology…? Well, most of the new stuff runs on arctech, machinery, and so on. I’m not sure how to explain it…” Damian scratched his head, completely confused as to what Kyle was asking.</p><p>Kyle frowned visibly, causing Damian to tense up slightly before asking another question. “How does this city make money? Do you have a currency system?”</p><p>“Make money? Alvin, now you’re talking like some strang—” Damian caught himself, aware of Kyle’s increasingly frustrated glare. “Ah yes, the city is a big trade hub, so most of the money comes from trading and services. We’re at the edge of the empire, bordering two other nations. There are a good number of factories in the South Sector, but they are still fairly new and not scaled up yet; mostly research. The currency is rakels.”</p><p>“So a nascent industrialization society…”</p><p>“Na-sce-nt?”</p><p>“Ignore that. How do the Seven Snakes make money now?”</p><p>Damian was familiar with this, having been in the gang for nearly five years. <em>Something Alvin should be familiar with too.</em> “Oh, the usual. We provide protection services to traders and stall owners in this district as well as other shops. We also trade in alcohol and own a few brothels. Or at least we used to.”</p><p>“Alcohol?”</p><p>“Yes, wine; moonshine mostly. There’s a city-wide ban on alcohol and many other things now, so the gangs have been fighting or negotiating for every inch of territory to cash in on potential customers. That was why we were fighting for that area, Alv… Kyl… Leader, sorry.”</p><p>Kyle’s eyes seemed to light up. It seemed that one of his first steps had already been accomplished. “How rich are we now relative to the rest of the city? Top five percent, I assume?”</p><p>“Pe-rc-ent? What’s that? Actually, we’ve been in debt to the Crimson Swords in the East Sector for about three months now,” Damian said with a sheepish smile.</p><p>Kyle’s eyes immediately lost their light, but he was unfazed. There was still a chance.</p><p>“You mentioned arctech—What’s that?”</p><p>“Arctech is equipment that relies on energy, specifically arcia energy that can be found stored in arcite ore.”</p><p>Kyle recalled seeing the term “arcia energy” in the intrusive purple window previously for Ulon’s healing necklace. “Arcite?”</p><p>“A mineral that provides arcia energy, other than living beings like us and leylines. Something that powers weapons like your metal pipe.”</p><p>Kyle checked his still bloodied metal pipe, noticing the runes on it. It did not activate when he was swinging it for some reason.</p><p>“How big is our gang? This can’t be all the members, right? Where are the rest? I was told by a Red Lions member that we control an entire district.”</p><p>Damian was a bit ashamed, seeing Kyle ask it with such confidence. “This is our full strength. Twenty men are all we have. We used to be bigger, but we barely have any money to recruit anymore.”</p><p>Damian watched Kyle grip the metal pipe even harder, causing him to tremble slightly as Kyle’s face seemed to simmer with rage or disappointment.</p><p>Kyle pondered for a moment before realizing something was missing. “Are drugs banned? Psychedelics? Hallucinatory products?” Kyle tried every term he could think of that Damian would register.</p><p>“Ps-ki-eric-ks? Drugs? What? If you’re talking about hallucinations, an engraved arctech array or a potion would be able to inflict illusions. We have alchemists in the city, though such potions are ridiculously overpriced and hard to procure. Only the well-to-do use them on the regular for parties…”</p><p>A small smile appeared on Kyle’s face as he heard the keywords he wanted to hear, which only frightened Damian even more. It was the smile of a businessman who knew they had found a hole in the market.</p><p>“Now we’re getting somewhere.”<a id="_kh5lu0z4z3t1"></a><h1><a id="_9zp71hycx1z"></a>Chapter 3: Carving Out A Market</h1></p><p><em>The next day…</em></p><p>Kyle’s entire body was aching. He had overexerted himself during the fight, and his muscles screamed for rest. He sat in an opulent red velvet chair, the bloodstains from yesterday long gone and replaced with a slightly worn formal suit appropriated from the stash of the gang. Ulon’s humongous suits clearly did not fit him.</p><p>He was in Ulon’s private room, now obviously his. It was filled with useless trinkets, trophies, and a gaudy stuffed head of a wildlife Kyle had never seen before. All extremely distracting and a waste of time, in his opinion.</p><p>It had been slightly more than a day since he arrived in the city of Raktor, somehow waking up in another person’s body, along with a holographic interface reminiscent of VR games.</p><p><em>It’s far too real to be a VR game</em>… Kyle pondered as he checked his face in the mirror, looking nothing like how he had in the past. His face no longer had the perfection of designer genes cultivated over centuries, and his auburn hair was a stark contrast from his previous pristine jet-black hair. Clear blemishes, pimples, and terrible skin all made for what Kyle could only refer to as “mediocre” and hardly attractive. <em>Not an issue now.</em></p><p>The first rule of thumb for Kyle when entering an unknown and potentially hostile environment was to ensure his safety. By instantaneously taking out Ulon, he had temporarily secured his position as a leader of a gang, albeit of a small one but easier to control and tweak to his preference. <em>Twenty weak members are hardly enough to serve as a buffer against enemies…</em></p><p>Efficiency was the name of the game when one wanted to be a galactic crime lord. Kyle did not beat around the bush, immediately coming up with a simple step-by-step plan.<ol><li>Build a solid base or group of people to perform menial labor and reach a position preferably on the same level as his previous titles. Remain hidden from the big powers as much as possible.</li><li>Find a niche market to sell, preferably illegal, so as to exploit profit margins. Scale up and dominate the market, then establish a monopoly and maintain it.</li><li>Figure out how the hell he survived and woke up in another person’s body.</li></ol></p><p><em>There is also the issue of the gang I attacked when I arrived. No doubt, they will come knocking sooner or later. </em>From what he learned, the Red Lions seemed to be a much larger gang, controlling four South Sector districts. He needed to potentially prepare for war.</p><p>To protect himself and his followers, he would need money—and lots of it. And he would need it extremely soon, with the Red Lions poised to pounce if the Seven Snakes showed any more weakness. Until then, he had to remain low. Kyle winced as he tried to move his arms, sore from exhaustion.</p><p>On his neck was the Necklace of Healing, which he still had no idea how to activate. <em>I was not able to activate the pipe as well. Does this mean my body can’t use arctech?</em></p><p>He also had no idea how to access the purple box properly. He tried swiping with his hands, and when that didn’t work, he tried a verbal command. “Holographic Interface. Menu. System. Statistics.”</p><p>As soon as he said the last word, a window appeared before him.</p><p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">* * *</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle tried to focus on activating the necklace, which suddenly did the trick. The same green aura enveloped his body, healing him by a tiny amount. Kyle noticed that it originated directly from the necklace rather than his own body. <em>It seems to be using its own internal energy rather than any arcia energy within me, just like the message said.</em></p><p>It, however, did not do anything to alleviate the exhaustion his muscles felt. Kyle surmised that being tired was not considered health damage and could not be healed. <em>This will be a problem; I will need to learn more about how this holographic statistics interface works.</em></p><p>He inspected the statistics in front of him, his attention drawn to what seemed to be his body’s parameters in terms of strength, dexterity, intelligence, and so on. <em>How do the statistics work?</em></p><p>He noticed that he had a few free points, recalling a message about “Bonus Free Points” being allocated to him, thanks to the level-up. To figure out how the stats worked, he decided to perform a small test.</p><p><em>The easiest one to test now would be strength. </em>Kyle got up from his chair and attempted to lift the bedframe of Ulon’s luxurious bed, his arms straining slightly.</p><p><em>Assuming the statistics scale linearly, let’s increase strength by half. I should then theoretically get a 50 percent boost in strength.</em></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Information</strong></strong>: Free points allocated</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">+20 STR</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He tried to lift the bed frame again, expecting to be able to do it with ease given the linear boost. However, he could still barely move it himself, though he could tell he was struggling less, albeit a tiny bit. <em>Seems like the statistics’ scaling is not linear.</em></p><p>It would be difficult to prove the equation on which the statistics worked without an accurate strength meter. Kyle could not begin to fathom how to even measure intelligence without a Galactic Era Council–approved diagnosis.</p><p>He also noted how simple it was to have free points allocated, with almost no implementation delay to his body. <em>Could be useful in a tight situation—I’ll save the rest for now.</em></p><p>Kyle explored other features of the holographic interface, especially interested in the description of items that he touched. He tried touching a few items around, such as the chair that he was sitting on, hoping to obtain a message. However, no intrusive purple message appeared. Kyle concluded that it did not work on mundane objects.</p><p>He did not know if other humans had the same interface, but given the fact that it displayed every single piece of information—both past and present of the individual—Kyle knew better than to reveal such detail to those around him. Especially when he’d only been the leader for a day. <em>I will not let myself be betrayed again, that is for sure</em>.</p><p>Kyle dragged himself out of the room, assuming the strong and stern posture again, before returning to the main office. A crime lord must always espouse and demonstrate strength, dominance, and competency, even when running a small-time gang.</p><p>The broken table had been replaced with another basic table. Atop was the same parchment with the map of Raktor, the bloodstains of Ulon cleaned up. Damian was already waiting for him in the office.</p><p>“Can you read and write?” Kyle asked as he walked toward the desk and sat down.</p><p>“Uhm, yes, but if you’re looking for dictation writing or proper calculations, my younger brother can do much better than I can.”</p><p>“Fetch him.”</p><p>Damian soon returned with a young kid barely eighteen years old. “He’s Keith.”</p><p>Keith looked up at Damian in utter confusion, silently mouthing to his brother. “<em>Doesn’t Alvin already know me?”</em></p><p>In response, Damian gave him a look that boiled down to “Shut the fuck up and play along.”</p><p>“Good, come here.” Kyle retrieved a large, bulky book from a bookcase, which looked like an account of the gang’s finances. “Read this out loud.”</p><p>Kyle couldn’t read the language of the book but could somehow speak the same language as Damian and the rest. <em>I must find a way to fix this impediment in the future</em>.</p><p>Keith was slightly excited, having not been able to touch the account books under Ulon. He began to read out loud, using his finger to trace the myriad numbers. “This year, Year 369 of the Yual Reign, in the month of Autirth, 42,262 rakels were obtained as revenue. The deficit is…” He hesitated, glancing slightly at Kyle.</p><p>“Continue.” Kyle’s demeanour frightened Keith, spurring him to read on.</p><p>Every month that Keith read out, Kyle’s expression only got darker and darker until he was almost boiling with rage.</p><p>When he had learned about the gang’s power ranking in the sector, he had chosen the smallest gang possible in the vicinity. When starting from scratch, it was wise to never aim for the big guns immediately. Kyle did not think he could directly take on the Red Lions or even the Ardent Cretins, the supposed major gang of the South Sector, alone. Kyle was also not intent on being a subordinate and “climbing the ladder.” He had far better things to do than listen to someone else.</p><p>“Ulon was a great gang leader,” Kyle muttered sarcastically. If he had such a subordinate back in the Melsura Star Sector, he would have instantly executed him by particle irradiance from the nearest star.</p><p>“As of this month, the month of Autirth, the total deficit we owe to the Crimson Swords is approximately 1.2 million rakels, with an expected due date of four months on the last day of Decaber. The end of the year.”</p><p>“So what I’m hearing is that even if we cut all our expenses right now, it will take us around thirty months to come close to repaying the debt, assuming there is no interest. And that is assuming the accounts are accurate.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, though the interest rate is a tenth year on year.” Keith was still slightly stiff.</p><p>Kyle didn’t react anymore. He was already far too incensed to care. Instead of wasting emotions and energy on being outraged, he focused on Keith. “You seem like you are good with finances and accounts.”</p><p>“I used to train under a scholar before we came here… sir. Leader.” Keith still couldn’t get used to calling Kyle sir. The change from the weak Alvin, who always cared for them, to this distant Kyle was too drastic.</p><p>“Good. From now on, you’ll be my assistant with financial issues. Every night, you are to spend one hour teaching me how to read and write as well. Do this, and there will be a reward for you. Now leave us.”</p><p>“But Alvin, you already know how to read and write… I mean, yes, sir! Leader!”</p><p>“Stick to sir.”</p><p>Keith nodded, bowed stiffly, and took his leave. An awkward silence filled the office as Kyle thumbed through the account books while Damian shuffled his feet nervously.</p><p>A few minutes passed before Kyle suddenly spoke up. “Damian, how many alchemists do we have under us?”</p><p>“Huh? None. We never had any alchemists to begin with.”</p><p>“Not a single one within our protection racket or influence?”</p><p>“Hmm…” Damian scratched his chin. “There is one member of the Alchemists’ Guild in our district, but he’s a bit feisty, though. No matter which gang tried to approach him, he always refused to pay the protection fee, even under threats. He lives in his shop, and it is well guarded by traps and his own private mercenaries. Ulon never managed to get him to budge.”</p><p><em>A well-protected alchemist… </em>“Get ready, we’re going to visit him. Bring out the cash reserves.” Kyle stood up, patting his pants before moving to leave. <em>Perhaps we can complete the second objective soon. But we’ll need to do some scouting first.</em></p><p>“What? Now?” Damian was caught off-guard. He had never seen their gang leader be so proactive in his five years as a goon. Ulon usually lounged around and got others to do things for him.</p><p>“If not now, then when? Once we’re bankrupt?” Kyle retorted. “Lead the way.”</p><p>Damian hastily retrieved rakels into a medium-sized coin pouch before the two exited the Seven Snakes’ base, coming out of the basement of a five-story building into a narrow street that was fairly isolated.</p><p>“The alchemist lives near the food market. We regularly buy our meals from there as well,” Damian explained as they walked through the street. Homeless squatters, rubbish heaps, and small workshops painted the landscape, with kids covered in grime laughing and running through the sparsely populated street. The same never-ending pipes and barricaded windows dominated the walls, as rickety wagons rattled up and down the cobblestone road.</p><p>He had already accepted the fact that Kyle was an amnesiac and needed to be taught from scratch. There was also something about the straightforwardness and strength of his new gang leader that drew Damian in—a far cry from the repulsive and irredeemable Ulon. He could not say the same for the rest of the gang members, however.</p><p>A few turns and corners soon had them at a dense food market. Stalls and carts with colorful banners carved with magic peddled their harvest or forage from the nearby forests and monster regions. Arctech wagons hauling goods from beyond the city came in various types. Kyle noticed that many bore different license plates and insignias, no doubt coming in from other countries.</p><p>Kyle looked around and found a few monster parts and limbs that he had never seen before. Some were even selling mealworms as a meal, but Kyle barely flinched when he saw that. <em>I’ve had worse.</em></p><p>He also noticed a few people sitting at the corner cafes with smoking pipes, blue smoke puffing through the air. The aroma was intricate, the smell of blueberries floating through the air. “That’s a popular hobby among the people—smoking Euria Seeds,” Damian explained.</p><p>“Addictive?”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“Is it hard to quit the hobby?”</p><p>“Oh, not at all. I think the body faces a mild resistance after quitting but would return to normalcy fairly fast, within three hours at most?”</p><p>Damian and Kyle navigated through the crowd before finally reaching a standalone two-story house positioned in between two blocky six-story office buildings, making it seem anachronistic. A medium-sized sign hung on top of the entrance, reading “Haui’s Alchemy and Alchemical Products.”</p><p>Another sign, the emblem of the Alchemists’ Guild, hung next to it. Kyle knew from experience that a highly prized industry would naturally have a consortium or cartel around it. <em>No doubt a strong association… He must have quite a backing, then.</em></p><p>The ground around the house was carved with engravings similar to those on Kyle’s metal pipe. The engravings were laid out in a circular fashion, forming a sort of defensive line that could go unnoticed as mere scribblings. Upon closer inspection, the lines of the engraving were hardened with metal to prevent accidental tampering.</p><p>“I assume those are the traps.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, but he won’t use it against new customers. You’ve never visited him before, so we should be okay.”</p><p>Kyle entered the shop without hesitation. It was pretty spacious inside, with a few shelves with potions of all sorts. There were already a few other customers inside—all humans—who were calculating the total for potions they were looking to buy.</p><p>He eyed the other customers, noticing that they were keeping a close eye on him as he walked through the shop. <em>It seems some of them are security—about five to seven well-trained guards.</em></p><p>He glanced at one of the price tags of a greenish-looking potion. “Five thousand rakels… Impressive.” Holding the potion up in his hand, another purple box appeared in front of him.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Health Potion (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Another dark-yellow flask was on a different shelf, Kyle reached out to examine it.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Stamina Potion (Basic)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><em>Six hundred rakels… </em>Kyle glanced around the shop, finding no hints that the alchemist was involved in some mass supply. <em>He is not as rich and powerful as I first thought—he makes money by selling the far more expensive potions on a small scale.</em></p><p>“Best be careful with that, young man. Once broken, it’s considered sold.” A husky voice wafted in from the back of the shop. It belonged to an old man in a purple robe who rested his head on a counter, lazily fiddling with a chisel in his hand and spinning it with his fingers.</p><p>Kyle placed the potion down and walked up to the counter. “Mr. Haui, I presume.” They both sized each other up for a brief moment.</p><p>“Indeed. Any particular potion you’re looking for? Or just browsing? Or perhaps…” Haui’s voice trailed off, a tiny hint of hostility long honed toward shoplifters apparent in his squinting eyes.</p><p>“I am looking for something of a different quality. Something more exquisite and <em>different</em>, if you know what I mean,” Kyle replied with a slight emphasis, much to the confusion of Damian.</p><p>Haui’s eyes showed signs of recognition, but wariness crept in as he stared at Kyle, scrutinizing him and his clothes. “Haven’t seen you around here before. New in town?”</p><p>“You could say that. If your offer interests me, this could be the start of a great business relationship.” Kyle nodded knowingly toward Haui.</p><p>“Hmm…” Haui seemed to be weighing the pros and cons in his head, while Damian still continuously looked back and forth between them. Every hour since Kyle became the gang leader was a complete rollercoaster of emotions for him.</p><p>A minute of silence passed before Haui finally placed the chisel down on the counter. “Follow me.” Haui motioned to a side door that led to a stairwell. <em>An illegal operation. As expected for such a well-defended alchemist.</em></p><p>The trio walked down the stairs, only to enter a basement filled with potions that were clearly not the same as what was displayed in the front. Kyle was not one for stereotypes, but the entire place looked like a stereotypical alchemist lair right out of an Ancient Earth fantasy holofilm. “Take a look. Every aphrodisiac, poison, curse, and illusionary potion I know of is here. I won’t call them the best in Raktor, but I can guarantee they’ll get the job done.”</p><p>Kyle nodded, walking through the shelves and rows upon rows of potions. He noticed a few boxes of herbs stacked in the corner through his peripheral vision, though he continued picking up potions and examining them. Each of the potions was well-labelled and displayed in small quantities.</p><p><em>Assuming he performs all his production in-house, he does not seem to have enough ingredients to engage in mass production just yet. Could it be a restriction by the Alchemists’ Guild? </em>With such a high-value product, it was only natural for a guild or cartel to control the supply and pricing. Kyle himself had worked with other crime lords to artificially control the rate of mining, even though the exotic ore they were selling back then could be found in abundance. <em>All for profits.</em></p><p>He ran his hand through the various flasks, using the holographic interface to inform him about their properties. Kyle still put up an act, acting as though he was oblivious to what the potions could do. As Haui explained certain potions, he continued touching as many flasks as he could, the purple message continuously updating. He only gave each message a cursory glance before moving on to the next while Haui still talked.<em> There is still a chance of earning more, but only if I find evidence of the right potion here. I need a proof of sorts.</em></p><p>He had just touched his hundredth unique potion since he arrived when another purple box appeared in front of him.</p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Potion Inspector (Basic)</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>“Perfect.”<h1><a id="_z76tq3dktp1a"></a>Chapter 4: Reorganization</h1></p><p>“Sir, are those potions really worth it? Mind-bending doesn’t last long, and that’s a bit too many Stamina Potions. Sure, the recovery potions are relatively cheap, but they will be impossible to reverse-engineer as well. Alchemy has always had the highest failure rate in terms of industries. Too much prior knowledge is required to make even a basic potion… sir.”</p><p>Damian was still coming to terms with how much Kyle had spent on the potion, twelve thousand rakels, despite the fact that they were still in debt.</p><p>Kyle did not reply. With the scientific knowledge he had from his former life, distillation would be a cinch. He did not need Damian’s approval for now, either.</p><p>The food market was still just as crowded as when they first arrived, hectic and bustling with activity. The locals seemed to be on lunch break, gossiping about everything under the sun. Kyle took a slower walk, keeping his ears peeled for any rumors—a vital skill in a foreign environment.</p><p>“Did you hear? The Veiled Angels subjugated three gangs in a row in the West Sector!”</p><p>“Wow, so the Violet Devils are neck and neck for domination, aren’t they?”</p><p>“Yeah, they both hold twelve districts each. I feel bad for the gangs trapped in the last six remaining. A bloodbath is going to happen over the next few months, for sure. I only hope the Sanctum of Yual will not intervene this time; it would be even worse.”</p><p><em>Thirty districts in a sector…</em> Kyle was listening intently when Damian slightly tugged his shoulder to the side. “Sir, see those two? Local enforcers of the Sanctum.”</p><p>He pointed to two men nearly covered in white, only the engravings of gold and red on their shirts, pants, and shoes breaking the monotony. They were simply patrolling, checking the stalls of the food market.</p><p>“Sanctum?”</p><p>“The main religion of the Yual Dominion.” Damian sighed internally, now truly believing Kyle was a completely different personality of Alvin. “They enforce the law of the Yual Dominion around here, though the local enforcers usually close one eye to gang activity. They are far too understaffed to make a difference here even if they wanted to, though it would be best if we did not directly clash with them.”</p><p><em>Another significant power to watch out for.</em> Kyle frowned. He had long forgotten the feeling of being a small fish in a big pond. Back in his former life, he had been the most prominent crime lord for a long time, dominating entire clusters of stars. <em>Perhaps that was why I was so easily betrayed at the end…</em></p><p>The two walked back to the gang’s base through the food market.</p><p>As they neared the entrance, Kyle suddenly spun around and faced the other man directly. Damian gulped, the familiar, stern expression on Kyle’s face reminding him how brutal the new gang leader had been against Ulon.</p><p>“Damian, was it? I understand none of the gang members have been formally educated or trained, with the exception of Keith.”</p><p>“Huh? Yes, indeed. We never had the money for that.”</p><p><em>The best underlings are loyal ones who are competent. As of now, they seem to be lacking in both physical and mental training…</em></p><p>Kyle frowned, not replying and re-entering the Seven Snakes base. He had not really paid attention to it the first time he had entered, but now he focused more on the décor, layout, and furnishing.</p><p>“How big is this base?”</p><p>“Sir, we own the entire basement floor of this building. It is only one floor, though—a downsize from our previous five-story building that was lost.”</p><p>“I assume ‘lost because of debt,’” Kyle remarked.</p><p>Damian nodded timidly. Why was he feeling ashamed of how far the gang had fallen? Perhaps it was because he had been singled out as the oldest gang member, making everything seem like it was his fault.</p><p>“Show me around.”</p><p>“Sir, you’ve already seen your office and your—”</p><p>“I meant everywhere else. I want to see the rest of the base.”</p><p>It was unheard of for gang leaders to actually leave the vicinity of their room or office, much less tour the quarters or common areas shared by the members. What if they poisoned him? Backstabbed him?</p><p>Damian glanced at Kyle’s face, who didn’t seem to give a shit. He conceded, bringing him on a tour of the base.</p><p>The base layout was exceedingly simple. The entrance led into a short hallway, immediately splitting off in a T-junction. To the right were the gang leader’s quarters, including the office, personal room, and shower. Left was the rest. A big, bold red sign indicated that clearly.</p><p>Upon turning left, the two entered a large open common area joined to rooms along the side. The common area was filled with junk of all sorts. Heaps of broken metal, twisted wooden frames, and half-crushed pipes were stacked on the corners.</p><p>At the center, the gang members were out in force, playing games with one another on snooker tables the size of a room or training on sandbags and weights in the middle. A stolen arctech speaker playing garbled music echoed against the carpeted floor and dusty walls. The layout was extremely haphazard.</p><p>Most just lazed about on one of the many benches or sofas lying about; some were obviously stolen from an aristocrat’s setting, with the prior fluffy, pink upholstery now a diminished brown-stained disaster.</p><p>Kyle’s eyebrow slightly twitched upon seeing the rampant mess. He was not one to fret about cleanliness, considering he had been regularly covered in blood since day one. However, it was the sheer disarray and lack of organization amongst them that really got to him.</p><p>“Damian. I would like to ask you a simple question.”</p><p>Damian froze, noticing the fearsome expression on Kyle’s face. “Anything, sir.”</p><p>“You’ve been here the longest. Are you invested in making this gang better? ”</p><p>It was a hard question. In hindsight, Damian knew he could have left the gang at any time. There used to be people that he cared for in their group, but five years of continuous fighting and hustling was a long time. Now, he was the last of his generation. Should he jump ship with his younger brother?</p><p>Damian immediately disregarded the thought. He owed it to his former friends to make the gang the best he could. This was the reason why he’d even stayed on when Ulon had been the leader. He was still on the fence about whether Kyle would be a good boss, unable to shake the impression of the formerly weak Alvin.</p><p>“Yes, sir. I am.” Damian resolved himself, answering truthfully.</p><p>“Good. From now on, you are in charge of discipline and training.”</p><p>“Discipline? What?”</p><p>“Let me provide an example. Gather everyone here.”</p><p>Damian began to gather everyone while Kyle waited patiently, standing near the entrance of the common area. It took close to ten minutes for all twenty gang members to assemble, and even then, they were standing in a disorderly manner, yawning and scratching in unthinkable places. Only Damian and Keith stood tall.</p><p>“It’s the second day since I took over,” Kyle began, his face stern, hands clasped behind his back. “I’ve noticed a clear lack of discipline, organization, and training amongst you. You two, run to the other end of the common area, touch the wall, and come back.” Kyle pointed to two random gang members.</p><p>Confused, the men looked around, trying to figure out who was being called out before they realized it was them. The request didn’t click in their heads.</p><p>“Huh? Me? Why the hell would I do—”</p><p>“<strong>RUN!</strong>” Kyle bellowed with such force that the two gang members nearly shat themselves. Without further hesitation, they started to run, reminded of the sheer brutality Kyle had inflicted on Ulon just a day ago. The other members were shocked at the volume of Kyle’s shout.</p><p>They ran as fast as they could, touching the wall before coming back, but they began to slow down upon returning, obviously tired from sprinting the distance.</p><p>“How far was that other wall?” Kyle asked Damian, who looked lost as he tried to estimate the answer in his head.</p><p>“About twenty-five meters, sir,” Keith answered quickly.</p><p>“You’re telling me two of our members who are involved in protecting stalls, traders, and our businesses are unable to maintain a sprint for more than twenty-five meters?”</p><p>No one replied, their heads kept low, ashamed by the performance of their comrades. Some even felt they might not have done any better themselves. The returning runners panted and heaved, looking as though they had just finished a marathon.</p><p>One of the braver gang members stood up to Kyle, incensed at the entire thing. “Hey, fuck you, Alvin! You think you’re a bigshot now just because you got a lucky kill on Ulon? We ain’t all pushovers nor dumb—you must have drugged that bitch to hell and back!”</p><p>“Are you crazy? Keep your head down!” his friend urged, but he shrugged it off.</p><p>“Hell no! We really gonna let this weak Alvin fucker just walk all over us like that? Ulon is one, but this fodder? We all know he cheated!” The brave idiot postured, pushing his way past the others to stand in front of Kyle, bravado leaking through.</p><p>Kyle smiled as though he had been expecting this, though he did not make a move.</p><p>The brave gangster grinned. “Look at this, lads. All this weak cunt can do is stand and smile! There’s no way in hell he beat Ulon fairly in a—”</p><p>Before he could continue, Kyle grabbed the man by the face and swept him from under his legs, slamming him hard onto the ground with a loud crash. The man remained motionless, unconscious from the sudden attack. Kyle let out a deep sigh, returning to his original position as though nothing had happened.</p><p>The other members tried their best to avoid looking at their fallen ally, though it was clearly impressed on them that Kyle was even tougher than Ulon had been. No one dared step out against him now.</p><p>“Next, you two. Lift that sofa up and move to that position. Before placing it down, hold it for thirty seconds.”</p><p>The next pair didn’t hesitate this time. They lifted a heavy three-seater sofa, albeit just barely, and dropped it onto the floor within ten seconds.</p><p>Kyle sequentially gave each pair a different physical task in the common area, with the gap between tasks reducing with each passing minute, causing them to exert even more strength. Moving things, sprinting, lifting, and shuttle runs to pick up random pieces of trash. Even Damian and Keith were not spared from the physical tasks.</p><p>The goons were not dumb—they were thoroughly aware that they were being forced to clean up the place. Little by little, they saw the direct result of the work, some even began to joke amongst themselves as they picked up months’ old rubbish.</p><p>After thirty minutes, they were all sweating profusely, their shirts stained at their backs and armpits. Nonetheless, they were not angry at Kyle. Instead, they felt good about the place being clean.</p><p>They stood in a loose group, marveling at the common area transformation from a literal trash heap to a functional space. Even the trash and litter on the floor and the bulky heaps of broken metal were nicely swept to one corner.</p><p>“Holy shit. Have you ever seen the common area look like this before? I didn’t even know it <em>could </em>look like this.” They murmured amongst themselves, admiring the work they’d done. Ulon had never done anything like this before, and suddenly Kyle did not seem like such a bad leader after all. They knew they would have never cleaned up the place if it were not for his orders.</p><p>“Every day.” Kyle suddenly spoke, causing the gang members to turn around and face him.</p><p>“Every day, I will come into the common area. If it does not even look remotely like this, Damian will be held responsible. You will all report to me in this manner, standing in a row every morning at the crack of dawn, understood?”</p><p>“Yes, sir!” After witnessing the fruits of their work, the gang members were much more receptive to Kyle.</p><p>“The structure of membership is now redefined. All of you are associates, except Damian, who will act as both underboss and acting captain from now on. Through the training and vetting process, you will then be inducted as ‘vipers,’ proper high-ranking members. Work hard.”</p><p>Damian’s face glowed brilliantly, knowing how big it was to be declared the underboss, the effective second-in-command. Ulon had never allowed anyone to be the underboss in his entire reign.</p><p>The gang members, now associates, were also excited about receiving training. None of them wanted to remain weak and disheveled like they had been under Ulon, nor be as dumb as the guy who was still out cold near the trash pile. The band of misfits was already making bets on who could become a viper first.</p><p>Kyle beckoned for Damian and Keith to follow him, returning to the office. “Do you understand now?”</p><p>Damian nodded vigorously. “You provided seemingly meaningless orders, but all the small tasks eventually became something great. It instills into them a simple idea: ‘If I listen, good things will happen.’ The membership hierarchy is great as well.”</p><p>“Not as eloquent as I would put it, but yes. All tasks I give will point you toward a greater goal or objective. Moving on, the physical training program shall be done in this manner, with the objective of strengthening their overall physical capabilities first and foremost. Write down what I am about to say.”</p><p>Keith nodded, sitting at Kyle’s desk and scribbling down whatever the man dictated. Some of the words flew way over his head and had to be replaced with something that sounded similar. Soon, the training regimen was completed on parchment.</p><p>Damian took the paper and went over it. His eyes bulged as he continued reading each line. “This… This is madness! No human can exercise this long without assistance! How can we possibly complete this?”</p><p>“With these.” Kyle retrieved a dozen Stamina Potions he had bought in from Haui’s shop, placing them on the table.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Stamina Potion (Basic)</strong></p>

<p></p><p></p><p><em>In the Red Lions’ base…</em></p><p>The Red Lions were much larger than the Seven Snakes. The gang controlled four districts, with more than three hundred men in total.</p><p>Each of the three subordinate districts was controlled and managed by their respective sub-leaders. They were now eyeing the Seven Snakes district, which would be an easy kill, but they weren’t the only enemy facing the Red Lions. Both larger and smaller gangs were trying to test them with small skirmishes.</p><p>No gang wanted a full-on bloodbath between them—they were there to make money, not to be mass murderers.</p><p>At this very moment, the sub-leader of the adjacent district to the Seven Snakes was training hard against a wooden dummy in a massive training yard nestled between buildings. Winding up a punch that caused the reddish armor set to elicit striking neon-blue lines reminiscent of arcite fuel, he delivered a devastating strike, cracking the wooden dummy figure into half.</p><p>Two Red Lions associates ran up to him, getting down on one knee while waiting for the sub-leader to acknowledge their presence. Panting, he grabbed a towel from a servant and wiped off the sweat on his scarred forehead. He ran his other hand through his spiky, dark-red hair before tossing the towel back and fixing his gaze on the two underlings. “Speak.”</p><p>“Boss Wrent, we still can’t find any trace of Riker. We suspect one of our rivals has imprisoned him.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>The associates looked at each other before one gulped and bowed lower. “Boss, we think it’s the Seven Snakes.”</p><p>A bellowing laughter rumbled through the yard. “The Left Paw of the Red Lions?! Ridiculous! That fat slob Ulon and his twenty hooligans could never pull off such a feat.”</p><p>“But Boss, Riker was last seen heading towards their district, where we recently took over ownersh—”</p><p>Wrent raised his hand. “Or maybe a bigger gang is impersonating them and trying to get us to fight one another. I wouldn’t put it past those Ilysian Punks or the Wretches, and it wouldn’t be the first time they did such a thing. Our main headquarters is still at war with them. Focus your search on the punks from Versia.”</p><p>“Yes, Boss. What do we do about the Seven Snakes?”</p><p>Currently, Wrent had more than sixty men under him, three times the number of the Seven Snakes. Nevertheless, a cornered animal was just as dangerous as a wounded one. Wrent was playing the slow game. Any pyrrhic victory would leave him weak and vulnerable to the other sub-leaders and external rival gangs.</p><p><em>If I can subjugate the Seven Snakes while the headquarters and other sub-leaders are busy with the Ilysian Punks and the Wretches, it would be a big boost to my reputation and allow me more of the take.</em></p><p>“Hear my orders. Keep an eye out for any booming businesses of the Seven Snakes. The moment any of them stand out, we’ll target them one by one with persistent harassment, crippling their finances. They're already in debt, which would eventually force them to capitulate without a single loss of life on our side.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p><em>The next day…</em></p><p>Kyle observed intently as he poured out a tenth of the Stamina Potion, mixing it with stored rainwater as the base, representing nine parts. He then swirled the mixture around before pouring it into an empty flask, filling it to the brim.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Diluted Stamina Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Restores a tiny amount of stamina.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Recommended Dosage</strong>: A bottle for an adult human male every hour. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Ingredients: </strong>Poair Leaves, Water, remaining ingredient unknown. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; "><strong><strong>Title Obtained</strong></strong>: Potion Crafter (Basic)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Mixing water with an existing potion might be mind-numbing but still worthy of recognition.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> +5 INT, increased description of potions examined, +5% chance to craft an intermediate potion when using basic materials.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle immediately put down the diluted potion and picked it back up.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Diluted Stamina Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Restores a tiny amount of stamina.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Recommended Dosage</strong>: A bottle for an adult human male every hour. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Poair Leaves, Greis Powder, Water. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>“Finally, the entire list of ingredients is visible to me. The exact recipe might be missing, but it’s a start.” Kyle quickly retrieved the Mind-Bending Potion.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Mind-Bending Potion (Basic)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><em>Sends the user on an illusionary trip fueled by their subconscious, rendering them incapable of normal functions. Lasts up to a day on a full dose. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Recommended Dosage</strong>: Half a bottle for an adult human male every three days. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Poair Leaves, four remaining ingredients unknown. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>The description had barely changed, much to his frustration. “Looks like I don’t have the necessary skills to see such a complicated recipe yet,” Kyle mused to himself, noting a difference in the number of ingredients between the two types of potions.</p><p>He repeated the process of diluting the Stamina Potions, but no new titles, skills, or information appeared. “I’m relying a bit too much on this holographic interface, it seems. A very addictive thing, shall I say. Perhaps when I get back to the Melsura Star Sector, I should buy out as much of the VR game industry as possible…”</p><p>With 120 diluted potions, he ordered Damian and another member to distribute them to the others who were now undergoing a hellish training regimen. Then, he called for Keith.</p><p>As soon as the man entered, Kyle asked, “How much cash reserve do we have?”</p><p>“Um, about twenty thousand rakels since you spent the other half on the potions. That was last month’s revenue.” Keith was much more receptive to Kyle now, as they had witnessed a relative increase in competency of their gang, especially with the increased discipline.</p><p>“What are our current expenses?”</p><p>“Hmm… Food, utilities, equipment maintenance should amount to ten thousand rakels, assuming five hundred for each gang member. This also considers that there would be no future fights with the other gangs.”</p><p>That reminded Kyle that they still had Riker in their custody. <em>If I let him go, the Red Lions will come for us. I can’t afford a fight now. Seeing as they have not approached us yet, there’s no need to stir the pot. Let’s keep it that way.</em></p><p>“Are you familiar with Poair Leaves and Greis Powder?” Kyle asked.</p><p>“Huh? Oh, yeah. They’re pretty basic ingredients. Used a lot for simple bandages and as a spice. It is quite abundant at the food market.”</p><p>Kyle’s eyebrows twitched. He recalled seeing a large number of crates filled with Poair Leaves in the alchemist’s basement. Each crate could probably hold about a thousand kilograms based on his estimates, and judging by the size of the potion, not many needed to be used for each. <em>Very interesting…</em></p><p>“How much are each of the ingredients?”</p><p>“Erm…” Keith tried to recall in his head. “Maybe about twelve hundred for a sack of Poair Leaves, twenty-four hundred for the Greis Powder.”</p><p>“Good. Go buy a sack of each and come back. Try to remain as inconspicuous as possible.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Wait. While you’re out, buy a sack of Euria Seeds.”</p><p>“Raw or crushed, sir? Do you need a smoking pipe as well? It will cost about sixty-seven hundred.”</p><p>“Raw. No, no pipe needed.”</p><p>While Keith was gone, Kyle quickly calculated. <em>Each Stamina Potion was sold to me by Haui for six hundred rakels. Assuming I can nail down the recipe, I can potentially enter a price war with him. However, I’ll have to add something more unique to the concoction…</em></p><p>The sacks arrived, but they were a bit too bulky to be placed in the office. Instead, they were stored in the common area. The associates were currently resting from their training, gulping down their diluted Stamina Potions. It was not super effective, but every little bit helped.</p><p>Some of them watched as Kyle scooped a handful of each into separate, smaller bags before heading into the kitchen. “What the hell is Alvin up to now? I’d like to say that I prefer this personality compared to the one before, but isn’t this change too drastic? Is he a chef now?”</p><p>“Better than the shitty Ulon who just lazed around. I actually feel more productive now. I can somehow see the makings of a great gang.”</p><p>“Man, I joined the gang to fuck around, not get drilled this hard.” One of the associates was still reticent about the entire training program, lolling about on the sofa. However, he still secretly appreciated the clear growth plan set forth, already fantasizing about him becoming a bigshot in the future. He just didn’t want to work that hard for it.</p><p>“Rested enough, associates?” a stern voice suddenly said from behind. “If you have time to chat, you have time to train and get stronger. We haven’t completed the exercises for today. Move!” Damian ordered.</p><p>As the associates continued their training under Damian’s supervision, Kyle was in the kitchen, neatly arranging the ingredients.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Poair Leaves (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A bunch of leaves of an evergreen shrub known as Poair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> A common ingredient in tea to provide relaxation and a base ingredient for many potions. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Not recommended for raw consumption.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Greis Powder (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A powdered form of an uncommon rock found in mountainous regions, it is touted to improve virility and sexual lifestyle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Not for the faint of heart. Do not attempt to snort.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Euria Seeds (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Seeds with extremely mild intoxicating attributes, along with the dense flavour of sweet acidic fruits.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Extremely hard to crack with human teeth.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>Kyle grabbed a seed, looking around the kitchen to find anything to crush it with. However, the kitchen was extremely barebones, only having the basic utensils. In fact, it looked like they barely cooked at all. Kyle now understood why they had been buying food from the food market.</p><p>None of the gang members knew how to cook, and the gang didn’t have the money to hire a chef.</p><p>Instead of getting upset, he focused his efforts on the current task. He placed the seed in a small stone bowl and used the tip of his metal pipe to smash it, being careful not to break the bowl as well. The seed was now flattened, with the oil squeezed out.</p><p>He carefully poured the oil into a flask before holding it up to examine it.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Extracted Euria Seed Oil (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The oil of a Euria Seed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Someone went to town on the seeds for sure.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He crushed a few more seeds before collecting enough to fill a flask. The description didn’t change, prompting him to boil it over a stove.</p><p>A copious amount of blue smoke began to waft out of the kitchen, attracting the attention of the exercising crew. “That’s… a lot of smoke for a Euria pipe. Should we check?”</p><p>“Maybe he runs on Euria fumes?”</p><p>“Idiot, you want to antagonize Alvin when he’s in this state? No fucking way!”</p><p>Kyle waited until nothing was left to boil, with only a honey-colored residue left behind. After the flask had cooled down, he checked it.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Pure Euria Mineral</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The dissolved minerals in Euria Seed Oil.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Can potentially increase addictive properties.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He then used a separate flask to mix the Poair Leaves and the Greis Powder along with water, trying to get the ratio right. Too many leaves, and it was simply tea. Too much powder, and it was more of a sludge. Too much water and nothing at all. Each flask could only hold 250 milliliters, based on his estimate.</p><p>He soon had five flasks going in sequence, boiling them in tandem for different durations. He checked them all, frowning when the holographic interface did not pop up, which meant he had failed.</p><p>However, with the sheer brute force of combination over six hours of trial and error, he finally managed to figure out the recipe. “Fifteen percent of each, the rest water, boiled for three minutes.”</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Stamina Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Restores a tiny amount of stamina.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Recommended Dosage: A bottle for an adult human male every eight hours. Ingredients: Poair Leaves, Greis Powder, Water. Cooldown: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>He hadn’t received another title or skill, but it was good enough. He then dropped a small amount of the residue into the potion.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Addictive Stamina Potion (Basic)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Restores a moderate amount of stamina, along with a moderate temporary high.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Cooldown</strong>: 30 seconds.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>A small smile appeared on Kyle’s face as he read the description. “Our first drug. And so it begins.”<h1><a id="_gkzq0l9z1j4k"></a>Chapter 6: Bring To Market</h1></p><p><em>Five days later…</em></p><p>Six associates were lined up in a spare empty room, with only two long, wooden tables in the middle and at the side, along with chairs. They stared in awe at the equipment on the tables and the crates filled with flasks and portable arctech stoves.</p><p>Kyle had gotten Keith to use the remaining extra cash to buy them, with the one costing the most being the arctech stoves.</p><p>“You. You’re number one. You’ll weigh each of the ingredients before putting them into separate bowls.”</p><p>Two weighing scales were on the table, the counterweight already perfectly calculated. Kyle had gotten Keith to write labels on parchment and glue them onto the weighing scales, indicating which ingredient they were for.</p><p>“Number two.” Kyle motioned to another one. “You’ll take each of the ingredients, put them into the same flask, and fill it up to the brim with water.”</p><p>“Number three. You’ll boil the flasks, for exactly three minutes each.”</p><p>Kyle then moved over to the other table, where there were only Euria Seeds and a few sets of mortars and pestles.</p><p>“Four—grind as many Euria Seeds as you can. Pour the oil out into a flask.”</p><p>“Five—boil the flask as long as possible until you see a dark-yellow residue like this.” Kyle showed an example. “Then, for every other flask the group makes, drop in just a pinch.”</p><p>“Number six. You then pack the normal flasks separately from the ones that have received the Euria Seeds residue. Everybody clear?”</p><p>They all nodded, except for number one, who had his hand raised. “Sir, sorry to ask, but what exactly are we making?”</p><p>“Stamina Potions. A stern reminder—anyone, associates or even vipers, caught drinking the Euria-infused potions will be heavily punished and imprisoned. Understood?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Good. Start now.”</p><p>The operation began, with the associates fumbling about as they got used to handling the equipment. However, they went slow and steady, afraid of being chided by Kyle, who watched over them like a hawk.</p><p>Soon, after ten minutes of repetitive action, the muscle memory began to be engraved into them, making the job faster and more similar to a factory line. Kyle nodded in approval before leaving the room.</p><p>The associates felt a sense of belonging and like they were part of a greater whole. They might have had more passion for the job if they didn’t realize that they were basically performing menial labor, just like factory workers.</p><p>Kyle’s idea of the production line wasn’t exactly unique to them—there were already plenty of factories in the vicinity doing the exact same thing, though they had yet to see one making potions en masse due to tight supply controls by the Alchemist’s Guild. “Wait a minute… Didn’t I join the gang so I wouldn’t have to do this kind of thing?”</p><p>Kyle wasn’t too worried about the recipe leaking; he himself didn’t expect to retain monopoly over such a simple modification to an already existing potion. He assumed there were already thousands of alchemists who could do exactly what he was doing right now; the issue was the Alchemists’ Guild and its apparent laws against mass production.</p><p>He had yet to learn about the exact restrictions, but it was enough for him to try to lower the production cost while evading detection. This alone would be more than enough to cut into the market and begin making some much-needed profits to fuel his other plans.</p><p>Kyle returned to his office to check a list of all businesses owned by Seven Snakes and sort them out by revenue. It wasn’t so much of a list, seeing there were only two external businesses, a pub and a brothel. The brothel was performing very well by relative standards, providing the majority of the revenue.</p><p>He had been learning to read and write from Keith every night for the past few days. As he could already speak the language, reading was fairly easy to pick up, though writing still needed a lot of work.</p><p>He called in Damian. “In three hours’ time, we’ll visit the highest-performing brothel that the Seven Snakes own.”</p><p>“You mean the Lusty Arcian?”</p><p>“Yes. Once the potion production has filled a crate, we’ll bring it with us. Got it?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“One more thing… I want you to give Riker three Euria-infused potions in a single day. Follow the recommended dosage of one every eight hours. After that, don’t give him any more, even if he asks for it.”</p><p>“What? Why are we giving him our product?”</p><p>“Just do it. Make sure to feed him and provide water. I’ll check in four days later.”</p><p>Damian was uncertain about Kyle’s intentions, but agreed instantly, having lost all hope of trying to understand his mind.<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The brothel was very well hidden, as prostitution was illegal in the city. It was nestled on the second floor above a reputable restaurant, but only accessible via a hidden side entrance.</p><p>It was narrow and cramped, the violet carpet in the hallways stained with bodily fluids from years of use. A dense fog of Euria particles constantly hovered just under the arctech bulbs overhead that flickered white against the blue hue.</p><p>Kyle entered through the main entrance, noticing the décor to be highly feminine in every sense of the word; the flowery impression permeated the entire lobby area, while a sensual tune wafted in through the perfumed air.</p><p>“Oh, my dear Damian, did you bring a new customer today? It’s a bit too early for playtime, no?” A toned, muscular man was resting his head on his arm against the countertop, smiling at the two of them. He wore a pink formal shirt with black pants and sported a slick hairstyle.</p><p>Kyle was mildly impressed by how well the man carried himself. “Good afternoon. I’m here to meet Slavin Tudor.”</p><p>“That’s me!” the man said cheerfully before taking a closer look at Kyle. “Hmm… I think I remember seeing you before in the Seven Snakes.”</p><p>“He’s the new gang leader of the Seven Snakes, Kyle…” Damian glanced back at his new leader.</p><p>“Just Kyle is fine.”</p><p>“Oh my… Ulon is dead? Finally! That fat pig deserved it; I never really took a liking to him. So, to what do I owe the pleasure? Perhaps you have come to sample some of our products? They aren’t ready yet, but I can call in a few of them as a special gift to our new leader.”</p><p>“I’m here to observe the operations if possible and discuss future plans regarding finances. You two”—Kyle motioned to the other two gang members outside who were carrying a few bags of potions—“leave them here and return.”</p><p>Slavin watched intently at their reactions as Kyle ordered them around. “Glimpses of leadership qualities—something Ulon clearly didn’t have. Am I about to see the rise of a new shining star, Damian?”</p><p>“I believe so. I <em>hope </em>so.” Damian nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Hmm… Operations won’t begin for another two hours.” Slavin ran his hand over his beard, gently scratching it.</p><p>“No matter. Let’s go through your finances first.” Kyle pointed at the accounting book behind the counter.</p><p>“Ohh, a business-focused leader! I like you even more now. Sure, go ahead. Seven Snakes own the majority of this place anyway—I just run it.” Slavin retrieved his account book and passed it to Kyle.</p><p>Kyle quickly glanced through the book, his eyes rapidly searching for discrepancies. “I’m seeing that most of the workers here take days off quite frequently?”</p><p>“Everyone in this line of work does. It is fairly exhausting, ya know? Even our customers get tired,” Slavin explained. “We run out of stamina faster, so we have to rotate our workers regularly. You can see this in our expenditures.”</p><p>“Indeed. Which is why I have a special proposition for you.”<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p><p>The nightlife was booming across the district, with hundreds of factory workers trying to relax. Many sat at the various cheap food stalls at the markets, eating voraciously to compensate for the grueling exertion of their jobs.</p><p>Construction workers, wagon drivers, and office workers alike mingled in a mess of people, patronizing every stall in the vicinity. Roadside food stall owners worked tirelessly through the night, frying up meat and vegetables in a never-ending cycle. Some grumbled as they ate at the makeshift tables and chairs propped up along the side of the road, knowing they had a long night shift ahead of them as they slurped on whatever concoctions came out of shady pots, worried about every rakel they spent.</p><p>Even kids were out and about, begging on the streets or doing menial jobs for stall owners in return for a pitiful wage. Other, far more adventurous, kids slunk through the crowds, snatching wallets and purses.</p><p>Drunkards sang and danced their stress and worries away, mingling with the bustling district's ever-growing crowd. Some stumbled home, shoving their way through the crowd. But not everyone made it out of the throng of people unscathed—some disappearing forever.</p><p>Street food was not the only thing on the menu for customers. The reputable restaurant beneath the brothel was booming as well, serving dishes to well-off families who did administrative work or ran farms, fishing trawlers, and forestry companies. Even the enforcers of the Sanctum were having a break, simply enjoying their meals and laughing heartily with one another.</p><p>At the side of the restaurant in the dark alleyway, two men were squabbling right outside an inconspicuous entrance leading to a dodgy stairwell from which a clear cloud of Euria smoke and overpowering perfume wafted.</p><p>“Come on, man. Just follow me! It’s going to be okay!” An older man slapped a younger one on the back.</p><p>“I don’t know… I haven’t done it before, and I don’t know what to do! To be honest, I’m pretty tired after today…”</p><p>“That’s exactly why you got to get it done today, Niko! Let out all that frustration from the job and have at it. Listen, I know the owner of this place, so just trust me, okay?”</p><p>Niko hesitated before nodding slightly. The older man immediately led him up the stairs, entering the brothel.</p><p>“Oh my… Weren’t you just here three days ago?” Slavin smiled at the older man. “Already back for more? Won’t your wife miss you?”</p><p>“Ah, fuck her. She’s probably out screwing around as well. But, err… she’s still in, right?” The older man leaned on the counter, a knowing look plastered on his face.</p><p>“Madison? Of course. In fact, we’ve recently received some additional products, so her schedule will be changed from every three days to every two days now.”</p><p>“Really? That’s fucking amazing!” The older man was extremely excited, but his mood was suddenly dampened. “Don’t think my aging body can keep up with it. I don’t have enough grit or stamina to do it that often…”</p><p>“Ah, for that, we have a special gift for you—and for your newcomer friend as well.” Slavin retrieved two potions from behind the counter.</p><p>“What’s this?” Niko asked curiously, looking at the honey-colored potion. He had never ingested a potion before in his life, the cost always being far above his pay and his family’s means. What kind of factory worker could afford potions on the regular? Even buying one would require approximately a month’s salary for him.</p><p>“Stamina Potions, on the house.”</p><p>“On the house?!” The older man nearly choked on his own tongue when he heard that. “Slavin, you must be rolling in the money now to be able to afford such expensive potions. The price of this would be almost the same as two weeks of my pay at the factory!”</p><p>Slavin laughed it off. “Haha! You are all our dear customers! Why can’t I treat you guys?”</p><p>Niko’s eyes bulged. A potion of this cost for free? It sounded too good to be true, but before he could question it any further, the older man grabbed the potion, popping the cork and immediately downing it.</p><p>Niko could visibly see the strength and vitality return to the old man, a far cry from his usual slack posture on the assembly lines. “Ohhh, that hit the spot! Niko, come on and try it!” the older man urged.</p><p>“Uhh… I don’t know. Maybe I should save it for—”</p><p>“Don’t worry, boy. I’ll give you one more after you’re… <em>satisfied </em>here.” Slavin winked at Niko, who steeled his body. He gave one more hesitant glance at the older man, who nodded vigorously in response.</p><p>“You can trust him. Slavin’s been here for ages! Come on, boy! When have I ever been wrong? Hmm?”</p><p>Niko closed his eyes tightly with trust and drank the potion straight. He could feel the cold liquid rush into his stomach before a hot, surging force raged through his muscles, relieving the aches and pains caused by factory work. Within a short period of time, it felt as though he had just woken up after a restful sleep, ready to start the day anew. “This is awesome!”</p><p>“Ready to go?” Slavin motioned to a book filled with portraits of their female workers. Niko gave a cursory glance at the book before shirking away sheepishly. His reaction did not go unnoticed. “No worries then; I can get you a starter girl that will go easy. Follow me.”</p><p>Slavin led the two to their separate rooms, with girls already waiting inside. Niko was still a bit hesitant, worried about what was about to happen. “Sorry, I’ve never done anything like this before… It’s my first time,” Niko confessed.</p><p>Slavin patted his shoulder with a grin on his face. “Don’t worry, dear boy. You’ll be a regular with us in no time.”</p>
