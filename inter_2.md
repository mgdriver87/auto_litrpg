# Chapter 75 - Sasha's Day Off

"End of the line! Get off!" A loud female voice hollered from the front of the arctech wagon, frightening the dozens of blindfolded and cuffed men packed like sardines.

A rush of fresh mountainous air blasted the interior of the wagon as the doors opened, a stark difference from the usual smog-filled stench that permeate Raktor. The blindfolded men staggered about as they tried to stand, only to be forcibly dragged by others outside the wagon.

One by one, the blindfolds were removed, revealing the blinding rays of sunrise and the staggering peaks of mountains in the midst of a dense forest, cold gusts rustling through the leaves of Euria trees all around them. One of them glanced down at the hand gripping him, noticing that it was a weird shade of green before realizing he was face-to-face with a hobgoblin, its grin ferocious.

All around them were wooden palisades mixed with a few watchtowers, all manned by trained goblin warriors and archers. Their aggressive demeanor frightened the men into submission, though some still tried to fight back against their restraints.

One of the more daring men spoke out in defiance towards the lady disembarking from the wagon, trying to shrug off the hobgoblin holding him back. "But ma'am, where exactly are we? This isn't Raktor!"

"This is what happens to Seven Snakes recruits who don't follow orders. Don't blame me, you chose this yourself. Take them into the caves." The lady gave a knowing smile, the hobgoblins hauling off the screaming recruits into the depths of the tunnels. 

"Welcome to Culdao Peaks, Lady Monica! This is our first time meeting in person, it is always a pleasure to meet a viper!" At the same time, Feldon marched forward, saluting Monica firmly with respect, only to earn a suspicious glare. 

"Cut the Lady and the crap. Where's Merissa? She's the one supposed to keep track of the transfer. Why is it you?"

"Oh, she told me that she's busy today handling other important issues. I'll be in charge for today." Feldon puffed out his chest smugly.

"Is that so...? Last time you were in charge you single-handedly damaged the water pipes. Hopefully that won't happen again."

"Of course, Ma'am Monica, viper!" Feldon saluted again. 

"Alright, enough with the fucking salutes. Make sure those damn recruits get their proper taste of training." Monica groaned, but internally she relished at the authority she commanded, far different from her previous thug self, scampering around with Adrian and Eric.

Feldon nodded. "I'll have them shaped up in a month or two, guaranteed! Lets have the wagon unloaded."

The rest of the wagon's load was made up of household appliances and other tools to improve the standard of living for the goblins living in the first den. "Yes! Finally I get a basin of my own!" Feldon clenched his fist in victory as he sorted through the goods. "And two kegs of beer! YES!"

"Where's the shipment?" Monica glanced around, not noticing any boxes of Euria Seeds or regenerated arcite ore around. 

"We haven't finished organizing them yet, but most of it is ready in the den. Since its your first time here, perhaps you would like to visit the den?"

Monica followed Feldon into the goblin den, still hearing the distant screams of recruits as they were unceremoniously left for dead in the training caves, forced to fight off feral humans and rebel goblins. The den still had plenty of failed tattoo experimental subjects and rebellious prisoners left to use as combat practice. A simple month or two in there would desensitize anyone to the idea of killing. 

The central cavern of the goblin den had been clearly overhauled, with the infrastructure becoming more and more modern. If it were not for the young goblins running about and playing, Monica would have assumed it was an underground human city. Multiple mechanical shafts were attached to small little wooden wheels that skimmed the top of an large underground river, which transferred energy into arcia regenerators that refueled arcite ore.

Elevators and minecarts served as easy transportation throughout the now expanded den, while a myriad of food stalls served fresh produce delivered right from the goblin kingdom, though many of them had a disgusting stench that seemed to only attract goblins. 

"Want to try a Sahusa Radish stew?"

"What the hell is a Sahusa Radish?"

"It's the new plant they are growing real real fast in the goblin kingdom. Like two weeks or so, a bit spicy. It's pretty amazing." Feldon brought here to a stall, pointing out the bland soup that was filled with slices of radish and its murky leaves, nothing else. A few dozen goblins were happily slurping away, chugging the stew down before ordering seconds.

For Monica who had lived her entire life in Raktor, the lack of obvious flavor in the stew disgusted her. "Are you sure it's amazing?"

"Yea! You might puke for the first five bites, but you get used to it after thirty bowls. It's an acquired taste."

"I'll bet. Looks, I got places to be. Where's the shipment?"

"Right here." Feldon motioned at a supply depot, where workers were already loading gurney sacks of arcite ore into wooden crates, with eighteen crates ready to go. 

"Good. By the way, where is Sasha?" Monica glanced around. "I was hoping to meet her properly for once." She had only interacted with her momentarily during the Ilysian Punk War, but not enough to really know her. Monica was slightly intrigued as to the only other female viper in the Seven Snakes, wondering what Sasha was really made of. 

"Oh, she told me that she's busy today handling other important issues."

"Weird, you said the same thing about Merissa."

"Did I? Haha, I guess ladies are always busy. Just like Ma'am Monica right here-" Feldon nervously chuckled, instinctively reaching out to pat Monica on the back before a sharp glare from her stopped him dead in his track.

"Get the ore and seeds loaded up. I'll stay longer next time."

"Of course, Lad- I mean, Monica."

*Strange, what's wrong with him?* Monica wasn't too bothered to find out. Her job was simply to handle transportation, not investigate administrative issues. She returned back to her wagon, immediately setting off back for Raktor down the winding path through the mountainous forest. 

*Now, I should be able to make it back before noon if I hurr- what was that noise?*

Monica immediately halted the wagon, hearing some movement among the crates that had been loaded by the goblins. Grabbing her handgun, she carefully stepped off the driver's seat, heading towards the back where the sound was coming from. "Alright, I don't know who you are, but nobody gets a free ride from me without asking. You got one chance before I start blasting."

Nothing but silence answered her, prompting Monica to board the back and begin searching the crates one for one. Grabbing a crowbar, she pried open the lids of the very first crate, only to find Merissa hiding within, staring back at her in obvious shock. 

An awkward silence passed for a brief moment as they stared at each other, each contemplating what the hell was going on. Before Monica could recover from her surprise, Merissa grabbed the lid back without a word, carefully slinking back into the recesses of the crate while closing the lid, as though nothing had happen.

"You think closing the lid means I don't see you? Get the fuck out of the crate, Merissa!" Monica fumed, wrestling for control of the lid while Merissa dug her fingers into it, clinging on for dear life while leveraging her bodyweight against it. 

Unfortunately, Monica was far stronger than her, eventually lifting Merissa and lid together and tossing her onto the ground. "What the hell are you doing smuggling yourself onto my wagon? Weren't you supposed to be watching over the Culdao Peaks?"

"I'm sick of taking care of the fucking goblins!" Merissa suddenly burst out, throwing a tantrum. "I want to see the city! I want to see the shopping arcade! I want to eat good food! I want to watch light-thrower shows! By the way, this are not my desires. I'm only translating for her."

"Her?" Monica suddenly felt a presence behind her emerge from behind the crates, turning around to face the mute Sasha, seemingly staring at her without any emotions. 

"Sasha says she wants a day off." Merissa began speaking for Sasha.

"Did Kyle approve of that?"

"Sasha says Kyle only acknowledged it, but never really gave a fixed date. Seeing as nothing much is happening and all the rebels have already been caught, it's time for the day off."

"Okay, let me ask Kyle first and -"

"No, no, no! He won't agree to it! We need to do this secretly. It won't matter as long as he doesn't know."

"What if something happens at the Culdao Peaks while you guys are gone?!"

"Feldon can handle it! We trained him for long enough. Plus there's King Sahusa and Gulak too. And if they try anything funny, Sasha and Kyle will beat them back into oblivion." Merissa mimicked a fighter, punching the air with a 'fear-inducing' one-two that had her tire out already.

"Right..." Monica glanced back and forth between Sasha and Merissa, noticing Sasha barely showed any noticeable signs of communication. "Wait, how the hell are you translating her words?"

"It's an acquired skill." Merissa scrambled up to Monica, clinging onto her clothes even as Monica tried to shrug her off. "PLEASE, MONICA! I've spent months in the dens, I want to see the improvements to the Seven Snakes District! I can't keep hearing about it and not seeing it!"

"I can get some men to use a light-capturer-"

"NO! I WANT TO SEE IT! WITH MY OWN EYES!" Merissa motioned towards her two pupils, nearly jabbing into them before flinching.

"Is this your words or Sasha's?!"

"Both!"

Monica hesitated for a moment, before finally relenting. "Fine. But if Kyle finds out about this I'm throwing the both of you right under the wagon."

Merissa immediately scampered past Monica, sitting on the front passenger seat with Sasha, who was surprisingly already there. "No problem, we can handle it." 

Monica's delivery trip was suddenly transformed into a tour of sorts, as Merissa and Sasha stared intently at the village huts and farms beyond the walls of Raktor. "Sasha, you came to Raktor before, haven't you? To save Keith?"

"Sasha says she was there on a mission, so she never really had time to experience the city."

"There isn't much to experience, really. Just a lot of soot and smog, and endless workshops or factories along with poorly maintained roads, not to mention the faulty arctech lights... why the hell are you two getting excited from what I'm saying?! I'm saying bad things!"

For Merissa and Sasha who had been kidnapped from their homes from a young age, they had never spent enough time in a city, so they gazed in awe as the wagon rolled past, intermittent gasps of excitement as they frantically pointed at 'weird' buildings and statues. "Look at the guard towers, they are so tall! The enforcers on them look so tiny from here!" Merissa patted Sasha's shoulder rapidly.

Monica rolled her eyes as they crossed the gates without issue, revealing the full extent of the cramped Raktor roads. They were now in the West Sector, the wagon lurching forward at an excruciatingly slow-pace as Monica tried to navigate past the departure depots, where countless convoys were waiting to depart to other towns and adjacent counties. 

The main street past the entrance gate was a hodgepodge of merchants and traders from all walks of life, searching for the best bargain in the famed city of dreams. Tributaries of the grand river running through the very center of Raktor were filled to the brim with countless sampans and gondolas of various sorts, their goods hailing from far beyond the reach of the Yual Dominion. 

Amdist the bustling throng of people, West Sector enforcers decked out in heavy arctech knight armour towered over the crowd, their engravings glistening under the sunlight as they scanned for any suspicious activities and performed regular checks on each batch of cargo entering or leaving Raktor's borders. The recent revelation that the Ilysian Punks had been smuggling weapons to Versia now had the Sanctum of Yual on high alert, under Count Leon's orders.

Just beyond the crowd, Monica spotted a few skulking children, their necks clearly marked with the insignia of the Violet Demons. They served as the scouts, keeping an eye out as the Violet Demons associates broke open the laced walls of inconspicous crates to retrieve their contraband, illegal herbs and spices grown in other counties. 

Sasha peered out of the murky window of the wagon's cabin, examining the various people walking about and checking their outfit intently. There were a few adventurers and mercenaries decked out in similar armour as she was perfectly functional but leagues below the dainty ladies that sauntered past the wagon. 

Monica noticed her clear fascination with fashion, taking a chance to get to know Sasha better:" If you want a new city outfit, the shopping arcade does have a tailor or tw- yes, yes okay! I'll bring you there after this stop, no need to pat me so violently!" 

The trip continued on, with Monica pointing out the various streets and buildings along the way to her next stop. The wagon came to a halt outside a non-descript building that looked just like any other, with a lone man waiting on the steps. 

As soon as the wagon stopped, the man sprung into action, heading to the back of the wagon and unloading the Euria seeds crates quickly, with Monica helping out. This was the headquarters of one of the shell companies, who helped to lower the price of Euria Seeds across the city. 

Sasha was hardly interested in the distribution in seeds, instead paying her attentions to the various storefronts along the way. Toy shops, artisan cafes and flower shops held her attention the longest, her never seeing such establishments before. Even bookstores were a foreign concept to her, despite having learnt how to read and write. 

They soon reached the shopping arcade, Sasha's mouth dropping at the enormous sight. Mountains were one thing, but she had never seen such a large man-made structure before, especially one that seemed to have elegant curves rather than ugly blocky designs like most of the buildings in the West Sectors. The outer plaza was filled to the brim with workers and residents enjoying their time off, enjoying food and snacks in the warm sun while others queued up for the free public bathhouse, holding wooden baskets filled with their laundry. 

Monica drove them into the supply depot, a basement floor underneath the shopping arcade where the central node of the distribution network was. Drivers regularly came back and forth, shuttling workers and residents around in a designated line while secretly shipping alcohol and Euria-infused potions to smaller thug rackets outside the Seven Snakes district. Merissa carefully examined the various types of potions, having never truly seen the outcome of the countless Euria Seeds that she had been in charge of harvesting. 

"Interested in this?" Monica waved a little glass bottle filled with whiskey as she stowed away her gear and arctech radio into a nearby locker. "Come on, there's a bar nearby."

Despite their original excitement, Sasha suddenly gave a knowing look to Merissa, who's face in turn was in complete shock. "Fuck, I didn't bring any rakels!"

"What? Are you two dumb? Everything is for free - Sasha's a viper! If she doesn't drink free, who does?!" Monica laughed it off, leading them past the throng of drivers and workers unloading the various trucks. The trio headed towards a normal metal door plastered with the sign "EMPLOYEES ONLY", opening only to reveal a rowdy bar filled to the brim of other Seven Snakes members. 

The bar was far from the usual rowdy downtrodden watering holes that Sasha had been forced to clean at the forest fort when she was a slave under Paulie. Instead, arctech lights lined the grooves of the ceiling, giving a ethereal aurora feel to the entire decor. The furniture was flushed with luxurious materials purchased from the best dealers in the South Sector, chairs and barstools well-built and able to withstand the raucous behavior of the associates, workers and residents alike.

As soon as Sasha entered through the door with Monica, some of the associates who were taking time off instantly hushed down, staring at the three ladies who were clearly out of place in the male-dominated bar. Merissa immediately felt embarassed by the simplistic dress that she was wearing, a far cry from the trendy clothes that she had seen on the streets, while Sasha was far more concerned with why they were staring so intently. 

"Ah just ignore them. Virgins who never seen a girl before in their lives." Monica scoffed as she led them through, brushing past a few stunned associate and shoving them violently out of the way. A wave of murmurs erupted through the associates, while the fresher recruits had no clue who the three of them were. 

"Fucking greenhorn, that lady over there in the armour is Sasha, Kyle's left-hand." One of the veteran members slapped the arm of a confused recruit. "Don't fuck with her, or any of them. No idea who the small one is though."

"Left hand? I thought Damian was his right-hand?"

"How the fuck did you even pass the training? Humans have two hands, idiots!"

"Don't know, she doesn't look that strong. A bit fit, sure." One of the more egoistic recruits barely gave a glance at Sasha, immediately dissing her. 

"I'll write that on your headstone when she comes for you."

Sasha didn't mind the whispers spreading around her - actions always speak louder than words, a concept she was physically inclined to. Yet she did not act against the recruits, ignoring them and following Monica to the bar, where Eric Dicar was reading a pamphlet of sorts, sniggering to himself in clear fascinations at its contents. 

"ERIC!" Monica slammed the table forcibly, frightening the nearby recruits to give up their barstools. "Three lemon-flavored soju for the new ladies in town."

"Oh my, bringing new girls for Slavin? Maybe I'll have a go fi-" Eric glanced up, before performing a double-take. He hurriedly stood upright, bowing towards the two ladies. "Uhm, sorry, I mean greetings, Lady Sasha, I'll have your drink for you right away."

While Eric was scrambling in an obvious fluster, Sasha was utterly confused by the reaction, only to be distracted by the upbeat voice of a presenter blaring through a radio near the bar counter.

[In updated news - terror in Kregol as gang violence has reached an all-time high. Word on the street is that a major gang from Raktor is expanding their businesses into neighbouring counties. Count Kreig has requested for intervention from Count Leon, though it yet remains to be seen the outcome of such negotiations, if any.]

"Must be the Ardent Cretins. The rest of the major gangs are too caught up in dealing with each other." Monica remarked as she rummaged about the bar's various empty bottles. 

"Why are the Ardent Cretins so strong?" Merissa asked, she and Sasha slightly oblivious to the power structure within Raktor as former slave girls out in the Culdao Peaks. 

"Don't you know? Their leader, Ares Ulras, is a beast. I heard almost no one can compare to him -  I wouldn't be surprised if he was personally fighting Kregol's gangs to submissions. He and Sebastian rose out from nothing, creating the major gang over the span of three years. When I was young, I recalled the South Sector still had more than fifteen gangs. Now? Less than four remain, not including the Ilysian Punks - and we're one of the four. A miracle by any measure of the word considering our pitiful start." Monica rambled, before pouring a small flask of whiskey out onto a cold shot glass. "Now that the Ardent Cretins are expanding beyond Raktor, it might be time for us to do something similar. Here, give this shot a try."

Before Sasha could grab the shot glass, Merissa clenched Sasha's arm tightly, wagging her finger. "No killing if you get drunk, you hear? If you kill anyone, Kyle is going to find out!"

Sasha rolled her eyes, shrugging off the weak Merissa and downing the glass in one motion. "Hell yes! Finally someone proper to drink with instead of them weak boys." Monica grinned widely, patting Sasha vigorously. 

"Who are you calling weak?" A suave voice wafted in from behind. "Can't be having you talk us Seven Snakes down in front of such beautiful and stunning ladies like these two." The owner of the voice tried to rest his hand on Monica's shoulder, before Monica violently gripped it, nearly crushing the hand. "OW OW OW OKAY OKAY STOP!"

"What the hell are you doing here, Niko? Weren't you supposed to check out Thresher Street and its printing presses?" 

"Got word that two new beautiful ladies were in town, following Monica along. Had to get a glimpse myself."

"Who told you that?"

"I have my sources from certain observers." Niko adjusted his collar and his peaked cap, chewing on a Euria Seed as he shoved the recruit next to Merissa away, sliding in in a slick movement. "Hello, pretty. Name's Niko, Seven Snakes' number one viper. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. If I may have the honor of knowing your name, Mademoiselle?"

While Merissa was slightly irked by the sleaziness of Niko, she couldn't help feeling a little better being talked up this way. 

"Don't answer him." Monica interrupted. "He's still chasing someone else."

"Come on, I already broke up with Emily three weeks ago!" Niko brushed his fringe under the cap. 

"And it was a pretty bad one. Saw you crying your heart out on the ground the other day just outside here. Saying you wanted to get back with her and all that."

"It wasn't bad - It was a mutual agreement, we had our misunderstandings that I'm sure will clear up over time."

"Yea because you were hitting on every pretty lady you saw on the street once u became a viper."

"Allegations that may have some weight. Or it's more than they were astounded by my good looks. Just can't restrain my charisma. Now what say I buy you two a drink or two, hmm? Or maybe three drinks?"

"Forget it, Niko, they are drinking free." Eric returned with the three lemon-flavoured soju, decorated nicely in a cocktail glass with mock umbrellas inside. 

"Drinking free? I didn't know today was ladies night? Well then, how about you two and I scoot over to a cafe just upstairs? They got pretty good ice-cream and cakes that we can enjoy slowly." Niko stood up and was about to put his arms around Merissa and the other, only to find the slightly excited face of Sasha staring back at him, her expression intrigued. 

"Sasha says she wants to try the ice-cream and cakes." Merissa translated.

Niko almost yelped on the spot, flashes of the gruesome mess filled with bloody bits and human limbs that he had to clean up after Sasha's battle with the Ilysian Punks. He hurriedly retracted his arms and immediately took two steps back. "Well, uhh, since it's ladies night, I'll leave the ladies to it, then. Don't need to worry about little old me, haha!"

"Hold on, you said you were going to buy us a drink or three?" Merissa taunted. "I was really looking forward to the three drinks." Sasha nodded in agreement, Niko's face pale as he glanced between them and Eric, trying to look for a way out.

"Come on, Eric, all Vipers drink free, right? I'm a Viper too?" Niko tried to snake his way out.

"Well, theoretically, Merissa isn't a Viper, so she had to pay at some point." Eric tapped the blackboard hung up on the wall behind him, the list of prices. 

"Grrr... FINE!" Niko pulled out a bunch of rakels, sliding them over to Eric. "Get them three of the cheapest beers!"

"I don't want beer, and neither does she!" Merissa retorted, Sasha nodding vigorously in agreement.

"Then what do you want?"

"I want three of the most expensive drinks on that board!"

Soon, Niko's spare change in his wallet was largely empty, Monica and Eric sniggering as Niko left defeated. "Next time better check who you're trying to flirt with first!" Monica hollered after the disappearing figure of Niko. "Dumbass, not even sure why he's a viper. At least he got guts and blind courage. You met him before, haven't you, Sasha?"

Monica expected a reply from Merissa, but instead turned to find two slowly spinning barstools, Sasha and Merissa conspicuously missing along with Eric holding a fake smile. Before Monica could question Eric on their disappearance, a familiar presence was already approaching her from the side.

She immediately stood up and bowed towards the approaching person. "Boss, what are you doing down here?"

"I was in the vicinity, and thought to check up on operations here. I was also planning to inform you of your next task... Were you drinking with someone?" Kyle glanced over Monica's shoulder, looking at the three cocktail glasses still filled up. 

Monica swiveled back, only seeing Eric's nervous expression with a frozen smile on his face. "Huh...? Err yea... I mean no, uhhh.... I was planning on drinking all three!"

"Hmm." Kyle squinted his eyes, looking around the bar. The originally ecstatic atmosphere had simmered down immediately on his arrival, some of the recruits still sipping their beer with their eyes wide open staring at him, glancing back and forth. Only the tense slurps of alcohol could be heard over the music playing from the arctech radio. "Anyway, next task is to distribute these pamphlets around the districts." He pointed towards Eric's pamphlet that was on the counter. 

Monica picked it up, reading the title only. "Are we selling this?"

"No, just drop them off at all the known slum areas. Distribute it for free to anyone. As many districts as you can by today."

"Right, I'll get it done."

Kyle nodded, about to leave before he suddenly turned back, surprising Monica and frightening Eric. "Right, I wanted to also say that there's a few new variety of ice-creams and cakes in the cafe, courtesy of Haui's recent experiments. Perhaps you could invite some of your friends there?"

"But I don't have any friends like that...?" Monica was slightly flabbergasted, but Kyle was already leaving before he even heard the reply. 

"Okay, he's gone. Now, can you two stop hiding under the bar and sipping on the half-drank bottles for free!?" Eric grabbed Merissa by the shoulders and lifted her up, Monica finally realizing what just happened. 

Sasha deftly slid over the bar counter back to her seat, neatly avoiding the cocktail glasses and acting as though nothing had happened, taking a sip. The fruity taste of the drink brightened up her expression immensely, and the drink did not last long as she drank all of it in one shot. Monica had to hastily grab the mock umbrella away from Sasha before she ate it. "It's a prop! Alright, we gotta go now. I got work to do."

As soon as Monica said that, Sasha and Merissa were crestfallen, relcutantly nodding as they prepared to leave the bar. Monica groaned, wondering why she felt like she was raising two daughters. "FINE! We'll get the new ice-cream and cakes, alright? We'll get you a new outfit too, but you only get an hour top!"

Various snack stores were open in the shopping arcade, selling all kinds of wacky food and wondrous invention. Sasha peered at the printed drawing of the new ice-cream, reading the title. "What the hell is a Sour-Faced ice-cream?"

"Fuck if I know, but I'm getting one for each of us." Monica soon returned with three ice-cream cones filled with what seemed to be greenish gloop. 

Despite the unappetizing facade, the smell was tremendously enticing, Sasha hurriedly taking a bite. Her mouth was instantly awash with a stinging sour sensation that drilled into a her jaw, her mouth contorting in tension. 

Monica and Merissa instantly burst out laughing at the sour-face of Sasha. They each took turns making fun of each other, before trying the rest of the cake. The staff member of the store hurriedly scooped as much as he could of every variant, handing them over to the voracious trio. Before he could charge them for anything, the manager immediately stopped him. "If you know what's good for you, don't."

Their shopping trip was brief but vicious, Sasha finally obtaining an clean prim and proper outfit well-suitted for city excursions. Despite her previous fascination with the large skirts that the ladies boasted outside, she found them cumbersome and heavy, instead opting for a simple red sleeved shirt with a high-waisted pants that both looked good and provided for better freedom of movement. Merissa hardly cared about combat, instead grabbing the best looking dress and strapping herself in, wearing countless layers beneath just like the other city girls. "Alright, come on out. Feeling posh enough yet? I've got work to do and it isn't babysitting you all the entire day!" Monica had to urge them out of the clothes shop before they tried on every single outfit in existence.

Happily enjoying the cake and relishing in their newfound outfits, Sasha and Merissa enjoyed the rest of the trip, with Monica delivering the pamphlets all over the city to the slums. Destitute kids immediately scrambled over, expecting some sort of donation or food, only to receive stacks upon stacks of freshly printed pamphlets. 

"Its free for you all. Distribute them, give them away, sell them, I don't care. Make sure it gets around." Monica took off as fast as she arrived, leaving the kids giggling to themselves as they browsed through the various pamphlets. 

Sasha spotted the kids' excitement in the rear-view mirror, wondering what was in the pamphlet. She retrieved a copy from the back of the wagon, reading it intently before she let out an audible gasp and hurriedly packed it back in. Merissa noticed her weird behavior, immediately grabbing the pamphlet and pouring through it, suddenly recoiling in shock. "Eww, what the hell?! Why is Kyle distributing this? Monica, have you actually read this?"

"Isn't it just a random article?" Monica shrugged. "No, I haven't read it."

At the next stop, Merissa stuffed the pamphlet into Monica's hand. "Read it, it's demonizing us!"

Monica relented, flipping through the pages before bursting out into laughter much to the chagrin of Merissa and Sasha. 

"How can you laugh? Why is he entering such a business? We already make more than enough from our existing ventures!" Merissa stomped her foot. "Did Niko put him up to this?"

"What can I say? Our boss really knows how to draw the crowd in."

# Chapter 76 - A Warning

*A week later...*

“This is absolutely outrageous! Let me speak to the Bishop immediately!” A frustrated lady slammed the reception table of the Magda again, her cries overwhelming the din of overworked clerks and enforcers trying to take a break.

“Ma’am, if you would please calm down… I don’t even know what you’re reporting!” Mason groaned as he tried to calm down the lady, motioning for her to take a seat. “At least tell me your name and purpose!”

“Madam Suzanne, and I am here to report of an affront to the very nature of humanity!”

“Huh?” Mason was flabbergasted, until the lady retrieved a rugged looking pamphlet, slapping it on the hardwood table-top.

“Look at this! it is being distributed all over near the Golden Snake Shopping Arcade!”

Mason snatched the paper, it clearly being a sort of published article, albeit one of poor quality. A scantily-dressed woman was plastered on the cover of the soaked pamphlet, the illustration lurid and highly imaginative.

He flipped open the cover, reading the very first page:

[A Warning to Young Boys, Gentlemen and Young Ladies Who are in the South Sector to Visit the Golden Snakes Shopping Arcade.]

*What the hell?*

[It is our earnest desire that nothing dangerous or violent will befall these visitors during their trip to marvel at the shopping arcade, and we also hope that their stay in the district will be both happy, exciting and profitable.]

“Ma’am, I don’t particularly see why this pamphlet is an affront to humanity…”

“Shut it and keep reading!”

[While it is true that the shopping arcade hold many diversions of a benign nature, it is regrettably also true that the district offers a multitude of dangerous amusements that only the most depraved of may willingly encounter. We beseech the innocent visitors that they may be cognizant and aware of exactly where such distractions lurk, and thus we set forth a list of places so as to warn others of their inherent dangers.]

[The Konan Market and Stokes Street. There is no more dreadful sight in all of Raktor and the South Sector than of the scores of painted harlots gathered in these areas. These pitiable ladies ply their awful trade from exactly eleven in the morning near the beauty school until long after midnight has struck, with lodgings for the night often offered in nearby housing complexes for twenty rakels.]

[It is hardly possible to traverse the length of the newly established food market in the Konan Market without being made the unwilling and naïve subject of numerous irresistible propositions of a grossly indecent nature, some willing to conduct their trade right out in the open for indecent sums.]

[This area, inclusive of the Olson Square, is alas, not the only place infested by such girls. The park in the center of the square at exactly two in the afternoon is transformed from a place of harmless family fun and frolicking to a fearsome den of vice and criminal nature.]

[Houses along Stokes Street are but mere facades, places where the presence of a Lusty Arcian employee mark the spots where prostitutes may be encountered with comparative discretion. Other parts of the districts are also habituated by the most loathsome of creatures, some of whom know their hiding dens full of alcohol and gambling games very well, their affiliations well marked by the armour and weaponry they holstered beneath their well-trimmed clothes.]

[Despite the best effort of humbler vigilantes and crusaders such as ourselves of the Crusaders Against Vices, brothels, pubs and casnios abound in all areas of the districts. Take good care of your steps, lest you find yourself enticed to such dens of terrible circumstances, as , for instance, the Seductive Serpent tucked away at a basement on Pullers Lane No 41, open from six in the evening till late where horrid pints of alcohol are served for a mere four rakels each.]

[Such establishments are said to possess courtesans skilled in the arts of Aphrodite who cater to the most depraved of tastes. Beware too, of a certain man who goes by the moniker ‘Slavin’, which is the man who fulfils every vice an innocent visitor might find himself lured to.]

[Physical vices are not just the only thing a visitor must watch out for. Here in Thresher Street, in shop after shop, are sold various species of print and literature that will offend and outrage all but the most corrupt of sensibilities. I am told of certain light-thrower establishments that portray shows of an unmistakable nature, with seating tickets sold at prices that are dangerously within the range of a visitor’s pocket.]

[For those who have nay but a single rakel in their pockets, Jalan Sekolah’s trade school is to be avoided with the utmost precaution, as it is said that their educational staff is fraught with mysterious beauties that would lead even the most sensible Sanctum clergy astray from their path. The living wage afforded by the enrollment of the trade school is but another trap laid by such beauties who seek to ensnare young men for over a year.]

[Be not alarmed, for the district is by and large safe and blameless. Remember too that the enforcers and the Seven Snakes offer its sanctuary at all times from any of these irresponsible ventures.]

Mason had to stifle a laugh, much to the enragement of the lady, her face filled with blistering anger. “How dare you, an inquisitor, laugh at such an blatant crime being committed?”

“HAHA- Sorry, ma’am.” Mason instantly stopped sniggering, keeping a straight face, though it was clear from the tip of his eyes that he was about to burst into abrupt laughter any time. “I don’t see how this is a crime – the writer and publisher of this booklet is clearly doing the Sanctum’s work by offering good advice on where to avoid. In fact, his information is so detailed that much of my own investigative work has been put to shame.”

“And shame indeed!” The lady spat. “The most outrageous thing of all is the claim that the Crusaders Against Vices has issued this ‘guide’ that is obviously false!”

“May I inquire as to how you are so sure that it is false?”

“Because I AM the leader of the Crusaders Against Vices! And look at the indecent drawings plastered all on the back!” The furious lady jabbed towards the last few pages. 

“Well then, perhaps one of your members felt the need to inform the general public of where to stay clear of. It does indeed reduces the impact of crime in the district.”

“You…! These pamphlets are being distributed not just at stalls all over the district, but even circulating among kids. Children! If it were not for me finding out that my very own son has been reading this in secret, large swaths of residents would have been terribly afflicted.”

“I apologize, my enforcers will take this case with the utmost importance. You can rest assured that we will find the source of said publication and clamp down on it heavily.” Mason eventually managed to convince the lady to let it go, before letting a hearty laugh. *Seven Snakes, they really know how to get them going.*

However, as an inquisitor, he had no choice but to act on the evidence presented to him. With the locations and streets so blatantly described in the guide, he had to at least ‘pretend’ that he was doing something.

As soon as he stepped out of the Magda into the busy street, he could already see the pamphlet being read by about one in every five pedestrians, the publication spreading like wildfire across the South Sector. *Weird. I could have sworn only a small fraction of the population knew how to read.*

Obviously, the people reading the booklets were not exactly ‘reading’, but simply ogling at the etchings of semi-clad dancing girls alongside occupational drawings of various seductive professions, like teachers and construction workers.

The effect of the publication was immediately obvious, even to an outsider like Mason. As he approached the trade school, dozens were already queuing up in front of a makeshift table, where Niko and Keith were happily receiving the new enrolling students.

At the corner of the bustling queue, Alex was trying to convince Ollie and Bola to queue up for the trade school enrollment. "Come on, you get paid a decent wage and actually learn something! You can't spend your entire life working in the bath house. The wages might be good, but -"

"I didn't sign up with the Seven Snakes to become a nerd!" Ollie shrugged off Alex's hand vigorously. "I joined because of the shopping arcade and the job! Not to bury myself in books!"

"Idiot, if you can read and write you'll have a brighter future ahead! My daughters are signing up too - This is an order from your cobra as your squad leader!"

"I don't have to take your life advice! I'm an associate of the Seven Snakes, not a dumb student!" Bola yelled, grabbing Ollie and running off into the alleyway, leaving the frustrated Alex behind with his two daughters enrolling. 

"Fucking Damian, why the hell did he assign me two brats, I'm already having a hard time parenting..." Alex grumbled as his daughters tugged him in opposite directions, one wanting to go to a nearby cafe, while the other urged him to move along the queue.

Apart from the bickering in the Seven Snakes squad, many other students were clearly enticed by what had been written in the pamphlets and various publications issued around town by Monica, the majority being boys in the prime of their puberty.

“Can you read? Can you write? Okay, good, sign here, and you can pick up your complimentary uniform and books inside at the store.” Niko jabbed at the contract paper.

“Right!” The excited student signed with haste and wrote his name down, his scribbles hardly legible but still better than nothing. “So, where are the teachers?”

“Right this way.” Niko grinned, already anticipating the disappointment on the student’s face as he guided them in towards the elderly university graduates who would to be their ‘mysterious beauties.’ Telltale sounds of disappointment and outrage against the wrinkled saggy faces of the teachers erupted amdist the various classrooms, but it was far too late for these trapped souls. 

Mason chuckled to himself, simply walking along and tipping his cap at Keith in acknowledgement. The flow of people into the Seven Snakes district was enormous, the migration reaching a new record in the history of Raktor.

He headed to down to Thresher Street, where a few print shops were crowded to brim with factory workers clamoring for a view at the displays. The windows and shelves were packed with vicious and gaudy literature of all sorts, seemingly enabled by an improved printing press that allowed for such cheap publications. Some of the workers gathered around their colleagues, having them read out the erotica that had just been purchased, a few of them even cursing their own inability to read. 

Apart from the crowded street, underground small-scale light-thrower theatres were packed, tickets selling faster than a maggot stick in a goblin den. The new visual medium helped enrich the public's imagination, allowing them to live out fetishes they might not have dared to attempt on their own. 

Furthermore, the Sliver Snakes had just released a handheld version of the light-capturer and the light-thrower, accelerating the adoption of the product into households. Various workers splurged their entire wage onto the expensive contraptions, hoping to enjoy themselves thoroughly with one of the pre-filmed engraving plates that were immediately sold out in a day.

*How does that damn Alvin Teras keep coming up with such ludicrous inventions?* While he would have initially despised the Seven Snakes for their obvious lack of morality and decency, it was hard to say that Kyle was not improving the district, albeit in unconventional ways. It was clear to Mason that such pornographic books and materials seemed like a sure-fire method to raise literacy and entice even more people to come to the Seven Snakes district in search for more exquisite entertainment.

Memories of how Kyle slipped between the enforcers’ fingers during his arrest still irked Mason, but he now learnt that the machinations of the Seven Snakes were not something to be trifled with.

He thus closed one eye, and continued ‘patrolling’ down the street, remaining blissfully oblivious to the printed material. The Sanctum of Yual only prohibited prostitution, but had no rules against such newfangled visual mediums. Until orders came in from the top, Mason chose to not interfere at all.

[Inquisitor Mason, the Bishop has asked you to return to the Magda immediately.]

“What for?”

[An order from the Central Sector’s Bishop has been handed down.]

*An order?* Mason couldn’t recall the last time such an order was issued this way. Usually the rumours would travel through the grapevine months in advance before the declaration of an order was made. *Something’s off.*

Returning to the Magda, Mason only found Bishop Vernette pacing the breadth of her office with a slight tinge of panic. “What’s wrong?”

“They found out about the truce we have with the Seven Snakes.”

“And…?” Mason cocked his head in confusion. It was nothing new for the enforcers to cut deals with local criminal organizations to prevent anything from going into all-out war. The West Sector was the perfect example of what happens when you break the truce. *At least Kitana is having a field day there.*

“They want us to revoke it.”

Mason’s face darkened. “Who’s behind this?”

“The Central Sector’s Bishop.”

“You and I both know he’s far from able to issue such an order. Theoretically, you are on the same level as him.”

Bishop Vernette took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. “I think the Seven Snakes are getting a bit too close for comfort for Count Leon.”

“Didn’t Baron Cain negotiate a deal?”

“He did, but still, we can’t ignore the order.”

“Breaking the truce would devastate the progress the South Sector has made thus far.” Mason warned, having learnt his lesson from arresting Kyle. With the shopping arcade and the influx of jobs and houses now coming in, it would be tantamount to political suicide to suddenly reverse their stance.

Furthermore, they had already announced joint projects such as the housing complex to further boost the enforcers’ public image. The bishop was clearly conflicted with this as well, but Mason could read her expression as clear as day. “You have a solution.”

“I have. A way to play both sides.”

“Tell me.”

“We officially renounce the truce, but we do not act on it. We simply pull back all our patrols and resources from the Seven Snakes district. Tell Count Leon we won’t intervene no matter what happens, fight or not.”

“Isn’t that still a truce of sorts? How are we going to explain why we are not arresting them?”

“We can simply say that the district is too dangerous for our enforcers to enter, and that it constitutes a work hazard until we are afforded more budget.”

“Us pulling out of the district wouldn’t make the factory nor the Seven Snakes any less weak… unless…” Mason completed his thought in his brain. *Unless Count Leon has other means of undermining the weapons factory.* “Should we give them a warning?”

Bishop Vernette held a grim smile on her face. “No, we don’t want to be complicit in anything. Count Leon is going to crush the Seven Snakes, and we’re going to stay out of his way.”

@@@

“Bye bye Mister!” A young girl waved her free hand jubilantly towards a florist shop, the other holding onto a quaint little miniature pot, with a tiny flowering plant blooming in it.

“Don’t wander off too far, you go home straight now, you hear? And water it regularly every day!” The florist waved back from the shop, a gentle smile on his weathered face while he dusted off a few stray leaves on his apron, turning back into the shop to help other customers. 

The florist shop was filled with many well-dressed residents, each of them obviously considering the best arrangement for their upcoming events as they discussed with one another. He noticed a few customers voraciously reading a pamphlet, his own curious self leaning over to peek at what they were reading.

As soon as he saw the images, his face contorted slightly in suppressed rage, but still held a gentle smile as he approached another customer who was clearly having a hard time deciding.

“My good sir, that bouquet is a marvelous choice for your wedding anniversary. Or perhaps you could consider adding a tinge of red into the mix, make the yellow and white more outstanding. I suggest a Crimson Tiger Flower, though it may be on a pricey side?”

“A Crimson Tiger Flower..? I never heard of that before.” The customer in question scratched his head.

“Not to worry, I have a sample right here. Blooms right in the desert of all places, can you believe it? A great symbol of your undying love to your wife.” The florist chuckled as he pointed out a flower pot, with a spectacular large red flower the size of a plate glistening under an arctech lantern.

“That’s it… that’s it! I’ll take it.”

“Perfect. Let me wrap that up for you.”

The atmosphere was cheerfully laid-back, with the satisfied customer leaving with his humongous bouquet. The florist continued working, tending to the flowers and watering the pots until metallic boots could be heard approaching the store. He glanced up to see a squad of three arctech knights standing at the door, the leader removing his helmet to reveal a familiar face.

“Mr Leo, I need to have a word with you. In private.”

“I apologize, but I’m currently very busy as you can see.” Leo motioned to his watering can. “Perhaps we can schedule for another date.”

“It’s from the top.”

A moment of silence passed, the remaining customers inside the shop staring at the arctech knights while Leo gently put down his watering can.

“Everyone out.” Leo announced to the store, the customers unnervingly immediately leaving out onto the streets in an orderly fashion, as though they were thralls of the florist himself. The sight of the customers leaving promptly hardly fazed the three knights. 

Leo arranged for a wider space, shifting a few pots out of the way. “Please, come in. I do apologize for the mess, but there are no chairs available.”

The three knights entered, closing the door behind them and locking it, while the leader immediately began talking even though Edgar was still tending to the flowers. “Count Leon has an offer for you.”

“I know what you want. Speak to the Ardent Cretins - I have better things to do.”

“You and I both know that the Ardent Cretins are currently preoccupied with... external matters beyond Raktor.”

Leo raised his eyebrows in suspicion while he continued trimming the plants with a gardening shear. “And you came to me?”

“This offer is standing for anyone with the strength and willpower in the South Sector.”

“And what will I get if I do this?”

“Count Leon promises no retaliation from the enforcers for a year, as well as a waiver on all taxes.”

“Intriguing, and how far do I have to go?”

“As far as you want. All enforcers have stopped activity in the Seven Snakes District.”

"For what reason did Sebastian reject this?"

"I am not privy to their private discussions."

"If Sebastian and Ares were hesitant to take up the offer, what makes you think I will? I'm still recovering from the war - not everyone got out unscathed."

"Consider the possibility of absorbing all of Seven Snakes." The leader pressed his persuasive speech, expressions hidden under the helmet.

“Not good enough. I will be severely weakened if I fought them head-on - Kyle has more than proved his strength. If you want a dog to eat another stronger dog, you’re going to have to offer more.”

“Or Count Leon could just starve you himself, and find another dog.” The knight leader chuckled.

“He can try.” A loud snip from Leo's gardening tool echoed through the store. “He can most certainly try.”

“The offer still stands. It’s either you, or the others. Your choice. The final objective is simply to neutralize the Seven Snakes' ability to hold their economy together. Both you and Count Leon have a common goal in this, otherwise you will be left behind in the dust.”

Leo stood motionless for a moment. “I will consider it. You may expect my reply in three days.”

The meeting ended as abruptly as it began, the three arctech knights leaving instantly. Leo let out a sigh, placing his gardening shears into the deep pockets of his apron. The tough decision weighed on his mind heavily - not because he did not want to harm the Seven Snakes, but rather because he saw no way to do so.

He furrowed his brows, his mind deep in contemplation as he headed towards the storeroom behind the cashier. Amdist the neatly arranged rows of empty pots and seed packets, a muffled whimper drifted through the damp cold air.

Leo let out an exasperated sigh to himself as he approached three men tied to wooden chairs, their eyes blindfolded and their mouths gagged with a cloth. The first of them began to shiver uncontrollably as he heard Leo’s footsteps approaching him, struggling to break free.

He knelt down, coming face to face with the blindfolded man, gripping the first man's chin and checking his cheeks without speaking a word. The man whimpered as Leo grabbed and patted each part of the man's body, finally reaching the the still bloody stumps that used to be the designer legs, the chair rocking back and forth heavily.

“I brought you out of the slums, and for a measly 25000 rakels you scamper away to our enemies. It made me think - do arctech designers really need legs?” Leo kicked the designer right in the jaw, causing the chair to topple over as the designer's head slammed against the nearby pots, his amputated stumps flailing in the air with blood spurting.

*Kyle is slowly draining resources from the entire South Sector, and he even managed to overshadow Sebastian's shopping arcade through his public pandering and sabotage.* Leo faced a conundrum with regards to Count Leon's offer. Sebastian's rejection was a big red flag for him, but if Leo did not do anything, he would eventually be bled dry of skilled labor and residents to extort. *What good is a gang with no one to profit off?*

Leo glanced around at the other three prisoners, his mind racking together, wondering if there was a way to bring down the Seven Snakes without a military confrontation. They were still licking their wounds after the Ilysian Punks War, and many other minor gangs and rackets were now eyeing them, seeing them as the weakest of the pack. Suddenly a flash of inspiration hit Leo, a small smile slowly blossoming in his face as he started to put a plan together.

The second prisoner was more composed but still showed a few signs of fear when Leo approached him. "It seems all three of your lives still have worth." Leo murmured as he grabbed the second prisoner's head, shaking it violently. "But know this: if you ever lie to me, the Mane of the Red Lion, one more time, you won't be dying peacefully anytime soon. This is your last chance, Wrent. Try not to fuck it up."
# Chapter 77 - Incursion

The first week of operation of the factory proceeded smoothly despite the hiccups in employment and training. Gordon innovated a few other methods of compartmentalizing the assembly process, making it easier for the factory workers to become productive. 

Veteran technicians, trade school students and new Seven Snakes recruits alike worked hand-in-hand, filling up the gaps and pumping out rifle after rifle. It soon became second-nature to many of the workers and the foreman, enabling the production teams to slowly perform their own quality control.

At the same time, the durability and strength of the new materials were tested thoroughly, many of the variations and compositions not making the cut. Kyle spent most of his hours figuring out how best to create a new stronger material that could beat the competition. 

Yet he could not utilize his previous knowledge of Galactic Era defense systems. Even if he had still retained his cranial implant on resurrection, it would still be nearly impossible to achieve the temperatures and gravitational control parameters required to manufacture some of the more exotic alloys that were commonplace during his time. 

After all, he had to remain small as well. The existence of the exosuit spine he had won at the auction and other relics were a clear sign that there were others who may understand Galactic Era technology, and begin to target him.

*I'll have to start small.* Kyle watched on as a few Seven Snakes associates test-fired the newly produced standard rifles against the prototype materials in a makeshift firing range enclosed within the Aspis Weapons Factory which were propped on wooden crosses, enduring pellet after pellet. 

"Sir." The older designer in charge of leading Team A was already there, measuring the depth of impacts on a few specimens. "As we can see in the chainmail variation, it seems to be perfectly aligned with our requirement. Just on penetration alone, it is performing quite well against standard lead and iron bullets."

"Put the specimen up again in lane 12. Have the light-capturers set up." Kyle ordered a few workers while hauling his long briefcase onto an empty table, opening to reveal parts of a special gun that the Team A lead designer had never seen before, his questions only restrained by a glare from Kyle. 

Kyle carefully assembled the sniper rifle together, though in his mind it was hardly an sniper rifle. *What kind of sniper rifle can only have a range of 500 meters?* However, it was by far the most powerful single shot weapon in his arsenal currently - making a new one would have to wait until he was done with the military contract. 

The lead designer's face paled as Kyle continued to assemble the elongated barrel piece by piece, the engravings along the side intricate. "By Yual, what the..." 

Kyle ignored the stares of the Team A designers who were now crowding around him, instead focusing on fine-tuning the gun, making sure the engravings were all aligned correctly before latching them into place. He heaved the entire rifle with one single arm, resting it at the range aimed right at the target of lane 12, where a thin chainmail already dented with holes was waiting. 

With a single pull, the recoil sent a shudder through the makeshift firing range, the temporary partitions vibrating violently from the sudden launch as the pellet tore through the chainmail like a sheet of paper, the wooden cross behind snapping in half. 

"Get the captured engraving into a light-thrower."

The recorded flight of the bullet was tabulated, using the marking along the walls and estimating the time of flight by using the frame rate of the light-capturer. With this, Kyle continued putting various iterations of the chainmail specimens, firing shot after shot. 

Each of the chainmail prototypes failed to resist the penetration effect, most of them a gaping hole torn through them.

"Not good enough at all. If this armour cannot handle this amount of energy at least more than three times, its a failure."

The designers erupted into a furor at the obvious tall order, some of them clamoring towards the Team A lead designer. "Elder Buron, what the hell are we going to do now?" Yet Lead Designer Buron did not respond, his face glinting with excitement at the prospect of the challenge, only motioning with his hand to another designer to bring out the next testing specimen. 

"This next specimen is a steel plate doped with arcite ore as well as a few additional materials. Even with your elongated rifle, there's no way you'll penetrate it!" Buron stuck his chest out with pride. "Countless overtime hours have been put in over the last seven days to find the perfect combination-"

His speech was interrupted by a loud bang, the pellet fired from the rifle whizzing past in a blur, slamming into the steel plate. For a brief moment Buron grinned, half-expected the doped steel plate to hold, only for the pellet to tear through it, albeit less easily than the chainmail. This time, the pellet had disintegrate from the impact, though there was still a clear burnt mark on the wooden cross behind. 

Kyle repeated the test, making sure the results were repeatable.Even a doped plate with increases thickness was unable to resist the ballistic impact.

"Slightly better... Anything else?"

Buron's heart sank, having lost hope only for another brave Team B designer to step up. "I have one!"

"Good, bring it up to lane 12. Replace the wooden figure."

As Kyle checked on his rifle, Buron hurriedly grabbed the Team B designer. "What other specimens do we have?! You're not even from our team! Were we not working on the chainmail and the steel arcite alloys?!"

"I've found an interesting concept from Proco during my visit to the markets and when designing the layout of the armour. Just watch!"

Kyle overheard the discussion, slightly intrigued as a similar steel plate was placed on the range. However, instead of it being a simple bland steel plate, this one was a composite, with the middle layer filled to brim with what seemed to be standard sand, sandwiched between two doped steel layers. 

"Idiot, what good would sand do agains-" Before Buron could interrogate the designer, Kyle fired another pellet. A loud impact echoed through the range, the friction eroding the silicate particles in an intense fury apart. Yet surprisingly the back armour plate itself was intact, though the dent on the front was severe. Sand poured out of the hole, leaking like a sack of rice.

"Interesting." Kyle was well aware of composite armour - starships in the Galactic Era still relied on it, albeit with the layers numbering in the dozens. This simplifed armour was a step towards the winning formula that they needed to prove their capabilites to the Raktor armed forces. With this, he had plausible deniability to throw off anyone suspecting him of knowing too much, able to shift the heat to the designers.

Just as Buron was about to celebrate and take credit for something he didnt do, Kyle fired yet another shot, the pellet hitting the same spot dead on. In one fell swoop, the pellet tore through the backplate, and the thin steel layers began to fracture rapidly, the entire plate cracked apart from the center, breaking into multiple pieces.

"Combine the concept of the chainmail with this composite armour." Kyle drew up a quick schematic on a rough piece of paper, revealing a honeycomb structure of steel. "Fill the gaps with all types of sand, have them fused up to t

200 degrees. Quench, temper, try everything. Choose the one that has the best impact dispersion. We want to make sure the longitudinal wave is not too severe that the entire structure flexes and cracks."

The designers stared at Kyle, their expressions flabbergasted at what Kyle had just said. Not even Buron had any idea what the hell he was talking about, the words coming out of Kyle's mouth sounding like esoteric ritual spells. They murmured between each other, trying to figure out whether anyone understood what just happened. 

Kyle ignored their blank stares, leaving the schematic with them as he went to check on the standard rifles, which were supposed to be improved by Team C. New Seven Snakes recruits were rotated back and forth as they went through vigorous testing of the arcia consumption limits of the new rifle, piles upon piles of struggling bodies trying to recover from arcia exhaustion. 

"It seems to be working." A Team C designer reported to Kyle. "The fresh recruits can now fire up to seven times, so a trained soldier should be able to fire ten."

"Money is not made from assumptions, it is made from certainty. Get Baron Cain's knights to test them out."

Overall, the weapon and armour design was improving rapidly, spurred by the high salary and the continuous tips offered by Kyle. On the other side, Gordon still oversaw the production team, which were now arranged into twenty assembly lines. Rows upon rows of arcia etchers that dangled from flimsy steel frames were tightly gripped by workers, carving delicately by following the grooves on the already rounded plates. 

The continuous hiss of heat-treated steel breastplates and carved barrels reigned supreme in the air, amdist the never-ending hammering of steel presses and workers hammering the plates into shape. With the process now divided properly, production was as smooth as long as they kept the supply up. 

Logistical support staff continuously ferried fresh materials from the Culdao Peaks, keeping stock of each assembly line everyday and making sure they had enough to manufacture their target goals. 

[Sir, I have your updated report on the other gangs..] Adrian spoke on the radio while Kyle inspected the produced rifles. 

"Go ahead."

[First, an update on the Ardent Cretins. It is confirmed that both Sebastian and Ares are out of town in Kregol, but they will be returning shortly in a few days. The information is outdated, so they could very well be back in Raktor.]

"Understood." Kyle understood what Sebastian was trying to do - expand outwards instead of contesting within the city. Just like how he had occupied the Culdao Peaks and ousted the Violet Demon's bandits from the forest, the Ardent Cretins were now doing the same with Kregol. Yet Kyle felt that it was not worth it - if he were Sebastian, he would immediately leverage his ability to crush the remaining three gangs in the South Sector without hesitation. *Unless he is planning for something else...*

[The Wretches have been closed off, it's hard to get information on them. They are keeping a tight lid on anyone or anything going out of their districts, but they don't seem to be taking any offensive actions.]

"Got it."

[As for the Red Lions.... Wrent hasn't been seen for quite some time. The last known location was deep in the Red Lions' district, near their headquarters.]

"Then they must have already caught on to what is happening. Is there an imminent attack?"

[No sir, none of the Red Lions are making a move. Instead, they are pulling back all of their members from the contested streets between us.]

"Weird. No mobilization?" Kyle half-expected the Red Lions to react to the brain-drain in a similar fashion as the Ilysian Punks. Most gangs would immediately attempt to antagonize him to keep the pressure high and prevent their own district residents from migrating over.

[Nothing at all boss. Although, because of the retreat, there are more people coming to apply for our housing program now.]

"Hmm..." Kyle sensed a plot brewing, but he still could not put his finger on what was happening. "Have Gordon and Keith ensure that a proper background check is performed. Anyone coming from the Red Lions district should be thoroughly investigated. We don't want any surprises."

[Understood.]

*If the Red Lions plan is to try and steal the engravings so as to establish their own industry, they will be sorely disappointed*. 

@@@

The temporary job distribution center was packed to the brim, with new applicants from all over the South Sector jostling for a chance to get in. 

They had to, for the housing complex did not have infinite capacity - it was clear to anyone who had even paid attention to the sheer public media push by the Golden Snakes Construction Company.

Originally derided as an unsafe district ran by hooligans, the former Versian District was now the land of dreams for anyone looking to get a better life. 

The applicants came from everywhere - villagers from afar looking to start anew, homeless families seeking a chance again, addicts wanting to coast by on a simple job and many others. Some of them had already been rejected by the trade school due to their illiteracy.

At the helm of the swarm of people elbowing each other to squeeze in through the doors, Guang Hwa desparately tried to control the situation from getting out of control.

*Shit, I thought being a company head meant a good life. Yet I'm out here trying to reign in idiots!* Guang Hwa naturally had no loyalty to Kyle nor the Seven Snakes, which is why he had two veteran cobras acting as his 'bodyguards', both of them able to activate the slave collar in an instant if Guang Hwa ever tried to betray them.

He sighed, resigned to his fate as he continued speaking through the microphone. [Everyone, there are more than enough houses to go around! Please queue up!]

The surge of applicants hardly heeded his pleas, instead choosing to push even harder, a few of them even getting into scuffles, throwing punches with their children cries neverending. 

[Stop fighting, there's enough for everyone!] Guang Hwa headed down the stage, trying to break up one of the fights, only to get hit right in the chin by a stray elbow from an angry applicant.

Instead of apologizing to Guang Hwa, the angry applicant continue forcing his way through before finally being restrained by two Seven Snakes recruits, both of whom were already showing clear signs of disdain for the rowdy applicants as they dragged him away.

The other recruits who served as guards gritted their teeth as they continuously shoved belligerent applicants back.

"Where the hell are the enforcers?" One of the fresher recruits grumbled as he forcibly restrained a struggling applicant to the ground. "I signed up to be a gangster, not some security dog!"

As he stood up, his complaints earned him a smack from Niko."Idiot, this is our territory! And why are you still relying on enforcers?"

The bruised Guang Hwa internally snapped, immediately getting up and screaming into the microphone. [THIS IS YOUR LAST FUCKING WARNING! WE HAVE LIGHT-CAPTURERS ALL OVER THE CENTER - ANYONE WHO IS STILL FIGHTING WILL BE ARRESTED! YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE!]

The ragged crowd halted for a brief moment, contemplating their next move when a few smarter folks snuck in through the confusion, cutting the queue and forcing their way into the center.

Without hesitation, an uproar rose through the queue, as the fighting and chaos became even worse.

[FINE! EVERYONE BEYOND THIS LINE IS OUT! LEAVE IN THIRTY SECONDS OR YOU WILL BE ARRESTED!]

"By who? I don't see any enforcers around here!" One of the more oblivious applicants from beyond the city hollered, expecting the others around him to join in.

Instead he turned to only see more than half of the crowd disperse like rats scampering away from an ensuing flood. "What the..."

The oblivious applicant had no time to think, an impact driving deep into his ribs as he was tackled to the ground by Niko.

Guang Hwa grinned as he saw them scurry away like ants, relishing in the power. Yet the nagging reminder that Kyle had him as a slave put a damper to that.

While the queue was brought back under control, a ragged homeless man stood in line, seemingly compliant. Yet the glint in his eyes betrayed his clear intellect for anyone keen enough to spot him. Both Niko and Guang Hwa did not see the man, the two focused on making sure everything else ran smoothly.

As the man approached the front of the queue, he exchanged a knowing glance with one of the processing clerks, before revealing the tip of a jade bracelet. 

"Next, please. Yes, you over there." The processing clerk motioned to the same ragged homeless man, who shuffled over with a conspicuous limb. "Please, take a seat."

The man sat carefully, his arms resting on the counter to reveal multiple bruises and cuts that were just healing. 

The processing clerk slid over a glass of water on a coaster, the man quickly grabbing it and gulping hurriedly as though he had just crossed a desert. "Name?"

"Gunther." The man wiped a trickle off his chin, his energetic eyes already locking onto the two bodyguards for a brief moment.

"Occupation?"

"Farmer."

"Farmer? From which part?"

"Near Ocra. Had a few pigs I hold dear, but sold them to make my way here in hopes of a better life."

"I'm sure the pigs still miss you." The processing clerk penned the information down onto a template form. "We may have a few jobs in that area that would suffice. How good are you with your hands?"

"Not as good as my mouth, I am afraid. Nothing compared to my brother, of course." 

The two shared a laugh, though if anyone was looking closely, it was a mirthless laughter.

"You mentioned you had a brother. Any other family members?"

"17 brothers and sisters blessed by those above and my master, but all of them have scattered into the wind ever since our home had been burned down. It pains me to have yet to find them, but I am confident that I am close to one. Very close."

"I too, wish you the very best in your endeavors. So, any preference in jobs?"

"I would like to apply to be a technician in the Aspis Weapons Factory."

"The weapons factory has a stringent background check. It may take a few days before you are cleared."

"The road to a better future is always long and narrow."

"Indeed." The processing clerk finished up the documentation, drafting up a temporary pass. "The Golden Snakes Construction Company welcomes you. You'll be assigned a temporary waiting location until your apartment has been prepared. You may or may not be sharing rooms with others."

"Not a problem, I am ready to work for my future, no matter how hard it gets."

"That's the spirit." The processing clerk grinned, stamping a seal of approval on the documents, the name written down clearly different from what was said. "Looking forward to work you, Ki Hwang. The Society welcomes your help."

The man grabbed the coaster under the glass, keeping it in-between the layers of shabby cloths covering his body before reaching over for a firm handshake. "Of course. Together we will strike against tyranny. For the Goddess."

# Chapter 78 - Martyr

Progress was swift over the next two weeks, with the Aspis Weapons Factory slowly building up their capabilities and expertise. However, the Seven Snakes now faced a serious issue - there were now far more applicants to the housing project than they could employ across all their subsidiaries.

"We're running out of jobs, we'll need to expand even more." Keith explained to Kyle, listing down the expansion plans of each of the businesses. "But with the Ardent Cretins still enforcing an embargo on us, it's hard for us to get any construction projects beyond our influence, and our finances are tight as of now."

The Golden Snakes Construction Company was simply building housing projects now in a never-ending cycle, providing menial jobs for untrained workers to fill by using the dirty money earned from prostitution, alcohol and the sale of addictive potions. However, there would soon come a limit on how much they could build. Furthermore, with the land prices across the districts increasing rapidly, it would be hard to legally purchase the deeds to the buildings. 

Their accounts were also running low, most of the expenses pushing advertising and media publications to attract more workers. Niko and his men were turning up more and more pop-up slums around the factory, hidden away in dilapidated housings while the dwellers tried to snatch or steal wages from the workers.

Despite Keith's flustered expression as he poured over the statistics, Kyle was leaning back leisurely, knowing that he was on the verge of attaining a critical mass of population. He looked at the results of the recent population census, an initiative ordered by him to tally up the number of heads he had in the district, along with the economical data. Optimal wages and pricing for various products were calculated as a whole swath of clerks ran number after number in a large human calculator. 

It was clear that discontentment was slowly increasing among those who did not manage to get into the housing project, or could find a job. "Perhaps we should allow some of them to stay in the apartments even if we do not have a job to offer them..."

"Out of the question. If you give an inch, they will take a mile." Kyle was laser focused on the balancing act, optimizing for the perfect ratio of good public perception and amount of crime he could get away with. "By the way, I have not heard of anything from Mason nor Bishop Vernette. Where are the enforcers?"

"Word is that they are running low on budgeting, so they are cutting down patrol requirements. Mason told me that the enforcers will stay out of the Seven Snakes district for the time being and let us handle the housing project."

"Hmm..." Kyle was not too concerned whether or not the enforcers were here - as long as the threat of releasing handguns into the general populace hung over their heads, Inquisitor Mason and Bishop Vernette would hardly dare to antagonize him. 

"Is it a problem, boss?"

"There are no problems - only opportunities waiting to be exploited. Since the enforcers have pulled out of the districts, we have full control over everything in the district. Have the new recruits act as the policing force, and start expanding all of our businesses. Make as many new branches as possible for the brothel, pubs and casino. After all, there are more than enough willing labour to work there."

"Understood. What about money?"

"Does not matter. Do what we need to expand."

Having too much labour on hand was a happy problem to solve, as long as Kyle could keep them satisified. Public projects such as the cleaning of streets, free soup kitchens as well as the shopping arcade bathhouse helped to raise the standard of living. But with more and more migrants coming into the district, the infrastructure of roads and streets were starting to become more and more congested, severely impacting mobility. 

Cobblestone paths were packed to the brim with wagons and carts of all sorts, with the more entrepreneurial residents opening food stalls which severely restricted the flow of traffic even more with their temporary seating arrangements and winding queues. The shopping arcade could only offer so much capacity to feed the residents. Already the Aspis Weapons Factory and trade schools' canteen were crowded, workers crammed like sardines as they shovelled radish stews down for a simple calorie boost. 

"Boss, if we expand now, our current financial runway will plummet to three months." Keith pointed out. "And that's not including the salary's cost so far nor the bargaining with land and building owners."

"Do it - the weapons contract in a month's time will make us whole again." Kyle dismissed Keith's concern. "As a temporary boost in the event that we do not make money from the weapons contract, have Reese begin selling the handheld light-capturers and light-throwers en-masse as soon as possible. We've spent long enough gatekeeping to assure the market of our unassailable position. I will work on finding alternate venues of money." *Perhaps the creation of a new drug is in order.* It's been a while since he made anything new - the Euria-infused potions were getting a bit stale. 

Keith complied, quickly relaying the order to Reese and issuing offers to buildings in order to purchase them over. However, the prices that he had been quoted by the various landowners were near exorbitant, more than three times the prevailing market price. Every owner knew that the Seven Snakes had money, and were naturally not going to let go of a potential good deal. 

Kyle watched with an amused expression as Keith tried to haggle and threaten the landowner on the other end of the line. "Good sir, your asking price is far too high! No sane gentlemen worth his salt would suggest such a ridiculous price!"

[The bottom line is this - you pay me what I ask, and you will have the land deed. Otherwise, you can forget about it! You're not going to get a better deal anywhere else.] The landowner hung up on him, leaving a frustrated Keith slamming the holster of his chair out of anger, causing Kyle to let out a slight chuckle. 

"Look at you, getting so flustered when someone tells you no. Just because we're legal now, doesn't mean we should forget our roots. I'll handle this." Kyle left, heading for another discreet base, a separate location that had been set up to mask the original handgun manufacturing. The exterior had been shaped up to be an ugly concrete building, featuring nearly no windows at all. A simple sign of the Alchemist Guild hung outside, the issued license and expiry date clear for everyone to see. 

The building was an empty shell of itself, a former office building that used to be packed with traders and company accountants. Now, nearly every facade of its former business had been wiped clean, saved for the large old mechanical arctech clock that hummed away quietly in an empty courtyard. 

Through the winding hallways bereft of any decorations, the once empty maze of office rooms were a sterile clean room, the floor tiles eerily pure white without a single stain. Large fans featured prominently in vast vents layered with multiple layers of sheets, filtering air that came in, their continuous rotation repetitive and soothing. If it weren't for the intermittent hellish screams from the rooms beyond, it might be considered to be a mediation hall of sorts. 

Kyle pushed his body past a wall of iron chains, revealing a small chemistry lab, dozens of alchemist apprentices hard at work while Haui relaxed at a corner, sipping on a colorful straw from a quaint little glass bottle, the label of the Seductive Serpent brewery engraved into the surface. 

"I must say, you do know how to make these drinks. Give my thanks to Eric, he's as much of an alchemist as I am, though we differ on objectives." Haui smiled as he sipped happily, enjoying the unique fruity taste. 

"I need an update on the program. It's been far too long."

"It's only been three months since the war ended, progress cannot be rushed, especially when one seeks to discover the meaning of nature." Haui slowly got up from his reclining chair, heading over to a table and picking up a small little glass bottle, tightly capped. 

"Is this it?"

"It's as pure as we could get it."

Kyle held the glass bottle in his hand, the viscous yellow liquid slowly flowing like honey within as he examined it. 

MG404: [Absolute Euria Seed Extract | Pure addiction, unfiltered | Warning: will inflict critical addiction symptoms. Lethal at 100ml consumption.]

"And the tests?"

"See for yourself."

Haui led him down the lab, where muffled screams and cries were the only background noise, drowned out by a uncharacteristically jazzy upbeat tune playing on the arctech speakers installed around. Rows upon rows of solitary cells were filled with humans and goblins, all prisoners who were suffering from severe addiction except for a few who served as a placebo control experiment. 

The cells were arranged orderly, a simple slip of paper detailing the parameters of the experiment performed. Some of the cells' occupants were already dead, their body contorted in a violent rush of self-mutilation, their skin ripped raw from their own nails. Kyle and Haui merely observed them, not caring at all for those still suffering.

"We've ran multiple dosages, directly doping their water supply in increasing percentages. The sweet spot is about five parts per hundred."

"Onset time period?"

"Within three days or less, assuming no more consumption, irritability, lethargic movement, and slurred speech will start to kick in. The withdrawal lasts for two weeks before subsiding. Consumption of any portion of Euria Seed, even by smoke inhalation, will lengthen the withdrawal symptoms proportionally."

"Production rate?"

"It's slow. Extraction ratio is 50 to 1 in terms of mass, and the repeated purification cycles will take a week. However, unlike the potions, addiction is guaranteed with this one."

"Hmm..." Kyle swirled the honey-like substance in his hands. "We're the only ones with such a drug on hand? No one else has access to this, correct? I do hope you are not selling it."

"No, this is exclusive for us."

"Good enough for now. But I need you to find other potential avenues of improving the production. It does not need to be pure - a composite will be fine. "

"I have some ideas, I will work on it." Haui agreed, watching Kyle pocket the 100ml bottle of Absolute Euria. "But if you need a lethal poison or a paralyzing potion, I already have them in store. You could just simply purchase them off me instead of wasting time on such a slow acting extract."

"You and I measure effectiveness through different lenses." Kyle replied as he prepared to leave. "You want them dead - but dead men are of no use to me. All life have purpose, and I simply help them to find their full potential, if they are willing."

"And what if they are not willing?"

"I'll make sure to change their minds."

@@@

*Three days later...*

"Papa, the water tastes funny." A small kid gagged as he took a sip from the fine glass that twinkled under the chandeliers, his short legs barely reaching the marble floor tiles of the grand dining room. The water in the glass swirled with a tinge of yellowish taint.

"Not now, son, I'm busy." The father at the head of the dining table shooed him off, focusing on reading the newspapers laid out in front of him, pouring through the articles. "Weird, the Sliver Snakes's new handheld light-capturers are a rousing success... despite my misgivings, I must say the product worked just as marketed." He himself possessed a new model of the handheld light-capturer, though he had yet to use it to its full extent. Just as he was about to flip over to the next page, an arctech phone on another table rang. 

The father hurriedly reached over to pick it up, earning a complaint from his attention-starved son. "Why do you always respond immediately to the phone, but not to me?"

"Servants! If you could please have my son finish his meal and retire to his room. I'm busy right now." The father paid no heed any longer to the grumbling son, instead listening to the call. "This is Stanley, who's calling?"

[Mr Stanley, how was your discussion with the Seven Snakes?]

"Ah, Mr Gunther! Of course, it went just as you have expected it to."

[Good. When we are all united as one, we shall all earn a bigger slice of the pie. Soon, the Seven Snakes will capitulate to our demands.]

Stanley let out a grin. "Yes, you are right. I can only blame my former short-sighted self for nearly selling it at a small profit."

[Do not understand the power of collective action - it can even force the greatest to crumble. But I must inform you to be wary of your surroundings and person. The Seven Snakes are known to employ treacherous methods to get what they want. Do let me know of any suspicious activities.]

"Speaking of suspicious activities, I've just read about a new line of portable light-capturers and light-throwers being released to the general public for anyone to buy. What does this mean? I originally believed that they were going to continuously corner the market by restricting supply." The actions of the Seven Snakes perplexed him - any self-respecting businessmen would hardly invest additional rakels into a new product line when the old was entrenched well.

[Perhaps they are gathering the resources necessary to comply to our demands! Either way, it is good to keep an eye out for such things. I must go now, we will convene at a later meeting to discuss our next steps.]

"Aha, of course! Why did I not see it that way! I understand now, Mr Gunther, I will remain vigilant."

The warning hardly landed as he put down the phone, the thought of being able to collect a hefty profit from the sale of his property leaving him giddy and light-hearted. "Bring out the wine! Tonight I'm celebrating. Has my wife not yet returned home?"

"Sir, she is still out shopping in the shopping arcade."

"Have her return to the house immediately, with such an important deal on the line, I cannot have her remain an exposed liability. The Seven Snakes may attempt to kidnap her." Stanley ordered. 

As he returned to the dining table, he soon spotted the slight yellow tinge in the cup of water that the servants were getting his son to drink, the warning from Mr Gunther raised Stanley's awareness to high heights. "Hold on, what's in the water? Has it not been boiled beforehand?"

"Yes, sir, it has." A meek servant replied, only fueling Stanley's anxiety as his son coughed violently.

"Call the doctor in immediately! Son, are you feeling alright?" He hurriedly ordered, kneeling next to his son who was bewildered at the sudden attention from his dad.

"Sir, I have your wine." Another servant called out, carrying a bottle from Eric Dicar and a thin clear wine glass.

"Are you crazy? Now is not the time for win- hold on, who are you? And you! Who told you to bring out the handheld light-capturer? You're not my servants!"

"Of course not, Mr Stanley. For all men are equal under the Goddess."

Before Stanley could react, the edge of the wine glass was forcibly slammed into his neck, the fragile glass shards lodging themselves deep into the flesh, burrowing into the vocal cords.

Each involuntary breath dragged the glass shards across his throat, ripping apart blood vessels from within as he suffered stab after stab, his limbs flailing wildly in a desparate bid to protect himself. He tried to speak, but the glass shards only dug deeper.

The sudden violence caught the son offguard, his face blank as he watched the stranger stab Stanley repeatedly, Stanley's body convulsing with each strike.

Soon, there was nothing left of the glass, the stranger tossing away the broken handle. "So those above remember their roots."

"So shall they return to dust." The other servants responded immediately, the son frightened out of his mind as he tried to scream, only for the stranger to grab his mouth, caressing the son's hair gently with bloodstained hands.

"Search the house. Everything of value is to be sold for the cause. Arrange the scene."

The servants moved like clockwork, some scouring the house for valuables to pawn off, while others began to thrash the existing decor of the property.

Another two began to tie up Stanley's body, stringing ropes around his wrist before using a kitchen knife to gut his innards out, though taking great care to make sure they remained attached.

The son struggled against the stranger, but his grip was far too strong, the son's head forced to face the brutal treatment of his father's body.

"You are far too young to understand, but yet you represent the original sin. No amount of repentance can cleanse your soul. Be at peace."

The stranger finally let go of the son, the son hurriedly running off, only to be tackled by two servants dressed up as Seven Snakes recruits, their temporary armbands visible with the insignia.

They grabbed the son and blindfolded him, forcing him to kneel on the floor facing the light-capturer.

"Ready."

"Begin."

"You, speak your name. To the light-capturer." One of the fake recruits slapped the son on the head, but the son was too terrified to say anything. 

Only the sharp tip of the kitchen knife could prompt the son to begin speaking. "M...my name..."

"Speak up!"

"My... my.. my name is Kelvin of house Roset."

"How old are you?"

"E...eight years old."

"And who is your father?"

"M... my father is dead!" The son burst out crying, his head immediately slammed against the floor, crushing his front teeth inwards.

"Your father, Stanley Roset, is a evil landlord who wishes to gouge the society at large by charging exorbitant rents, living on interest payments! Raising land prices at a time of poverty and exploitation!"

The son couldnt reply, not with his face buried in the floor, tears and blood streaming down his face.

"Let this be known that the Seven Snakes will not tolerate those who work against society, those who prey on the weak and the poor. Not even their offspring will be spared."

The last thing the son could feel was the sharp jolting pain of the knife's blade, slowly carving into his neck before a sense of weightlessness took over, his body no longer attached. 

# Chapter 79 - Nature of Arcia

Kyle glanced at the vial of Absolute Euria, wondering on how to use it properly. He could use it on the landowners and force them to submit over time, slowly gaining control. *There's no reason to rush it just yet. Any sudden shock would have the public turn against us.*

He set the vial down on the top of the workbench, next to the Ancient Exosuit Spine that he had purchased from the auction last year. 

MG404: [Item | Ancient Exosuit Spine | *Lost technology created in the Galactic Era, unusable without thorough refurbishment.* | Active Skill: Nerval Jack – Enables an exosuit pilot to wield a suit through a nerval distribution network. Requires an operational exosuit.]

While the rest of the Seven Snakes were hard at work, Kyle too had always been hard at work to improve his own skill set as well as his arsenal with his own personal workshop well furnished. After all, it was power from which all authority stemmed from - he had to ensure that he was always one step ahead of the game. The development of composite armour as well as armour layout made a potential exosuit construction more and more feasible.

Unfortunately, he had hit a conceptual roadblock in advancing his understanding of how arcia works and the nature of arctech language. He had hoped the ancient spine might work as expected , as he understood electricity very well. However, it was hard to do anything with the spine, especially given that he had none of the manipulators nor fabricators necessary to repair it, nor did he have the correct power source to energize it.

His attempts to scavenge samples and resources from the Oracle's lab in the Culdao Peaks also proved to be useless, the metal nanite virus having eaten away most of the functionality of anything left, degrading most components to individually useless base elements. He could attempt to cannibalize the components of the A.I. core, but doing so would severely compromise the benefits of the seed storage. For now, all he had was this spine to work off, albeit one that could not be activated.

Yet the spine offered a glimpse into his forgotten knowledge, allowing him to gleam a few concepts that had once been stored in his cranial implant. If he could utilize the learnings in the production of the arctech knight armour set, it should ensure that he had a healthy lead over his potential competitors. 

The main conceptual working of the exosuit spine was to serve as the central connection bus to the rest of the exosuit armour. However, Kyle did not possess a nerval plug on his body to use it in anyway, nor could he install one himself. The procedure was far too complicated for any surgeon of this age to do so, the potential infection and corruption of the biological nervous system too dangerous.

However, the existence of arctech engravings gave a potential alternative to develop a prototype arctech spine built around the same idea. After all, the nervous control of the spine was a series of electrical impluses - all he had to do was to map them to an arctech impluse instead. 

Kyle drew up a series of mock arctech engravings, etching them onto spare pieces of metal to see their effectiveness and outcome. Despite his considerable experience in copying and improving engravings, mapping the entire nervous movement of a human body was far beyond his limit. The key lacking factor in his understanding of how arcia worked was the lack of variability - it generally seemed that all engravings that he had made so far had a fixed output of sorts. 

*Only Penchant of Violence has some scaling involved with combat stats.* Kyle could hardly see the engravings in his own body, much less study them. Instead he turned to another engraving which he knew had a form of variability - the arctech wagon's mechanical convertor. Since the speed of the wagon could be throttled, Kyle searched for clues for the missing piece necessary to allow for a variable input rather than a fixed consumption, yet to no avail.

On the far end of the workbench was a series of textbooks on arcia, augmented his collection from his original Treatise on Arcia by Theorin, which by itself was incomplete. The new textbooks were however, clearly also incomplete, with much of the effects of many arcia engravings being attributed to more esoteric causes rather than a scientific study. Through consistent reading over the last three months, Kyle was able to slowly piece together certain standard coherent rules behind the utilization of arcia. 

MG404: [Title Obtained | Bookworm (Basic) | *A crime lord must be, above all, literate enough to know the charges levied against him* | +10 INT, +25% reading and comprehension speed for written text.]

However, each new arcia engraving challenged his prevailing set of derived rules, making him wonder if arcia was truly an exotic element that could not be understood until he had reached a higher level of technology. For now, he could make a few basic assumptions, the first of which was that the direction of arcia flow mattered significantly. 

All engravings that Kyle had worked on so far were not closed loops, instead a single starting point moving towards an end point, where it could be then linked to other engravings. Arranging the engravings in the correct order from start to finish was what gave it its properties. This was not entirely different from electricity, in which components had to be laid out in a coherent sequence in order to achieve the circuit's intended purpose. 

However, the difference laid in what occurred when the flow of arcia was reversed or disrupted. Assuming that the arcia flow was similar to electricity, a reversal would result in a electrical short or an overheating of engravings with high resistance, like a diode. 

Kyle held a copy of Riker's pipe in his hand, the first engraving that he had copied more than a thousand times at this point

MG404: [Item | Engraved Metal Pipe (Basic) | A pipe to bend the rules | Active Skill: Reinforcement – Increased force when hitting. MP Cost Per Activation: 2 MP. Duration: Thirty Seconds. Cooldown: Two minutes.]

As he powered it up with a swing, the engravings gleamed yellow as expected, the inefficiency of the engraving emitted as visible light. While he continued swinging, he activated his Subclass skill on it. *Arcia Disruption!*

Instead of the engraving emitting a bright yellow glow, little white droplets began to form rapidly on the surface of the pipe, slowly coating it in its entirety before one of the droplets burst, revealing a small little insect the size of a hair, lazily flying and leaving a corroded hole on the originally smooth metal finish. 

One by one, the eggs began to burst, the ensuing rush of insects fluttering around mindlessly in a harmless swarm, many of them carelessly bumping into the walls and ceiling, while Kyle stood in the midst of them in confusion. He picked up what remained of the metal pipe, seeing the entire pipe now corroded as though it had been submerged in seawater for the last three centuries. 

The insects began to die within seconds of leaving the pipes, their small carcassess dotting the floor with Kyle picking up a few of them, inspecting it. There was nothing too special about the insect, a simple body layout but with clear organs completely missing, such as eyes and a mouth. *What the hell is going on?*

Kyle shook his head, refusing to let his scientific self call it 'magic'. There was no magic in the Galactic Era, only rare exotics. He hunkered down, trying again with another copy of the engraved metal pipe, performing the same actions again. However, the skill did not activate.

Kyle pulled up his System interface again, checking the skill description of his subclass again.

MG404: [Skill | Arcia Disruption (Basic) | *Upwards instead of downwards* | Select one single engraving within five-meter radius to disrupt. Results may vary. Upgradable. Duration: Thirty Seconds. Cooldown: One day.]

*On cooldown... I'll need a light-capturer to accurately flim the results of the skill. Does the flow reverse, or simply start from a different point?* Kyle needed to understand this, as it was a potential issue with any subsequent exosuits that he tried to build. Human nerval impulses were always varying in strength, and if any part of the engraving were to be damaged, Kyle would rather not be covered in insect eggs during a critical battle. 

With the skill on cooldown, Kyle tried to draft up a reverse of the metal pipe's engraving, quickly etching it onto a new pipe to try and replicate the result before.

MG404: [Item | Engraved Metal Pipe (Basic) | A pipe that bends. | Active Skill: Ensnaring - Captures the nearest target, which may be the owner. MP Cost Per Activation: 2 MP. Duration: Thirty Seconds. Cooldown: Two minutes.]

*Huh?* Kyle squinted at the interface message. He activated the new pipe, which immediately began to bend and twist itself, the thickness deteriorating as the pipe elongated itself like an ensnaring vine, wrapping around Kyle's wrist and snaking along his arm, culminating in the tip of the metal pipe splitting apart like a flower. The physical transformation ended as soon as began, the engraving along it clearly broken and deformed. 

Kyle was beyond flabbergasted as he pried the thin metal pipe away from his arm, snapping it into pieces. It was an interesting engraving, but the effect was essentially useless as a weapon. *Maybe as a trap.* Apart from the potential applications, he was far more concerned about the issue that the results were completely different in every way, shape and form. It was not even remotely related, save for a 'physical transformation'. 

*They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results. Yet here I am, getting different results.* As he swept away the pieces into a nice little disposal bin, he contemplated the possibility that the results were different because the starting conditions were different. *This means that my Arcia Disruption skill does not simply reverse - it's more of a random number generator at this point. Hopefully pseudo-random.*

Turning his attention back to the exosuit spine, he wondered on how could he prevent his own engravings from being messed with like this. There was no doubt that there would be devices and contraptions out there that could reverse or mess with his attempted flow of arcia. He could already imagine his internal skill engravings causing insect eggs to be buried deep within his body. 

*Perhaps, the stronger the flow and the finer the control will prevent such incidents from happening.* Kyle would have to implement this for any exosuit project in the future, especially if he intended it to be mass-produced, though there were just far too many obstacles now. 

As he groaned in exasperation, his eyes landed back once again on the vial of Absolute Euria, a flicker of inspiration hitting him as he wondered if he could weaponize it against the Ardent Cretins, his largest obstacle to expansion right now. Maybe Kyle could attempt to drug Sebastian, though he doubt any of his members could get anywhere close. 

Suddenly, his arctech radio buzzed, a panicked Niko hurriedly speaking: [Boss, it's real bad out here!]

"What's wrong? I already made it clear I was not to be disturbed unless it's important."

[It is important! There's a impromptu protest going on right now at Rose Lane!]

"Led by who?"

[I'm not too sure yet, but it seems to be a Crusaders Against Vices or something. They are claiming that the Seven Snakes brutally beheaded a eight-year old kid!]

"Did we? I don't recall ordering recruits to execute children yet."

[What are you even saying, sir? Of course not!]

"I'll be there shortly, ensure nothing gets out of hand."

Kyle rushed out of his personal workshop, entering the crowded Thresher Street, where workers were still clamouring at the glass windows, supposedly captivated by the erotica material displayed on the cabinets, as well as queuing up for light-thrower shows. He was about to ignore their antics when he noticed the mood was unusual, the workers' faces far more solemn and restrained than their usual jubilant selves.

He walked past, taking a peek only to see a handheld light-thrower show running on the store's display of two masked Seven Snakes recruits violently beheading a eight-year old, before chopping up his limbs and tossing them about the house. The throng of workers murmured among each other, locked in heavy discussion.

"It's good that damn Stanley finally died. He evicted me and my grandmother by jacking up the rent. If it were not for the Seven Snakes' housing project, I would still be homeless right now."

"Listen to yourself, you're condoning the brutal murder of a child! He did nothing wrong! Maybe Stanley got what was coming to him, but since when were the Seven Snakes the arbiter of whether a child should be killed or not? In my opinion, no children should be killed at all!"

"Even if they would grow up to be the same?"

"You don't know that for sure!"

"Fuck it! One less rich fucker to deal with! I'm with the Seven Snakes on this one!"

"Disgusting murderhobos! I can't believe I'm working with you!"

"You're the disgusting one, trying to forgive the crimes of the rich. Lick their boots even harder!"

"Speaking about yourself? You're the one sucking up to the Seven Snakes - aren't they rich too?"

Kyle quickly shoved past them to get to the front, the bickering workers instantly clearing a path for him when they recognized him, many immediately scattering, afraid of suffering any potential retribution. 

Before he could enter the shop, a brave factory worker stood in front of him, defiant and outraged at the brutal beheading. "Who are you to kill our children? You think just because you're rich, you can slaughter anyone you want?"

Kyle stopped, glancing around and noticing the crowd slowly inching in, emboldened slightly by the accusation of the defiant worker. "Step away now, if you know whats good for you."

"I may not know what's good for myself, but I stand for the good of us all. We are not your pigs to kill anytime you please!"

A murmur of agreements washed through the crowd like a wave, Kyle seeing the intrusive thoughts already showing on their faces, their eyes glinting with intent. *Intimidation Aura!*

The ensuring arcia pressure blasted the crowd, the defiant worker's face paling as he began to shiver in his murky boots, his fingers fidgeting a bit on his pants as Kyle approached him. 

"The Seven Snakes did not do this, and I will find justice, mark my words. Now return to your work, or else I will have to dock your entire day's wages. Is that clear?"

"Y-y-yes, sir!"

The crowd was dispersed as easily as they were gathered, the fear stemming from Kyle far too overpowering for them to keep any sense of moral superiority. Kyle stormed into the shop, about to blast the shopkeeper for playing such a defamatory light-thrower show when he noticed that the shop door was locked from the inside. 

Retrieving his handgun in one hand and a hammer in the other, he smacked the handle of the door apart, the creaky door opening slowly with not a single soul in sight. He carefully moved through the shop, watching for any potential ambushes while he navigated the rows upon rows of recorded engravings in neatly arranged shelves, indecent drawings of scantily-clad girls and men plastered all over every available surface of the interior. Rows upon rows of erotica books were dropped to the floor in piles, smatters of blood staining their covers. 

As he approached the cashier counter, the familiar stench of a decaying body hit his nose. Kyle did not let down his guard just yet, diligiently checking every corner before he finally knelt next to the shopkeeper's dismembered body. The cuts and wounds seemed to have been done by common kitchen tools, no signs of any arctech weapons or handgun shots either. 

He turned off the light-thrower show at the display cabinet, before realizing that every other store around the area was also playing the same show on repeat, most of the factory workers that passed through Thresher Street having already seen in. "Keith, I need a squad to secure Thresher Street. All of the erotica shopkeepers have been killed. Call up all reserves now, prepare for a doubling of security."

[Understood, sir.]

Kyle headed over to Rose Lane, where a burgeoning protest was now in full swing, led by a enraged lady who stood ontop of an overturned wagon. "THIS OUTRAGE SHALL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED! If the enforcers do not want to enforce the rules of the Sanctum, then the people ourselves shall enforce it!"

Niko and the recruits had already formed a line, preventing the protestors from moving any further. "Shore up that gap, don't let them flank us from the alley! Block it up with the damn crates!" Niko roared, before hurriedly bowing to Kyle. "Sir, there's a light-thrower show that - "

"I know, I saw. Where was it flimed?"

"In the house over there. We have our men securing the place for now."

“Who did it?”

“We don’t know yet, but we’re trying to figure out who.”

Kyle nodded, flourishing his coat as he stepped into the now cordoned-off house. As soon as he entered through the doorway, his body was instantly assaulted by a foul stench, the unmistakable scent of copious amount of blood.

The narrow premises of the house was filled to the brim in gore, and it was hardly possible for Kyle to escape the puddles of blood when stepping in. He originally thought that it would be a simple incident, but what he saw made him think otherwise.

Just inside the living room is the body of a man, hung from the ceiling via two ropes. with his neck thoroughly ripped. His hands and legs had been mutilated thoroughly, the skin stripped off his flesh and left in pieces on the originally white marble floor, now instead soaked in dried dark blood. Brain matter and other tissue flesh was splashed across the once opulent dining room. 

A Seven Snakes armband was left behind, resting on a pool of blood as Kyle gingerly picked it up, inspecting it for authencity. *It's real.* The armband was one that was issued to recruits when they had cleared a month's worth of basic training, something only either a recruit could get, or a Seven Snakes who was high up in the ranks.  *We have a mole.*

Damian and Niko soon entered the house, their faces immediately recoiling from the strong stench of death. The violence was not new to Kyle – he had seen far worse in the Galactic Era, but this level of senseless violence had never been seen before in Raktor. Even Damian, who had been a long stay of the Seven Snakes, was clearly shaken by the obscene brutality of the murders.

"It can't be one of our recruits, they wouldn't dare to do this so blatantly." Damian murmured as he looked at the armband in Kyle's hands. "Unless..."

"Keep the theories till later. Any other clues right now on the scene?" Kyle asked.

"The entire house has been ransacked of all valuables - anything with so much as a gold lining has been stripped." Niko informed.

"Call up all the fences and dealers we know in the black market. I want eyes and ears on anything being sold in major batches, and information on their particulars."

"Understood, I'll talk to them." Damian nodded. "But still, what was the purpose of this? It doesn't make any sense. Are they simply trying to undermine our reputation?"

Kyle looked up to the mutilated Stanley, still hanging from the ceiling. "Someone wants to take us down from the inside. To destroy the trust the people had in us. As for the ultimate purpose... I may have an idea or two."

"But we didn't do it! Can't we just tell them that we did not kill Stanley?" Niko offered.

"Try telling it to them." Damian motioned outside at the protestors shoving as hard as they could against the line of Seven Snakes recruits.

"MURDERERS! Your existence is a sin! Revenge for our fallen brother!" A lady screamed in the face of a recruit as she violently shoved him, the stone in her hand swinging wildly. The edge of the stone drew blood, a long gash striking his face. 

Damian hurriedly rushed out, trying to prevent the recruits from retaliating, while Kyle pondered longer, trying to put the pieces together. He contemplated everything that had happened so far. *First Wrent goes missing, then the enforcers pull out, then this.*

While Kyle thought about the sequence of events, Niko received another call on his arctech radio, his face paling immediately. "Sir, it's getting really bad now. One of our arctech designers has just been found murdered in his house. His entire family was killed, including a one-year old daughter. The show is circulating now as well!"

Kyle stared at Niko blankly, a awkward moment of silence passing as Kyle ran every possible motive through his head. "Sir? What do we do?" Niko asked in a panicked tone, obviously not used to the social unrest that was now spreading like wildfire. 

Instead of Kyle replying Niko, he instead called Adrian. "Update on the enforcers and Wrent."

[Neither of them is moving.]

"Any movement by the Ardent Cretins? The Wretches?"

[None, sir. In fact, just like the Red Lions, they all seem to be pulling back their members from the borders. Something's happening, but I still can't figure out the pattern.]

"Any observers spotted the perpetrators of the murders?"

[No sir, but we do have some light-capturer observation engravings that may offer a few hints.]

"Have them ready for me when I return to the shopping arcade." Kyle ended the call, turning sharply to Niko. "Get every recruit and associate that's in security to be out on the streets now. I want double protection on all designers, as well as the businesses of the Seven Snakes."

"Got it. But what do we do with the protestors?" 

Outside on the street, Damian was contesting with the locals, some of whom he knew personally. "Angela, please, you have to believe us! We did not do it!" He pleaded with the leader of the protest.

"Whether you did it or not, it is clear that your existence is a stain on the security of our districts! How can our children even play in the streets with brutal murderers roaming freely! The Crusaders Against Vices will not tolerate the Seven Snakes any longer!"

"I don't want to hurt you, Angela. Please, stand down and we can talk this out properly."

"Neither do I. But as long as you are part of the Seven Snakes, you are the enemy! Repent now!"

Damian sighed, knowing he would be unable to convince her any longer. Two recruits had to restrained the injured recruit, preventing him from lashing out against the protestors. "Fucking cocksuckers! Why are you holding me back? You going to let this fucking dumb guys shit all over us Seven Snakes! Looks like it was a mistake joining this damn pussy gang when we have to bow down to idiots like them! I don't care if we did it or not, they better back the FUCK OFF!" The injured recruit roared, echoing many of the other recruits' sentiment who felt they had degraded into a powerless security force.

Before Damian could retort, a loud bang rang out through the street, the yelling protestors shocked by the sudden scare. Kyle held a smoking Oriental Bloom in his handgun, aiming it right at the protestors. "You have one minute." Kyle spoke with a firm tone. 

Damian was startled, hurriedly running over to Kyle and whispering. "Boss, what are you doing? If you try to beat them up, it would only raise public resent! Everything we worked for will be undone!"

"Damian. This is not the time to question me." Kyle warned.

 However, Damian was clearly distressed, continuing to whisper: "Yes, but this doesn't seem like the right way to do it!"

"I know exactly what I'm doing. And if you don't want to follow me... I have no use for an underboss who does not comply." Kyle did not need to finish the sentence, Damian getting the underlying implications of what would happen to him if he did not listen to Kyle. He immediately began to organize the recruits, preparing them alongside Niko, though his lingering doubts still swirl in his head as to what Kyle was intending to do.

Some of the protestors began to panic, only to be rallied by Angela once more. "Stay your ground! Even the Seven Snakes gang leader cannot attack his own people, not if he wants to face a revolt! We are stronger together!"

"Suit yourself. Damian, Niko, arrest everyone here. And for those who resist arrest... do what you have to."

# Chapter 80 - Roots

In a sharp reversal of treatment, the Seven Snakes began to clamp down on angry residents and public dissent brutally, beating the protestors into submission with everything on hand. Homes and slums were raided, those who protested being arrested and thrown into poorly maintained cells where they were subjected to continuous torture and experiments, the addiction research still on-going. 

"The districts will now be under a new law. Anyone caught flouting the rules or opposing society at large will be beaten and imprisoned indefinitely. Choose your actions wisely. Security and stability will be restored." Kyle announced through the various media platforms, painting the protestors as the minority. 

Some accepted the excuses, wishing for more security, while others felt constrained. Kyle did not care. The time for playing nice was now over, especially at such a critical juncture just before the demonstration of the knight armour suits to the military. *Almost as if it was on purpose.*

Many of the prisoners were still defiant, planning their escape and trying to earn empathy from the jailors. Yet thanks to the improvement in the training regime for Seven Snakes recruits three weeks ago, they had no qualms about the horrible treatment that the protestors were receiving. In fact, their experience over the course of the month had hardened their views of the rest of the district, treating anyone that was not Seven Snakes lesser than themselves. 

On-top of that, a clarification by Damian on who committed the murder helped to steel and assure the loyal recruits that they were in the right. Many of them who had worked in the job distribution center and elsewhere had first-hand experience of the sheer entitlement of applicants and small petty criminals who refused to join the Seven Snakes.

"Damn straight - finally some action! I'm sick and tired of bending over to these dumb peasants!" The more bloodthirsty among the recruits echoed sentiments of violence and suppression, relishing in the gang's return to its roots.

However, as always , there were recruits who had second thoughts about the entire process and overarching goal that Kyle had in mind, wondering if they were going too far. "We're practically performing illegal experimentation on prisoners!"

Kyle had a simple solution for such individuals: he had them transferred to the Culdao Peaks, rotating the first batch of re-education members around. 

The stint in the training caves worked like a charm, with the returning batch now hardened and seasoned soldiers, ready to act or kill at the drop of the hat. It took a bit of time for them to assimilate back into city life, but Kyle saw the entire program as a rousing success at breaking their spirits and immunizing them to the concept of death, albeit with a bit of trauma.

While the suppression of the protestors initially worked for the first few days, discontentment was starting to spread among the populace, creating strife between those who supported the Seven Snakes and those who opposed them. The ones caught in the middle were starting to lean against the rule of Kyle, mostly due to the oppressive continuous presence of Seven Snakes members watching their every move on the streets.

Yet despite the ability to simply send off dissidents into prison and training caves alike, handling the vipers was a whole another issue to solve. It became painfully obvious to Kyle that not all of the higher ups were in agreement with the nature of his orders.

"Sir, this is unsustainable in the long run. Eventually a large portion of the population will try to break our control. If anything, this resentment could be manipulated by our enemies." Keith protested the orders for violent suppression, with Reese and Eric supporting him. 

"Keith is right, any further antagonism of the populace at large would erode the goodwill that we have worked so hard to build over time. Instead we should focus on explaining the truth and appeasing them.Perhaps we can reach a compromise with-"

"I appreciate your opinions, but it is already far too late."

"But we're being portrayed as the evil ones now. The landowners' association is already protesting to the Sanctum of Yual and Baron Cain for an armed intervention." Keith pressed his case, firmly believing Kyle was heading down the wrong path.

"And are the enforcers responding to their request?"

"...No, sir. No movement at all."

"Good. Spread the word that those who are aligned with us will retain their wealth. Those who resist, have them arrested and their property seized."

"But you will need the Baron's approval first and foremost. All land deeds are issued under his name."

"I will handle the Baron myself, thank you."

"Still-"

"Keith." Kyle interrupted Keith with a stern look. "We are first and foremost a organization that prides itself on being the best, and I will do everything in my power to ensure we remain at the top. There will be no pandering to the weak, no concessions given to the vocal minority. I will not allow anything to disrupt the upcoming mock demonstration nor the sale of weapons. And I did not put you in charge of the businesses to question my orders repeatedly - once is more than enough. Do not think that just because I have shown favor to you in the past, that I will accept any and all opinions. If you do not want to execute the orders, there are plenty of others eager to take your position. Is that clear?" 

"I... yes, understood, boss." Keith accepted it with a resigned look, returning to his work. It's been far too long since Kyle had exerted his authority like this, making the vipers half-forget that Kyle still had the final say in everything that the Seven Snakes did.

"Damian, into my office, now." Kyle ordered, leaving the vipers outside to discuss what had just happened. 

"Kyle must have gone power crazy. What happened to doing right by the people? He was always talking about balancing legal and illegal activites, yet now he's fully toppled over into violence." Keith grumbled. To him, Kyle's actions was erractic and uncharacteristic - rash orders and immediate bouts of violence was not how they had solved issues in the past. 

Inside Kyle's private office, Damian too was conflicted internally. "Sir, I apologize for my brother's actions-"

"I assume you are aligned with him as well?" Kyle interrupted, pulling out two stained Seven Snakes recruit armbands, the same ones they had found at the site of Mr Stanley's execution. 

"There is merit to their concern, after all, the current orders runs counter to our entire business philosophy that we have established in the months since the building of the shopping arcade. Perhaps if you would explain your actions and overarching plans a little it would help to assuage the concerns of the vipers and others."

"These armbands... do you know who issued them?" Kyle seemingly ignored the comment, pointing towards the stained armbands.

"I can have that checked against our logs."

"And who is in charge of our logs?"

"That would be Niko, sir."

"Not him. He's the one doing the distribution to the recruits. These... these armbands were clearly not issued through an official ceremony by him nor you."

Damian's eyes widened at the implications that Kyle was insuinating. "You're saying my brother is invovled in this."

"Perhaps, perhaps not. This is the real reason why I cannot divulge my overarching plans. Do you understand?" Kyle clasped his hands together as he walked closer to Damian. "I tell you this because I have placed my trust in you as the appointed underboss. But do not think for one second that I am tolerant of traitorous activites, no matter how benign the traitor thinks his actions are. Not even the underboss's brother."

"I assure you, sir, Keith has no intention of betraying the Seven Snakes. As his older brother, I can vouch for his-"

"Your words, not his." Kyle pointed out. "Sometimes even brothers have their differences."

Damian wanted to retort, but he knew better than to push the matter even more. "Yes, sir."

"Now, the mole might be anyone else, but it is certainly one high up in the ranks with close ties to the logistics and deployment of manpower across our men. Either that, or your brother is being framed. Regardless of who it is, until we discover the mole, you and I will keep it between us. Under no circumstances are you to explain the situation except with my prior approval. Understood?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. Now, keep the other vipers in line, and keep an eye out for any suspicious activites." Kyle had Damian dismissed, and as soon as the underboss left the private office, Kyle was already going through the motions, checking his drawers and equipment and his possible escape routes. He scanned the rooftops beyond the glass wall of his office, searching for any observers or possible spies that might be watching in on them. 

He methodically searched every nook and cranny of the office, looking for any recording devices or unknown arctech devices. While he had just explained to Damian that he trusted him as the underboss, deep down in his heart, Kyle still did not trust anyone within the Seven Snakes with his life. *Always have an escape route. Even at the cost of your followers.* There was no chance in hell he would subject himself to the same betrayal he experienced at the end of his former life.

With the office now scrubbed clean, and no obvious devices found, Kyle took stock of the scenario. He had a rough idea of what was being achieved, but it will still require more time and observation to truly understand the endgoal and composition of his enemies. *Let's check the observation engravings of the execution site.*

Unfortunately, the observation engravings did not reveal anything of worth, with none of the perpetrators visible in the recording. With no clues and no leads to go on, Kyle had no choice but to order Adrian install as many light-capturers as they could afford in discreet locations, forming a survelliance network, waiting to catch the next event before it even happened. 

An arctech radio call came in from Baron Cain, his voice clearly panicking. [Kyle, what the hell is happening over there? I'm getting flooded in complaints and petitions for your eradication from the South Sector! Did you really kill a landowner's entire family in cold blood? This is crossing the line.] 

Kyle pondered for a second, before finally replying. "The landowners are seeking to rile up the public. They've killed one of their own to blame the Seven Snakes, in an effort to discredit the weapons factory and our growing dominance of the district."

[What are you implying?]

"If we do not control the landowners now, they will attempt to take over our businesses, at which point I will no longer be able to assist with the Aspis Weapons Factory. You will have to manage it yourself."

A poignant silence reigned on the other end of the line, Baron Cain clearly weighing the pros and cons of having Kyle out of the venture entirely, though there was not much to weigh. Without Kyle's input, Baron Cain would never be able to trump the other weaponsmiths as a standalone designing and manufacturing hub for weapons, only to be relegated as contract manufacturers for the foresseable future. 

[No, its critical that you remain with the venture.]

A small grin erupted on Kyle's face, knowing he had steered the Baron to where he exactly wanted him. "Then I will need a temporary approval to execute confiscation of assets should the landowner continue to stir political unrest and dissent among the populace."

[ONLY if they stir political unrest against the current order. Under no circumstances will the approval allow you to simply detain anyone.]

"But of course. Please do add that clause into the approval as well. An announcement should be made as well to clear our name and inform the populace at large of such an agreement."

[.... Indeed, we should. But if I ever find out that you were the ones who truly executed the family, I will see to it that I personally eradicate the Seven Snakes.] Baron Cain threatened before he hung up. 

Kyle leaned back in his chair with a satisified expression, having gotten what he needed. *The Baron is only worried about his public image. The Seven Snakes leaving the weapons factory joint venture and the newly announced housing project would result in a large humiliation city-wide.* While other criminal gangs might have disdained any official deals or compromises with the enforcers or the nobles, it was this very compromises that were now keeping the Seven Snakes in play and in control of its districts.

*With every problem comes an opportunity in disguise.* As the other vipers were tearing their hair out at the seemingly desparate situation, Kyle knew that he had been given the greatest opportunity to solidify his control of the districts. With the landowners all now falling into his hands as soon as they made any attempts at resistance, he could claim and purchase any land deed at market price with Baron Cain's approval once it was confiscated. 

*Now that that is under control, it's time to focus on the weapons contract. With due time, the enemy will reveal themselves through their actions.*

Yet, just as he was about to leave the shopping arcade, he suddenly heard something unexpected on the arctech radios playing in the office, some of the clerks listening attentively. 

[In a shocking turn of events, Versian President Johan has gone missing. The current suspect is Minister Dekar, who is now on the run and has been revealed to be taking bribes from Raktor as a compromise for the previous incident. Vice-President Monero is now temporarily in power, seeking to have elections running as soon as possible.]

["The news of this sudden betrayal by our very own Minister has brought great shame upon our country. It is my duty and honor as the temporary President to ensure that Versia will be able to navigate the uncertain future to come. Our borders and society shall be secured against foreign corruption and aggression, and together, we will build a better, more progressive society on the hard work of our forefathers before us."] Monero's voice crackled in the static, and while the clerks were ambivalent about the event, Kyle's face darkened tremendously. He knew that with Minister Dekar on the run, whatever prior agreement or connection he had with the ruling party of Versia was now cut off. He had half-hoped that the choice would remain open, but he soon snapped out of it, reminding himself that there was always other opportunities to hunt for.

He made his way to the factory, convening with the designers on the final prototype of the knight armor suit. There were twelve copies, sufficient for the demonstration. For the purposes of testing, a few experienced associates and cobras were already there, donning on the prototypes. 

The armour was far lighter than the original steel armour set that the Raktor knights were using, though it was thicker by about a third while boasting an improved penetration resistance. The honeycomb-like structure was neatly hidden away, the metallic surface of the plates yet to be painted in the Baron's noble colors. 

Kyle originally had the concept of engraving the interior of each of the honeycombs, only to realize that was far beyond the capabilities of the factory to mass produce. If the demonstration was a success, the amount of orders will number in the tens of thousands. *Better to keep it simple for now*

Interestingly, the System recognized the entire armour suit as a single item, with the stat bonuses and skills combining.

MG404: [Equipment | Aspis Mk1 Knight Armour (Intermediate) | A mass-produced armour set by the Aspis Weapons Factory in Raktor | +25 VIT, +15 MAX HP. Active Skill: Resist and Intercept(Intermediate) – Temporarily improve resistances by 50% to penetrating attacks, and provides point defence for up to five medium-size projectiles. Duration: Two minutes. MP Cost Per Activation: 15 MP. Cooldown: Thirty Minutes.]

Kyle was surprised to see the skills being able to be combined like this into a single skill, and it seemed to perform more efficiently than if they were separated. He wondered if he could eventually combine all the engravings that he had learnt over the last year into a compound engraving. *Maybe next time.*

For now, he watched as the testers perform basic mobility tests, running up and down in a makeshift obstacle course, as well as testing the flexibility of the limbs. Team B had focused heavily on the freedom of movement, leaving a few gaps between the armour that could be exploited, but the point defence engraving helped to mitigate the number of potential threats, save for a close-range attack. 

A few mock battles ensued over the day, before Kyle was finally convinced that they had a working product, ready for the demonstration. "Have all the suits cleaned up and prepare them for shipment to Baron Cain. Each team's designer will follow me to the demonstration event. Keep an eye out for our competitors - I want a list of potential improvements to be compiled on our return."

@@@

The center of the private proving grounds was filled to the brim with weapons and armour manufacturers from all over the town, the bulk of them in the pocket of Count Leon. Esteemed arctech designers and weapons masters mingled and discussed their latest innovations with each other, though keeping their inner workings close their chest, exchanging frivolous pleasantries.

At the foyer of the private arena was a battalion of Raktor Knights under Count Leon, mobilized to ensure no Versian was able to sneak in. The scar of the Ilysian Punks stealing military secrets still weighed heavily over the city, and only served as a mocking point for other foreign Barons from Kregol and Perlis who came to visit, chaffing at the strict security. 

While the craftsman socialized in the center, on a higher floor of the arena, Baron Cain reclined on a viewing couch, munching on a vine of fresh ripe grapes served by two servants who stood at his beck and call. He was not alone in the VIP viewing gallery, with the other lesser lords of the city and priests of the Sanctum of Yual speaking in soft tones with each other, hashing out deals.

"Baron Cain." A white-robed lady with the insignia of the Sanctum bowed in respect upon approaching his couch, escorted by an inquisitor. 

"Bishop Vernette. Inquisitor Mason." Baron Cain nodded, motioning for them to have a seat next to him. "I hear that your finances have been suffering."

"Indeed it has. The violence has been spilling out over from the West Sector in waves, with almost all of our resources dedicated to stemming the tide of crime." Despite the seemingly large control of the South Sector by the Ardent Cretins, there were still nine districts that were firmly in the Bishop's hand, with no one gang claiming control over them, not even Sebastian. 

"Is that so...? From my perspective, it seems that you are hiding something else."

"If you are referring to the pull back of enforcers from the Seven Snakes district, need I remind you that we have also pulled our enforcers from the Red Lions and the Wretches's zones of control as well. We only have so many men at our beck and call, and their lives are of the utmost importance to me."

"More than enforcing the Sanctum's law? I fund half of your current budget." 

"And the other half is funded by me." A stranger interrupted the conversation, prompting the Baron to turn around. 

"Bishop Flectus. How nice of you to join in my private conversation. Perhaps you could provide a more reasonable explanation as to why the enforcers are not doing their jobs."

"They are doing exactly what they should be doing - not cooperating with the vile gangs, unlike a few individuals here." Bishop Flectus sneered in response, his white-robed arms crossed in an elegant manner. "The Sanctum of Yual should not tolerate those who run afoul of the holy commandments. Those who listen are inherently worth more than others."

Baron Cain did not reply, merely nodding nonchalantly, knowing that it was just an excuse. Bishop Flectus smiled and began to approach him, intending to sit on the same viewing couch only for the Baron's servants to block his path. "Who are you two to stop me? I am a Bishop of the Central Sector!"

"And I am a Baron and they are my loyal servants, not some bragging dog who doesn't know where to sit. Know your place and leave us." Baron Cain waved his hand dismissively, no longer paying attention to the simmering Bishop. 

"Now, now, now, that is no way to treat each other! We are all working for the same common goal here!" A boisterious voice echoed from afar, Baron Cain knowing exactly who the owner of the voice was. 

Immediately the entirety of the viewing gallery paused what they were doing, bowing towards Count Leon who were now entering with his appointed generals, five of whom flanked him from behind in an entourage. Count Leon bore a wide grin, unnervingly ecstatic as he reached out to Bishop Flectus, slinging his arms around his shoulder and patting playfully. "Two arms of the same driven purpose - to make Raktor the city of dreams! No need for such abrupt confrontation! Let us all be a better man and put aside our disputes for today."

"As you wish, Count Leon." Bishop Flectus bowed again, shooting a scathing glare at Baron Cain as he was heralded by Count Leon away to another section of the viewing gallery, far from prying eyes and ears. Baron Cain scoffed at the arrogant display, turning to warn Bishop Vernette: "I know what you're doing - you're trying to play both sides. Neither Kyle nor I will forget this betrayal."

" Can you really call it a betrayal when I have not intervened at all? As a Bishop, I do what I must to protect my people." Bishop Vernette hardly wavered from the accusation. "The inner politics are not the concern of the Sanctum of Yual."

"So be it. Those who sit on the fence will eventually be ruptured from within, or brought to heel." Baron Cain did not press the issue any longer, his attention now drawn to the center of the private arena below him that was now clearing out, preparing for the demonstration of arms. A few servants issued pamphlets containing the agenda for the day's proceedings, the Baron noting that the requisite testing of arms were much more stringent and rigorous than ever before.

A lord who owned a weapon crafting workshop seemed to share the same sentiment, exclaiming out loud with shock to his peers. "The criteria is too harsh - no armour suit nor weapon can survive such a beating!"

"Perhaps it is only yours that is unable to survive. Your armour is not known for its tenacity, after all. It is right to be worried." A taunt came from elsewhere, causing the surrounding lords to chuckle at the expense of the enraged lord. 

"Who slanders me in broad daylight? Show yourself if you dare!" The furious lord stormed towards the source of the voice, only to instantly backpedal and hurriedly bow in return the moment he recognized the source.

"Here I am. I am the one who slandered you. Now what would you have me do?"

"My apologize, Baron Namor! I did not know it was you!" The lord apologised frantically, half-expecting a punishment for acting so outwardly towards a Baron of all people.

Unexpectedly, Baron Namor shrugged it off, treating the slight as a non-issue. "If you would like to not receive such taunts in the future, consider improving the quality of your products. Look how unbothered the others are, full of confidence in themselves to clear the bar set by the Count. War and technology is ever developing, and one must strive to stay ahead of the curve and not rest on one's titles. I myself have the utmost assurance in the durability of my East Sector's offerings, and so do the other Barons. Isn't that right, Baron Cain?" 

Baron Cain could feel the underlying tones. "Of course, Baron Namor. We do our best to strive for the betterment of our armed forces." Despite his outward confidence, the list of tests detailed in the pamphlet shocked him. He had only seen a few simple tests at the Aspis Weapons Factory, and was unsure if Kyle's armour set and rifle would be up to the task. The clear confidence from the East Sector's Baron Namor alarmed him slightly.

*Endurance, Durability and Penetration will be tested to the brink.* Baron Cain glanced around at the murmuring lords as well as the other Barons, flipping the pamphlet pages over. Only a total of twelve corporations had registered to vie for the demonstration - three coming from the Barons of Raktor, one from the county of Kregol and Perlis each, and seven owned by other lords and businessmen who had close ties with the Count. 

On the other side of the viewing gallery, the members of the registered corporations were gathered, splitting the 'common folk' away from the nobility. Despite the overtly friendly atmosphere shared by the craftsman, each of them clearly recognised the other as rivals. It was especially apparent in the distinction between Sectors, Kyle being the only corporation from the South Sector applying for the demonstration.

Kyle flipped the pamphlet over, his brows furrowing at the various tests placed. It was far different from what Baron Cain had informed him, but thanks to his prior preparations, he was more than confident that the tests would pose no issue at all. The only factor that he could not control was the competency of Baron Cain's knights, who would be the ones donning the Aspis MK1 armour for the mock battle, assuming his armour survived the tests. 

*With Baron Cain in full sight of the tests, I doubt that anyone would try to cheat openly.* Kyle was certain that instead of cheating on the tests, the corporations affiliated with Count Leon had already known about these tests beforehand, allowing them to tailor the perfect armour to meet the criteria. It was certainly an effective way to filter out those who were underprepared.

Next to him on the viewing couch, Gordon and Buron sat down, both of them clearly excited about the upcoming tests. If it were not for the presence of Kyle, they may have spilled the beans about their innovations and progress with the armour to anyone who might ask, constituting a information leak of sorts. 

Buron almost left his seat, unable to control the urge to speak to one of the other craftsman that he had been eavesdropping on, only for a firm hand to hold him down. He looked up to see a stern Sasha, as silent as ever, her glare treating Buron like a rebellious kid that could be killed at the drop of the hat. Whatever thoughts he had of running off and interacting with other designers faded away in an instant. 

Kyle had Sasha return from the Culdao Peaks to bolster security in the district. After all, the unrest was occurring in the city, not in the goblin kingdom, where Merissa, Feldon, Gulak and King Sahusa had everything under control. Sasha herself drew a few quick glances from others around the viewing gallery, most of them never having seen her before in the Seven Snakes. 

"Ah, Mr. Kyle. I am surprised to see you here of all places. Don't you have a riot to control?" A taunt wafted in from the side.

Kyle glanced sideways, only to break out into a smile. "Why, if it isn't Master Foolish, Dull and Witless together as a trio. If I haven't seen one of you lurking outside the erotic shops of Thresher Street, I would have thought all of you were conjoined at the waist."

"My name is -"

"I hardly care what your name is. Perhaps you should keep such unwanted information to yourself."

"You fucking brat, you don't know who you're messing with! Sooner or later, the riot will grow beyond your control."

Kyle raised his eyebrows. "Careful, Master Witless. Such predictions would lead some to believe that you might be the culprits behind the unrest."

"The Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths firmly rejects and denounces the brutal execution of the family by unknown men. That is, if the Baron's announcement is to be believed in the first place." Master Witless smirked.

"I will be sure to let the Baron of the South Sector know that there are men who do not believe a noble's words." Kyle waved his hand dismissvely, leaving the three masters stunned and furious. Master Witless tried to step forward, but was summarily blocked by a fearsome Sasha, who glared at them.

"Those scrooges are persistent, they might be behind the rioting and execution." Gordon whispered to Kyle. "We should have them investigated."

"Of course. But for now, worry about what's in front of us than about theories. I'll handle them."

From the corner of Kyle's eyes, he could spot the East Sector's corporations congregating together in a corner of the gallery. In the midst of them was a heavily tattooed man wearing nothing but a sleeveless shirt and shorts. It was a Tul'e Da'li ranking officer, who sneered back at Kyle. "A minor gang from the South Sector trying to swim in the big leagues. How ridiculous! Sebastian must be losing his touch."

Kyle ignored the obvious taunt, his focus on the arena that was now setting up for the first test. 

"Look at him, thinking he's the cock of the town with his shiny fake gold cloak. That suit looks like it came off a slum dweller, hah!" The Tul'e Da'li ranking officer taunted from afar, drawing the laughter of the associates that gathered around him. "Acting like some bigshot, tough guy. You're just a bag of hot air."

Sasha nearly started, her hands about to draw a blade strapped to her body when Kyle held up his hand, ordering her to stop. "Actions speak louder than words. We do not need more enemies."

"Yea, that's right. Keep your bitch reigned it like a good little dog. You're lucky we ain't in the South, because we would have decimated you! HAHAHA!" 

Kyle brushed off the never-ending series of taunts, unwilling to fight. There was no reason to start a ruckus, especially when he had a military contract to win. Beating up the Tul'e Da'li officer was simple enough, it was the consequences that made it untenable. It was already painful enough to deal with the Ardent Cretins - getting onto another major gang's hit list was not something Kyle wanted now. 

[We shall now begin the demonstration test! Participants will now undergo tests under various scenarios - failing the tests in any stage means you shall not be moving on! Only a complete knight armour set with a rifle will be accepted as the product to be tested!] An announcer called out through the arctech speakers, his voice booming through the small enclosed private arena. Apart from the two viewing galleries, the normal seats were filled up with other journeymen and masters from the Weapon's Guild of Raktor, each of them looking for inspiration or the latest technology development in Raktor.

"Bet the runt won't even make it past the first stage, hah!" The Tul'e Da'li continued mocking Kyle incessantly, causing a vein to pulse on Kyle's temples. 

Not wanting a fight did not mean Kyle was about to let him go off scot-free. He twirled a small vial of Absolute Euria into Sasha's hand discreetly, his Designate Follower skill activating. [Make sure you're not seen.]

[Understood. Full dose?]

[Half dose. I'm a generous man - he can repent for the rest of his life. If he survives.]

# Chapter 81 - Military Demonstrations

The tests were about to begin, with the generals discussing over who they thought would come out ahead as they inspected various samples of the registered armour pieces, noting any deficiencies.

"Of course Baron Namor's Fulcan Defense provides the most protection for our knights as always. I hear this time round, they have made great strides in innovations and improvements to the original base design that we have long been accustomed too." One of the generals pointed out on the material composition sheet, a complusory document that each participating corporation had to issue. 

"Perhaps, but I see the Dimas Uniform by Master Huron being potentially able to overcome the challenges. Our knights should be far more mobile than ever - not walking metal coffins. With rifles and cannons dominating the battlefield, perhaps the best option is extreme mobility."

"I don't mind which armour wins - only the one that has the best cost-to-performance ratio. Our budget is more well spent on procuring more cannons and arctech weaponry than focusing on the knight corps. They are a dying breed in the modern world." Another general chimed in.

"Or perhaps we may very well find a way to integrate all three of them into the army." Count Leon smiled genially, as though he was hardly worried about the outcome, his eyes momentarily meeting that of Baron Cain's, who stared back at him with obvious suspicion.

As the various armour sets were lined up on the arena, Kyle got a good look at all of them, before leaning back and extending his palm out to Gordon, prompting Gordon to quickly place a half-read arctech textbook in his hand. Kyle never wasted time, directing all his efforts to to the betterment of himself and his followers at all costs.

The Tul'E Da'li officer scoffed at the seemingly arrogant posture of Kyle reading the textbook. "Slumrat is about to find out he's in way over his head. Nobody can beat our Fulcan Defense!"

The first test began on schedule, with a few Raktor recruits moving forward, using a standard military-issued knife to stab the armour in anyway possible. A loud crack and fracture could be heard as one of the private corporations' armour broke apart at the seams, the knife's edge easily cutting apart the main breastplate, clearly showing the deficiencies in refining and hardening of the original metal. 

Any employee related to the corporation immediately hid their face in shame, unwilling to be recoginzed by the other members of the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths, lest they be ostracized from the industry. On the flip side, their boss was unrepentant: "We aim for the lowest cost possible. At least the armour can block a single knife blow! With our cheap armour you could make every recruit a knight!"

"I too can block a knife blow with my teeth. If I wanted shoddily-made armour I would have bought them from Versia! Leave us!" A military general scoffed, immediately evicting the corporation out of the demonstration. 

The second test was a antique handgun, used in the two Yual-Hwa wars. It had a very low muzzle velocity, only suitable for target shooting instead of penetration. Nobody really expected any of the armour to fail these part, until the next armour's helmet had a conspicuous gaping hole perforated completely by the weak pellet, the owner of the corporation in question flabbergasted. "How is this possible? We've tested it multiple times! Someone must have sabotaged us!"

The cries of protests fell on deaf ears as the corporation was escorted out of the arena, their reputation tanking amongst the master craftsmen of the Society. On the far end of the viewing gallery, a few of the other owners grinned, clearly involved in the sabotage. 

"Get down there and make sure everything is well." Kyle ordered Gordon, wary that a sabotage could happen to them as well. There were far too many enemies in the demonstration, everyone vying to be the only recognized armour set to earn the military funding.

The third test was a standard rifle, the current issue that all Raktor soldiers utilized in battles. It was here that many of the armour sets failed to make the cut, many getting shredded easily like cheese or paper as the three iron or lead pellets tore through them at a medium velocity. Three of the private corporations were knocked out by the second pellet, large portions of the armour already fracturing apart like a puzzle, the sharp jagged edges of the wound glistening in the spotlight.

The final test was a repeater rifle, the same version that the Ilysian Punks had been stealing from the military. The repeated strikes pushed the armour sets to the limited, the weaker armour sets reaching their failure points easily.

Throughout all the tests, only three armour sets stood standing by the end, the viewing gallery now conspicuously empty, leaving only the Tul'E Da'Li officer and his associates, Kyle with Sasha, and the craftsmen under Master Huron. The taunts no longer came in, everyone there now finally recognizing the competence of Kyle's armour set.

One of the military generals personally inspected the surviving pieces, marvelling at the Aspis MK1, the surface now riddled with pellet dents, some of the iron and lead pellets having been flattened. "Incredible. Almost no backplate deformation after all of this?! How much does the armor set cost? It must be the most expensive of the remaining eight." He asked his aide-de-camp, who trailed behind him.

"Sire, the Aspis is actually the lowest in terms of cost. The total set costs only thirty thousand rakels when rounded up."

"Ridiculous. A proper armor should be about a hundred thousand rakels. There must be a downside to this armor that we just do not know yet. However, a thirty thousand armor set will mean that we might be able to recruit more knights than we currently have."

The aide-de-camp nodded, but leaned in with a low whisper. "Sire, if we choose such an armor set, we may incur the ire of Count Leon and his suppliers that have worked with us for a long time."

"Nonsense! If Count Leon wants a competent army, only the best armor should be selected! That is, if the Aspis MK1 survives till the end."

A bead of sweat broke out on the forehead of the aide-de-camp as he glanced nervously between the general and the Count glaring down at them from the viewing gallery. He hurriedly ran over to another armor, trying to embellish the others. "Sire, the Fulcan Armor by Baron Namor is also proving its worth. It might be a bit more expensive, but it may perform better than expected."

"Hmm..." The general sauntered over, looking at the damaged breastplate, noticing that the backplate protrusion were not significant, yet still more severe than what was visible on the Aspis MK1. "Perhaps. I will consider it."

The Aspis MK1 and the Fulcan Armour making it to the end was a given, but Kyle was surprised that Master Huron's armour set had survived. He had been under the impression that he had to only contest with the prevailing military supplier in the form of Baron Namor.

Amdist the audience, the masters of the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths hardly bore any friendly expressions. "How is it possible that a bratty upstart like the Aspis is able to go toe to toe with our representative Huron?!" Master Dull grumbled.

"He must have cheated - but it is of no matter. The mock battle will reveal the flaws immediately and that arrogant Kyle will find his downfall swift."

[With the last three armour sets surviving to the very end, we will now commence a three-way mock combat between knight squads.]

The arena was hurriedly arranged by servants, utilizing arctech lifters to hoist heavy stone pillars and debris, mocking a standard warzone of about 400 meters diameter in a circular fashion. Makeshift towers and random broken crates were thrown into the mix, creating a chaotic landscape. 

A few of the servants were a bit too trigger happy with the cannons, blasting apart the smooth floor of the arena to create ditches.

Kyle watched as a squad of Baron Namor's knights stepped forward, their Fulcan armour covering them from head to toe in quenched and tempered steel, the metal glistening under the arctech spotlights with the colors of the Baron plastered over them. The helmet had been shaped to resemble that of a cavalier, imposing a regal authority upon those who saw it. The engravings spoke of strength and instaneous power, an armor designed to burst through any form of resistance they met on the battlefield.

On the other side, a small motley crew of mercenaries wore a hastily arranged Dimas Armour set, some of whom had to reuse the damaged armour from before. It was far lighter than its counterparts, resembling a medium leather armour with interspersed steel plates, aiming at maximum mobility. Exposed skin were visible on the thighs and biceps, sparking a heated discussion between opposing philosophies on what an armour should be. 

"It seems Master Huron has maximized the freedom of movement on the Dimas Armour according to his teachings." Another master from the Society noted, his accompanying journeymen and apprentices nodding quickly, jotting down the lessons. "The essence of combat is being faster than the enemy, always two steps ahead."

"Are you talking for yourself, or are you merely regurgitating words from long-gone masters?" Another master retorted. "Baron Namor clearly has the advantage here. Even mobility cannot outrun overpowering strength!"

"All the Dimas Armour has to do is to outpace the slow Fulcan Armour, and it would be an easy win!"

"All the Fulcan Armour has to do is smash the Dimas in direct combat! Skulking around does not work in an head-on confrontation!"

The heated discussion began to escalate into a few direct arguments, long time personal disputes being brought into fray as tensions rose, their stance ever more rigid from the two armour having proven their tenacity through the various tests beforehand. 

"Its clear that the Fulcan Armour is the superior one in real combat, but the Dimas Armour is a good concept as well." The Tul'e Da'li officer remarked with surprising lack of bias and maturity. "At least it is much better than the shitty Aspis MK1, made by a nobody!" He chortled as he picked up a cocktail glass, siping on it before noticing a weird taste on the tip of his tongue. Instead of complaining about it and potentially revealing his own ignorance, he drank it promptly, unwilling to be taunted. 

Kyle didn't care too much about the officer ingesting the Absolute Euria - his life or eventual death was of no meaning to him after all. Instead, he waited quietly for his armour to appear in the arena.

Soon, Baron Cain's knights entered the arena, though the reception was more muted than the other two. Baron Namor had the support of a major gang, and Master Huron had most of the Weapon's Guild supporting him. Baron Cain instead only had Kyle, a relatively unknown leader of a minor gang at best. 

"This is going to be fun. I can't wait to see the look on Count Leon's face." Inquisitor Mason grinned as he whispered to Bishop Vernette.

"An inquisitor should be far above such petty things."

"Says the one looking at Bishop Flectus's direction for a bit too long."

The Aspis MK1 was not particularly shiny, the surface matte with an interesting color pattern that matched the arena itself. It did not blend in at all, the human figure still clearly visible, but it took extra effort to discern them from the random debris and cover around them.

It seemed to be a middleground between the two armour presented so far, having very obvious gaps in its armour. The shape of the armour was practical, not glamorous or exquisite in anyway, giving off a rugged feel. However, the Aspis boasted a significant volume of armour on the main body parts, the volume being even higher than the Fulcan. This led to a sort of oblique shape that looked clunky, even though the knights had good freedom of movement.

The sight earned a rousing chuckle from the audience. "Now that I finally see someone wearing it on, I can tell that the armour has lost its purpose! It is always a tradeoff between strength and speed, not trying to achieve both and obviously failing." Many of the Weapons Guild craftsman agreed, murmuring their discontentment. Part of their hatred to the Aspis MK1 was due to the lack of employment of guild journeymen and apprentices, hence the boycott. 

Other masters began to weigh the three armours against each other properly, seeing the squads gearing up and getting into position. "Armour is not the only determinant of whose set is better. The compatibility with the rifle is paramount to a soldier's survival. I cannot envision the Fulcan Armour having too much leeway in repositioning and accurac- by Yual, what is that?"

A wave of shock erupted in the audience as the Fulcan Armour knights revealed their rifles, which was now strapped with an unusual bayonet design that looked more like a sequence of gears with sharp teeth. Thick engraving lines ran along the dense metallic center, the barrel of the rifle dwarfed by the sheer size. 

"The grinder is our breakthrough innovation to combat an ever-changing battlefield. In the previous conflicts, barbed wire and fortified defenses were the main obstacles for the advancing knights - which will no longer be the case with the grinder."

Bayonets and attached pikes were not new for rifles, but it was a first for anyone in Raktor to see such a weird contraption being shown as part of the main offering. It definitely showed prowess and brute strength, something that could invigorate the troops in a frontal assault. The sharp teeth could also grind through armour easily if necessary - but only if the knights got close enough to the fortifications.

"This is bad for Master Huron. If the Fulcan Armour knights encircle them, they would have nothing left to defend themselves with!"

Some turned to Master Huron in the viewing gallery, expecting a defeated expression. Instead, he bore a wide grin on his face, as though he had already expected such an outcome.

Yet, despite his confidence, the firearm on the side of the Dimas Armour did not evoke any confidence at all. It looked very much like a standard antiquated arctech pistol used very often in the skirmishes of the past, with nothing fancy nor innovative about it.

Instead, the Aspis MK1 had a far more unique design, unlike anything the others have seen before. Contrary to the standard rifle design, instead of having a single pellet canister on the top and an arctech fuel pack strapped to the butt, the rifle featured four canisters on the top, angled slightly away from the barrel to allow the pellets to slope inwards. It also did not have a fuel pack, instead boasting a connection port at the side for an external fuel pack mounted by the armour itself on a well hidden back compartment.

"Four canisters?! HAH!" The Tul'e Da'li officer burst out laughing, his associates following suit. "A knight can barely fire more than five pellets a minute even with a repeater - four canisters is a ridiculous overkill. Might as well paint a target on your helmet so the enemy knows exactly where you are!"

Conversely, Baron Namor had stopped smiling, already knowing the reason for the four canisters from earlier internal tests. 

[The mock battle will begin in one minute. Any man who is knocked down is protected. Any man who suffers an injury is protected. No headshots and no intent to kill! Count Leon and the military generals reserves the right to stop the fight at anytime.]

Down at the arena, the three opposing knight squads began to form up opposite each other, randomly assigned their starting positions. The deul began in earnest, with the squads immediately moving. Baron Namor's squad rushed forward, intent on striking down the Aspis MK1 squad. The Dimas squad had the same idea, working together to pincer attack the Aspis MK1.

"As much as I do not like the phliosophy behind the armour, is it not a bit unfair to have two squads gang up on one?" One of the masters remarked, slightly wincing at the Aspis MK1 squad slowly being cornered as the first pellets began to fly. 

As if they were already expecting it, the Aspis MK1 squad began to entrench themselves behind the cover, taking up defensive positions with good viewpoints on both approaching squads from across the arena. Despite their clear line of sight, the Aspis MK1 did not fire at all, making many observers confused. "Are they holding on because their rifles do not have the range?"

This emboldened Baron Namor's squad, who charged forward unrelentless, leaning into the strengths of their armour. No cover or debris were a match for them as they made a straight beeline right for the huddled Aspis MK1 squad. The leading knight used the grinder at the tip of his rifle like a spear, carving a direct path through the mess of wooden boxes and even stone walls, showcasing its offensive capabilities. 

As soon as the leading knight broke through one of the cover positions with two of his comrades in close formation, he rushed the nearest Aspis MK1 knight with the grinder front and center, intending to impale the armour. Instead, he found himself facing the barrel of the four canister rifle, the connecting arcia fuel pipe gurgling with full pressure, engravings along the length brimming with energy. 

The leading knight hurriedly activated the inbuilt point defense engraving, expecting only three or four pellets to emerge. Instead, a hailstorm like never before seen blasted outwards from the rifle in rapid fire, the pellets in the mounted canisters being consumed at a rapid rate while the barrage mowed down the three knights in quick succession with green point-defense arcia bolts flying harmlessly. The withering fire annihilated the Fulcan Defense steel, denting it and sending the remaining Baron Namor's knights scrambling for cover themselves.

Unfortunately, the leading knight took the brunt of the damage, bleeding from multiple new orificies that had torn through the front of his armour like butter. It was near impossible for him to move without getting sliced or jabbed by the jagged edges of the holes, the backplate deformation of the impact crushing his flesh uncomfortably as he hit the ground with a loud thud, the first casualty of the duel.

Baron Namor sat upright in his chair, no longer resting on his laurels as he glared at the seemingly infinite pellet capacity of the rifle. Everyone was caught off-guard, some now fully understanding why the rifle had four canisters of pellets instead of one. "By Yual, it's an improved repeater!"

The Dimas squad did not prove any better. With minimal armour on, they had even less protection from the pellet storm than the Fulcan Defense. One of the more daring mercenaries activated his boots, increasing his footwork as he tried to close the distance towards the entrenched Aspis MK1 squad, but was instantly suppressed from all angles, intermittent fire from the squad pinning him down well enough. 

The two attacking squads were not dumb - if they could not wrest control of the defensive position, they would rather hold their own line against the Aspis MK1 squad without risking too much in an all out attack. Instead, they began to look towards each other, wondering if they could at least claim second place. 

However, they never had the choice, as the Aspis MK1 squad split into two, both parts rushing out to attack. "Now's our chance! Get them!" The mercernary leader grinned, charging out with two pistols, firing with abandon. The pellets hardly made a dent on the honeycomb structure of the armor plates, each individual ceramic element reducing the ballistic impact greatly, allowing the Aspis MK1 armour to shrug it off.

Soon, the duel turned into a one-sided massacre, as the wounded began to accumulate on the arena, all of whom were not Aspis MK1 armour. The only time the armour showed some form of weakness was when one of the grinders hit the armour, tearing it apart easily. Yet with the withering barrage and immense firepower, most of the grinders could not get close. 

"I've seen enough. Stop the duel." Count Leon raised his hand. "Generals, please make your decision."

The generals look at each other in apprehension, with only one of them being far happier than the others. "Of course, the cheapest and best armour, which is clearly the Aspis MK1. In fact, I would go so far as to suggest delaying the military exercise to allow for our troops to properly incorporate this armour into our ranks. We would have a clear edge over the Versians or even the Hwa Dynasty!"

"But we have already stores of the earlier version of the Fulcan Defense. It would be simpler to replace and upgrade in sections rather than to buy a full armour set from scratch. Consider the switching costs as well." Another general countered, his eyes glancing a bit to the flustered Baron Namor, who seemed ready to go down to the arena himself and inspect the damage to his knights.

"If we want to increase our ranks, we would have to purchase more armour regardless - I'm sure our recruits would perform much better with an reduced version of the Aspis MK1!"

The generals continued to bicker while Baron Cain felt like he was on cloud nine. Any lingering subconsicous apprehension he had about working together with Kyle were now washed away like snow on a summer's day. He had half-regretted making the announcment to clear the Seven Snakes name as well as making the temporary approval, but as of now, he couldn't care less about giving Kyle anything he needed so long as his own personal public image was improved. *Kyle is truly the future - I must work with him for as long as possible.*

At the other viewing gallery, Kyle promptly stood up, about to leave with Sasha without saying a word to the other two participating corporations, the Tul'e Da'li officer left flabbergasted at the result, his face completely awestruck before he hurriedly composed himself together, his business orientated mind already seeing the potential value of collaboration. 

However, the moment he tried to approach Kyle, Sasha was already between the two of them, blocking his path, but he still gave it his best shot, calling out after Kyle: "Good sir, would you be interested in potentially meeting my boss? We could arrange for a potential acquisition of your factory - the compensation benefits would be significant, on the order of millions."

Kyle gave a sly smirk to the man, not stopping in the slightest."I am always open to negotiations, and we can meet at a later date."

"Of course, my boss will be in contact soon!" The officer bowed respectfully, but Kyle barely gave him any further attention, leaving the gallery, having never intended to meet the Tul'e Da'li. 

After all, there was no use negotiating with a dead man.
# Chapter 82 - The Union

"Count Leon has agreed to make a purchase order of a preliminary 30,000 sets of the full armour set, along with 60,000 of the reduced cheaper version in total. This order is far larger than those in the past." Baron Cain summarized the conclusion of the demonstration, handing over an order sheet over to Kyle. "150 million rakels, paid on delivery of the armour sets after inspection."

The amount of money was more than enough to cover operations of the Seven Snakes for the next three years even with the exorbitant salary he was paying the designers, reliving a burden off Kyle's shoulders. It was good, but the money was still not in their hands just yet. Producing the armour would take time. "What's the deadline?"

"Two months. They are already delaying the military exercise, but it can't be shifted any later than that. Kregol and Perlis are involved in the joint exercise drill as well, so any later would cause issues."

Kyle's expression immediately darkened, Baron Cain catching on to the obvious signs. "You can't produce that fast enough."

"Not at the current rate, no. I'll figure it out, and I'll have it done by the two months." Kyle wasn't about to let go of such a juicy contract, but he had this inkling that the order should not have been this large in the first place. "How did Count Leon behave during the negotiations? Any signs or erratic issues?"

"Surprisingly enthuasitic overall. Seemed to have no qualms issuing us the contract, even convincing the generals to order more than three times the original discussed amount."

"Hmm..." Kyle took that information with him, returning back to the Aspis Weapons Factory where the managers and Gordon were gathering and already celebrating the results of the duel. The revelation of the order from Kyle had mixed reactions from them at best, many worrying about it. 

"Sure, it took us a month to design and produce twenty sets of the Aspis MK1. The bulk of the time was in the design and research, so now we should be able to go faster." Buron was optimistic, but he was just the designer, which means he had minimal interactions with the plights of the average production team technician. 

Gordon was more wary of the tall order. "But how fast can we go? Say we did not even include the reduced version, and only produced the 30,000 Aspis MK1, we would have to produce at least around 4000 each week."

"Whats the current expected maximum production rate for each assembly line?" Kyle asked.

"Takes about an hour to complete one set, with the rifle, not including the testing and quality check." Gordon calculated. "And I have yet to factor in the amount of material needed. We might not have enough mined."

"Don't worry about the materials, I will source for it if necessary. But judging based on the rate, we must have the assembly lines working 24 hours a day. Do we have enough workers to man all twenty of them?"

"Not yet, sir. The part-time trade school students and the associates are not experienced enough to work full time on the assembly line just yet, so in terms of just experienced workers, we're at 50% capacity."

"Then we'll have to work them 50% harder. Double everyone's shifts and get more workers in."

A moment of silence languished among the managers, even Buron, as Kyle eyed them warily. "Speak your minds."

Gordon took a deep breath, steeling himself. "Sir, with the new martial law and policing by the Seven Snakes... there's been a bit of a bad look for us. If we double the workers' hours, there very well might be backlash and growing dissent in the district that could come to bite us back in the ass."

"If we don't double the workers' hours, we won't be able to match the ..." Kyle's voice trailed off, as something in his mind suddenly clicked together. Everything was beginning to fall into place like clockwork, the machinations of those who were plotting against him becoming clear as day, a small grin appearing on his face. "I see what's happening now."

"See what?"

"My order still stands." Kyle held his ground, his body language far more confident now. "Double the workers' shift until we find enough workers to man the factory at 100% capacity, but do not double the wages. We have to control the cost until we receive the payment. Explain this to all the workers, have it reinforced during the morning speeches. Don't forget our roots, Gordon. We are a gang, not a charity. Sacrifices have to be made."

Gordon nodded, albeit a bit reluctantly. Kyle did not waste any more time with them, calling Damian and Sasha to meet over at one of the Seven Snakes' various smaller bases, masking his movement as best as he could. 

"The enemy has finally reared his head. It is even more critical that the vipers follow my orders to the letter. Any deviations from this plan will result in unwanted consequences that threatens to further erode us as a gang." Kyle explained quickly. 

"But are we allowed to know what they are trying to aim for?" Damian tried to dig in, but Kyle stood firm.

"Not until we find the mole. While I trust the two of you, it remains to be seen if information is leaking through either of you. I will have to keep the nature of our orders to myself."

"Sir, you can trust us, we would never leak the information."

"Thank you, Damian." Kyle replied with emotion, not taking the show of loyalty to heart. Betrayals always come from the most trusted of followers. "Now, I need you to disseminate the orders accordingly."

"Damian, I need the associates well trained. No quarter nor mercy is to be given to anyone who flout our rules or try to disrupt us. Every burgeoning protest is to be cracked down on immediately. I will not tolerate any unrest or disruptions to the factory's production over the next two months. This order applies to both you and Niko. All prisoners are to be withheld indefinitely for any infractions, even the smallest."

Kyle continued speaking, rattling off orders as Damian jotted down the information. "Have Keith inform Merissa and Feldon to speed up material production. Have the prisoners enslaved and working on preparing the materials for the armour set. All of our efforts should be directed towards the completion of the contract. And I still want any resistant landowners properties taken away. Yes, even Stanley's prior possessions."

"Sasha, I need you to trail the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths. Find out which pub they gather at, who is the landlord who host their weekly meetings. Their council, treasurer and every man of note should be profiled and jotted down onto a record here for my perusual."

"Lastly, get Adrian to watch out for any movement. I want eyes and ears all over the district, anything that even sounds remotely suspicious comes to me immediately. This includes the other vipers."

Both Damian and Sasha wore a grim face at the idea of stalking their own members, yet Kyle hardly cared. "Remember, we are not the people's friends, nor are we their saviors. We only do things that benefit us. And no matter what order I give you, it is all for the future of the Seven Snakes. Is that clear?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. Get to work. Because once we're done with this, we'll be on track to be the next major gang in the South Sector."

@@@

"The mutilation of Stanley must be punished! How are the enforcers simply letting the Seven Snakes go off scott-free?! Who is enforcing the law?" A landlord yelled at the top of the lungs as he slammed the shiny wooden laminate of his conference table, the copious amounts of newspaper cutouts slightly trembling from the force. 

"Yea, and now the Seven Snakes are the enforcers? How did they get Baron Cain on their side? Even the Ardent Cretins are not this blatant! This cannot stand!" Another enraged landlord added, a wave of vigorous agreement spreading through the meeting. "How dare they try to intimidate us into selling our property. Stanley's properties are now in the hands of Kyle himself! We should have rioted when he was still building the shopping arcade."

"We should have rioted when he just ousted the Ilysian Punks! A dog of Yual will never understand Versians." Yet another landlord chimed in. Many of them there were originally from Versia, having migrated to the district because of the presence of the Ilysian Punks, creating its own closed feedback loop of Versian solidarity in the sea of various ethnicities and nationalities in Raktor.

As the meeting continued, many grievances were exchanged before the meeting was interrupted by the doors slamming open, revealing a far shabbier group of factory workers mixed with a few craftsman, clearly from the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths. Master Dull led the entourage, but some of the landlords looked at the outfit of the incoming group with clear disgust: "What? Who let your kind in? What nonsense is this?"

The two groups stared at each other, having came to blows before over raises in wages and work hours in the past. They immediately saw each other as enemies, especially Master Dull who had long resented the landowners for their lazy and greedy attitude.

"Who the hell are you? This was our group's arranged meeting point." Master Dull began with his usual rash demeanour before gargling a glob of saliva and spitting it onto the luxurious carpet without a care in the world. "Have you not learnt your lesson from our previous picketlines?"

"We should be teaching you your place, you dirty rats! Always looking for the easy way out!"

"I could say the same for you scummy landlords, idling and collecting profit at the expense of others' labours. What benefit do you bring the workshops and factories?!"

Before the two groups could come to blow, their confusion only further amplified as a third group showed up, the Versians among the groups immediately recognizing them. 

The third group was comprised of hooded individuals, ten of whom wore non-descript robes, their faces also equally flabbergasted as Master Dull tried to make sense of the situation. "What in the world is going on? Who invited any of you here?"

"I suspect we might have been all invited here by the same individual." The landlords association leader's better judgement reigned supreme, trying to diffuse the situation. "It seems that we may have common ground, the Seven Snakes." Tensions began to relax a little, as they began to realize there was a purpose that they were all gathered here today. 

"The fucking invaders who ousted our brothers!" Master Dull cursed, taking a seat at the other side of the conference table, revealing his true allegiance apart from the Society. "And transformed our district into something unrecognizable. Now, we're filled to the brim with migrants and tourists all clamouring from a job who won't even hire our accredited craftsmen! I got a good mind to give Kyle a thorough whacking if I can get close enough to him!"

"What good would such a whacking do? Someone new would simply take over and continue running the factory for profit! If even the dumbest resident can make a rifle, your Society is practically useless." Another landlord scoffed, clearly incensed from his past dealings with similar organizations.. "I don't blame the Seven Snakes for getting rid of your kind - I know you fixed the market prices far too high!"

Instead of Master Dull answering, a hot-headed craftsmen shouted back: "Them fighting words, coming from a fat pudgy landlord who regularly raises rents without even improving anything! Maybe I should whack you first and handle this myself! At least I won't have to compromise with your greedy fuckface!" 

"The Goddess herself has already claimed dominion over us. We are all equal - it is only through true equality that we will understand each other." The third leader tried to intervene, only to earn a flung glass at him. 

"I migrated from Versia exactly to avoid your kind. I had enough paying out of my fucking nose for unemployed losers like you despite me having worked my ass off!" A landlord roared, with some of the Society's members surprisingly agreeing with them. 

"We are working towards a better united future while you are worrying about your own disproportionate wealth? What human needs seven servants and three buildings, hmm? You should be purged from society, a tumor on the health of humanity!"

"How about I purge both of you instead?!"The tensions rose again as chairs were tossed aside, the various members going toe to toe and scuffling with each other, grabbing collars and tossing anything they could get their hands on. 

In the midst of the fight, none of the scuffling members noticed a new attendee flanked by two others, the well-suited man walking in with purpose and taking a seat at the head of the table despite the chaos erupting around him. His fingers rasped against the table loudly, drawing the attention of the others over the loud crashes and fights. 

"Fucking hell, another one? Is Gunther fucking with me?!" Master Dull groaned as he shoved a half pummeled landlord to the ground. 

"I am Gunther. Pleasure to meet all of you." The man at the head of the table smiled, his fingers rasping like clockwork, repetitive every second until those in the room began to calm down, staring at him. 

"Then I guess you better start explaining what fucking stunt you're trying to pull by putting us here in the first place."

"Mr Sutton has already enlightened you. We have common ground. A common enemy that is worth putting aside all of our differences to fight against. If you follow my rules, we can have the Seven Snakes reeling in a month, or even less."

A wave of mirthless laughter erupted across the room, even the infuriated landlords. "In a month? I only accepted the invitations because I had hope this 'Gunther' would be someone reasonable. How are you going to take down the Seven Snakes in just a month?" Master Dull scoffed. "Industrial action would be on the order of months or even years of picketlines, strikes and protests!"

Master Dull soon found Gunther expressionless, the mysterious man's face completely serious. "My word, you really believe in your plan."

"I would only explain it to those who swear to silence. You have thirty seconds to leave, otherwise you will be consider complicit." Gunther leaned back into the leather chair, relaxing. 

The members exchanged nervous glances, but none of the three groups backed off, especially not the landlords who were hungry for revenge for the death of their own. 

"The plan is simple. The entire economy of the Seven Snakes now hinges on the weapons factory. We simply need to make sure that the factory is immobilized, and then we can bring Seven Snakes to the bargaining table, rip them to shreds."

"And how would we do that?"

"Rudimentary actions. The Seven Snakes have already fallen into the trap. The martial law and new restrictions will be our source of motivation, our source of anger to find more people who will align to our course. Just like how I found your three groups."

The leaders sat quietly for a moment as they contemplated the plan, only for the silence to be broken by the boisterious Master Dull. "But why are you in charge? All of this sounds great and all, but they are just fluff - you can't actually pull them off without our help. Seems like you're gunning to be the new big guy amongst us. Why should the Society help you? I might as well go it alone."

"You can try." Gunther gave a knowing look, though he barely moved, only leaning forward to clasp his hands together, resting his chin on them.

"Then you can forget about having my support. And here I thought the plan would be something special. The Society has their own ways of dealing with reluctant factory owners, and I'm sure as hell ain't going to work with fat pigs and crazy cultists." Master Dull rose from his chair. "While I'll like to see Kyle gets what he deserves, this is far too much of a compromise. We're leaving, boys."

Gunther snapped his fingers, Master Dull suddenly feeling a sharp jab in his neck, a syringe lodged deep in his neck with purplish fluid pressed into his veins by his own members, his eyes widening in realization. He tried to open his mouth, but his jaw was locked as the tendrils snaked across his cheeks, rooting his muscles in place, not even being able to blink. 

He could only watch Gunther smirking at him from the head of the conference table. "You don't even have control of your men. What makes you think I really need you? Now, would anyone else like to leave?"

The remaining leaders shuddered in their seats, no one moving an inch as Gunther began to pace the room, inspecting the various members. "Good. Let's keep in this way. My rules are simple. You're either with me, or against me. I don't compromise. I don't give second chances. For a revolutionary movement's entire being should be devoured by one purpose, one thought, and one passion. To win. Do you understand? If you don't, I'll make sure you do. Now, onto our next step."

Gunther returned to the head of the conference table. "We need to rile the people up. The factory's hours are going to be doubled, but wages aren't going up. The Soceity, you will begin to organize the dissatisfied workers. Build up the numbers, prepare for a mass strike. But that alone is not enough. We need more impetus, more momentum, more outrage."

"Mr Stanley's death is outrage enough." Mr Sutton, the leader of the landlord union spoke up. "We can try to paint him as a martyr to the people, get people angry."

Sutton's words only caused Gunther to break out into uncontrollable laughter. "What's so funny?"

"A single greedy landlord being a martyr? I did not take you to be a comedian, Mr Sutton. An entirely  ridiculous proposition." Gunther's retort clearly incensed Sutton, but he did not fight back, having seen what was still happening to the craft union leader. 

"We need another strike, another event. And our dear Master Dull had just volunteered himself. Have him prepared." Gunther motioned his hand towards the immobilized craft union leader, two of Gunther's followers walking forward to hoist the leader up onto the table, before setting up a light-capturer and placing Seven Snakes armbands on, dressing up as a recruit. 

The sheer methodical operation alarmed Sutton. "You.... you're the one who killed Mr Stanley! Not the Seven Snakes!"

"Ah, does it really matter? Mr Stanley was a dead man walking either way. In fact, I would go so far to say that I've rescued him from suffering in the clutches of the Seven Snakes."

"You're insane!" Another landlord roared in defiance, standing up and protesting. "You think we would follow your orders now that we're seeing this? You will be exposed for your deeds."

"And the Seven Snakes rule the district once more. Which would you prefer? What am I even saying? I'm sorry for making it sound like you have a choice." Gunther smiled, the landlords immediately being surrounded by Gunther's men, all of whom who had been posing as Society members, cornering and restraining the landlords. "But rejoice! For Mr Sutton was right after all. All of you can become martyrs for the cause."

Sutton panicked as the syringe was forced towards his neck, struggling against his captors from behind as he shouted frantically. "Please, no! I'll give you anything, I'll give you my wealth for funding, for support! You need money to strike, to feed the workers! I can give you jewels, paintings, everything! Just let me go!"

"You seem to not understand. I don't live for greed or for wealth. This... sick world, this digusting social order, the so-called civilized world that is cursed with avarice and inequality: I have severed every link with it. The laws, the morality, the mannerism hardly matter to me. I am the merciless enemy of all that is 'right' and for me to continue to live in such a world - I only have one purpose" Gunther murmured as he retrieved an ornate knife, walking up to the craft union leader. As Gunther slid the blade underneath the chin of the craft union leader, the leader barely reacted, his body stiffened by the poison but clearly still aware, the fright visible in his eyes. 

"To destroy it."

# Chapter 83 - A Worker's Life

*Two weeks later...*

The ringing bells echoed through the Seven Snakes District as the first light peeked over the smog-filled tips of the buildings, the bright rays reflecting off the tall housing complex apartments where hundreds of sleep-deprived workers were stirring awake. 

"Culo, wake up, wake up! If you're late you're going to lose your damn job." A pair of hands shook the bed violently, the sleeping man tossing and turning under the thin blanket before jolting awake. 

"...wha?" Culo grumbled as he rubbed his groggy eyes, trying to get a good look at the arctech clock, ticking away quietly at the ceiling of his shared dormitory room. "Five in the morning?"

"Get up, else I'm gonna leave without you!" His roommate gave him a hearty slap on the back, before rushing to queue up for the smaller communal bathhouse that had now been situated on every floor of the apartment building. 

"Just... just a few more minutes." Culo lay back down, his eyelids barely budging open as he could feel the fatigue accumulating in his bones, his mind already dreading the working days to come. As he stretched his limbs, trying to release the strain, his hand rubbed against a ragged piece of paper, featuring a painted portrait of his brother and his village back in Ocra.

That painting alone galvanized him, realizing what he had came to Raktor for. *Nothing comes without sacrifice.* Culo repeated the mantra in his head, forcing himself up and towards the bathhouse beneath the winding halls of the housing complex to have a simple wash of his face and hair. As he joined the queue, the workers barely talked to each other, retaining their strength for the long workday ahead as they shuffled in silence, each taking turns to rinse themselves clean.

Soon, he was out onto the street like clockwork, joining a throng of workers that shambled in a slowly burgeoning crowd, all of whom were heading towards three sharp chimneys that jutted out of the city akin to a spine, the Aspis Weapons Factory looming ominously over its counterparts. 

No one spoke a single word to each other, the initial joy that had infected the workers in the first month now long lost. Many kept their mouth shuts, focused far more on the time than the crowd around them. Culo himself had already lost track of his roommate, becoming just another face in the sea of factory workers. 

The hissing of arctech wagons unloading workers from other districts, the continuous chime of ladies waking up other workers living in their own houses alongside the kids who trailed behind with trays filled with breakfast meals melded into the background as Culo marched incessantly, his brain hardly functioning. Even as he walked past Thresher Street, the sight of the pornographic displays and erotica only drew a short glance from him, before he mindlessly made his way towards the factory. 

Soon, he was one of hundreds queuing up in the factory for the routine security check, the aggressive handling of the Seven Snakes recruits manhandling their belongings and clothes. "Five minutes till the next shift!" A foreman called out with a loudhailer, the workers picking up speed a little as they shuffled to and fro. Culo moved to his locker in the changing room, swapping out his clothes for a standard overalls uniform with the number 384, buttoning it up only to wince at his raw fingers that were still healing from burns. 

As he closed his locker, the workers from the current shift began to enter the changing room, Culo recognizing one of them, a fellow Versian migrant from Ocra as well, though not his village. He tried to get his attention, but his friend barely acknowledged his surroundings, acting like a mindless drone as he simply went through the motions. It pricked Culo's heart a little at how much has been lost, but he brushed it off, focusing on what he came here to do. 

"Shift starting in a minute! If you're late, you lose one hour of wages every minute!" Another manager hollered, spurring the workers on into a sort of frenzy as everyone broke out into a slight jog, heading towards their assembly line stations and forming up with the rest of their production team, Culo following suit. Culo was surprisingly one of the few adults in the team, the youngest of the team being only twelve years old. Children were far cheaper in terms of wages compared to adults, so Culo could count his lucky stars.

"Welcome back, boys. Here's to a more productive day. Yesterday we fell behind on our production goals of twenty-four sets, so we'll have to make up for the shortfall." The foreman's speech elicit a few groans from the workers, but no one dared to speak out, not with the Seven Snakes associates patrolling the factory armed with the improved repeaters. 

"Last shift we had three rejected vambraces, five rejected sabatons and two rejected rifles. Those workers have been relegated to the steel moulding station. If you don't want to get assigned there, I suggest you all do get better at etching, and etch faster!" The foreman continue berating the production team, pointing out their errors and their flaws. "I can't afford anyone to make anymore mistakes, else all of us get the chop, you hear? There are hundreds waiting at the job distribution center for your very position now!"

The shift began in earnest, Culo taking his place along the assembly line as he grabbed the arcia etcher dangling from above his station, turning the embedded dial up to increase the temperature of the tip, ready to get to work. Already the sweltering heat was starting to get to him over the next few minutes, the sweat clinging to his skin and uniform as his back was drenched, working tirelessly in a never-ending chain of production, a single cog in the machine doing the same thing on repeat. 

"416! You're late by ten minutes!" The foreman's voice carried over to him over the din of machinery, but Culo did not dare to turn around and look. "You'll be docked accordingly!"

"Sir, please, there was a hold-up on my wagon. Another body turned up again - it's one of the Masters of the Societ-"

"I don't give a shit who got executed this time round. Baron Cain made it clear that these are the acts of terrorists and should not affect you. The simple fact is you turn on time, or you won't be paid! Now get to your position or you can be blacklisted for life!"

*Thank the heavens I was on time.* As the next vambrace was passed to him, he placed and clamped the guiding sample over the vambrace, hurriedly stuffing the etcher's tip into the various groove and carving away as fast as he could, before applying a binding agent to settle the etching in. Giving a quick cursory look, he handed it off to the next person, who sanded the edges and the bulbous layers left over by the etching and binding agent, smoothing it down. The following station's workers fixed temporary arcia terminals on it, running a test flow through it to see if the engravings worked as expected. Once they were done with the simple test, a layer of protective coating was applied before being tossed into a reflow oven, the coating naturally equalizing over the various grooves and notches of the etching to provide a continuous surface.

Each worker continued on tirelessly - vambraces, gauntlets, cuirass, helmet, greaves, boots, rifles and pauldrons were moulded, refined, etched, sanded, smoothen, layered and then re-etched again, followed by a quality check. 

With twenty members in the production team, Culo was one of the ten engravers, while the others had to face the brunt of the factory's heat in the steel pressing and moulding machine. Other teams tempered and heat-treated the steel before the production team got their hands on it, creating a fully in-house vertical economy where every material was within reach of each other.

The soot and grime from the factory began to accumulate on their faces, as the toxic fumes from the arcia etching fluid and high temperature outgassing of the steel made their way into Culo's bloodstream, though he did not understand how it truly affected him. All he knew was that he could feel his body slowly dying, having chalked it up to continuous lack of sleep. 

Moving through the routine, Culo etched piece after piece, changing out the guiding samples regularly and checking, his mind completely hollow save for his hands moving automatically on instinct, drilled into him over the last month and a half. The other workers were the same, no one even exchanging a single glance at each other, nor did they have the energy to spare. Culo could see a few of his team members taking the downtime between pieces to get some shuteye, dozing off immediately the moment they closed their eyes. 

Culo tried to do that, but he was not as adept as the others. As he tried to sneak in a quick nap, he was suddenly rudely awaked by a gauntlet smacking him right in the face, the foreman's angry face glaring right at him. "384! Get your shit together! You didn't apply enough of the binding agent for the etching to work on this part of the damn gauntlet, and here you are sleeping on the fucking job! If you want to sleep, I can swap you out with someone else who's more willing!"

"No sir, please, I need the job, I'm sorry! I'll fix it right now." Culo hurriedly grabbed the gauntlet, his hands flustered as he grabbed the wrong guiding sample, almost etching in the wrong traces before the foreman stopped him. 

"You fucking idiot, you-" The foreman's rage was interrupted by the clanging of the lunch bell, the large factory arctech clock that controlled the lives of the worker hanging overhead booming with a resounding chime. "I'll deal with you after this - this better be your last fuckup!"

Culo apologized feverishly as the production team shuffled off, handing over their positions to a part-time team made up of the trade-school students. Their starry-eyed and relaxed demeanor only reminded the workers of how badly they were suffering right now, the mood only worsening as they headed to the factory's messhouse, queuing up for their mandatory meal.

Culo had his head hung low, ashamed of the mistake as he queued up. His depression was interrupted by a worker shouting at the top of his lungs near the front of the queue. "What?! I got to pay for this now? Shit, this used to be part of the free meal!"

"I don't make the calls, honey." The lunchlady gritted her teeth. "If you got a problem, take it up with the management."

"Fuck you, just give me a scoop of that damn soup -  since when do we have to pay for soup?"

"Since you boys aren't making enough money, I guess. NOW MOVE ALONG, YOU'RE HOLDING EVERYONE ELSE UP!" The lunch lady motioned with a dripping ladle, some of it splashing onto the shouting worker.

The shouting worker turned to face the others in line, noticing that some were clearly angry at him for holding up the queue. "You guys really going to pay for soup? When we're working 16 hours a day, being paid only for eight hours? This is bullshit!"

"Still more than what we get outside!" A worker retorted. 

"But at what cost?!"

The quarrel continued for a few more minutes, some of the workers murmuring in agreement, while others yelled back, telling the worker to move aside. A scuffle broke out between them, prompting the Seven Snakes guards assigned to the factory to immediately charge in and arrest the original complaining worker, hauling him off to an unknown fate. 

Culo heaved a sigh of relief that the queue was moving along again, checking the time on the clock again. *20 minutes left. I can eat in ten, and then I'll catch a nap for five-* 

It was only now that the irony of his reaction began to hit him. *How low have I sunk that I can easily succumb to the whims of the factory? When was I this obsessed with time?*

As he glanced around the queue, each worker was also nervously looking at the clock, hoping that they had enough time left to finish their lunch. Some even boasted their own pocket-watches, checking them regularly to make sure they were completely on-time, fearful of being accused by the foremen. He watched as the workers who already had their meal gobbled down the cheap radish stews and mashed potatoes hurriedly, their eyes continuously glancing at the clock to see if they could afford a quick ten minute nap. 

Culo felt out of place, as if he was an observer of a dystopian nightmare. Regret began to well up in him, as he wondered why did he even leave his village in the first place. He had succumb to the rumors of good standard of living and good food in the city, as well as the wages being far higher than whatever he and his brother was earning. Yet the life was far easier and simpler back home - he used to only work a few hours a day, and that was only during the harvest seasons. 

Now? He was clocking in sixteen hours a day, non-stop, everyday of the week. Culo tried to convince himself that it was only temporary, just like the factory managers said. But he had this sinking feeling that it was going to be quite permanent, the feeling only intensifying when the food portion he received from the lunch lady was clearly smaller than the week before, the factory skimping out on ingredients.

Culo shuffled over to an empty seat, shovelling the tasteless grub into his mouth without caring about the taste. As he chewed, swallowed, chewed, swallowed, he wondered to himself just how did things become like this for him. He no longer found joy in food, nor did he find joy in his life. He could barely see the meal in front of him as anything other than just something to provide energy for him, a far cry from the succulent wild meat from tusken rabbits that he and his brother used to savour in the cold winter together. *What the hell am I doing here?*

"Hey, you alright? This free for me to sit?"

The sudden call broke Culo out of his stupor, seeing another unfamiliar worker pointing towards the empty bench opposite him. "Err, yea, of course."

"Alright. You sure you're fine? Saw you staring at the meal for a while now."

*Has it been that long?* Culo glanced at the clock, noticing he had been eating for ten minutes, with only another ten minutes left. "I'm fine, sorry. I'll make a move first, gonna try to catch some sleep first."

"Hey, hey, hey, no need to rush off. I know that look on your face. You don't like what's happening around here, don't you?"

Culo glanced around nervously, wondering if this was a trap of some sort, evoking a laugh from the other worker. "I'm not out to make you lose your job. You know, you're not the only one to feel this way. Others do too."

"Others do too?" Culo had this impression he was the only one, especially judging from the expressions of his fellow team members. 

"Of course, its just that nobody dares to step out of line, lest they end up like that guy. Everyone wants to keep their jobs, right?"

"Yea... I guess so." Culo kept a low profile, making sure none of the Seven Snakes guards else was listening. "If you step out of line, you get grabbed like that complaining worker did. The Seven Snakes are far too brutal - they execute everyone that goes against them!"

"I know. They killed a Master of the Society of Friendly Weaponsmiths , and most of the landowners too, all for their own benefit. It really makes you wonder, are you really getting paid your fair share from all the money they are making?"

"Hold on, hold on," Another worker nearby interjected, clearly invested in the topic. "They already said they didn't do it - it was someone else trying to frame them. I heard Baron Cain's announcement way back-"

"Come on, how naive can you be?" The unfamiliar worker groaned. "Tell me, who benefits the most from the master dying? Who benefitted from the landlords dying? It's the Seven Snakes! They have all the motive in the world to do so. With the Society inept as ever, no one dares to organize against the Seven Snakes, and they bought all the confiscated land deeds up at market price with the Baron's blessing. Ridiculous, if you ask me, to think that people could believe their lies so easily."

"The Society was useless to begin with - they only look out for their own, not dumb factory workers like us. The last time I tried to join, they just laughed at me and called me unskilled. Told me to wait twelve years." The other worker retorted. 

"Still, the Seven Snakes are benefitting the most. Look at how they got us all lined up like compliant sheep, ready to burn our lives away for the numbers on their papers to simply increase another digit."

"What are you trying to get at?" Culo interrupted. "We can't do anything, we got no power."

The unfamiliar worker grinned, but soon began to speak faster as he spotted a Seven Snakes guard looking at his direction. "Like I said, you two, you're not the only ones dissatisfied. If you want things to change, come find me after your shifts just outside the gate." He left as abruptly as he joined, grabbing his meal tray and moving to another seat. 

Culo and the other worker traded a few glances, before returning to their meal. The bell rang again once more, the factory clock dictating his life yet again. He stuffed what was left of the meal and hurriedly returned to the assembly line, avoiding the glare of his foreman and focusing on making sure he didn't cause another mistake. 

The hours flew by, but Culo felt like he had worked for an eternity, staring at the same spot in the same posture, the etcher having already became a part of him, the continuous clanging of machines a part of his life, drowning out his thoughts. He briefly entertained the thought of meeting the unfamiliar worker, but he quickly brushed it off, not wanting to risk anything for the wages he was earning. 

Despite the physical and mental suffering that he was experiencing now, the money was still benefitting his home village to some degree at least. Whats more, the job was the only reason why he had a free dormitory to stay in, reducing his total cost of living. If he were to be evicted, then he would either have to rent or return home defeated. 

With that settled, Culo toughened himself out, gearing himself for a productive sprint when a loud shout bellowed from the front of the assembly line. "The machine is down! The machine is down!" 

The steel press machine was now malfunctioning, sparks erupting from the errant engravings that seemed to have cause a few gears to have jammed up, preventing the metal press from lowering or moving up. One of the workers tried to reach his hand in, attempting to dislodge the gears, but his hand was far too big. Production team members began to clamour around the machine , wondering if their pay would get docked because of the sudden disruption. The foreman himself was panicking, calling up everyone he could think of to try and solve the issue as quickly as possible.

Soon, the solution came in the form of small children, two girls who were barely eight years old, but they were paid well thanks to their small size and nimble fingers, able to weave through the tiny gaps that an adult couldn't and fix the machines. Culo relaxed a little, knowing that the kids were good at fixing machines, a well-known staple of the factories around the city. The rest of the members returned to their stations as well, about to take advantage of the failure to sleep when suddenly a blood-curdling scream erupted from the same spot.

When Culo turned to look, the most heart-rending shriek engraved itself into his mind as he saw the originally tiny scrawny body of the girl dragged into the merciless gears, the sound of her arm and shoulder snapping asunder while the steel press moved on its pre-defined motion. The foreman stared helplessly as the machinery twisted her around, drawing the skin and flesh tighter and tighter into the gears, her limbs flailing widely whilst the blood splattered and streamed upon the floor, the oozing fluid snaking its way to Culo's feet. 

While the rest of Culo's team stayed rooted, he was the only one who rushed out of his chair, attempting to throw a nearby curiass into the metal press in a bid to lodge the machine right into its gear. The freshly produced curiass was crushed, prompting him to toss in another sabaton before anyone on the team could react. The amount of steel finally jammed the steel press, Culo hurriedly reaching over to save the girl. "What are the rest of you doing? Help me!"

The members immediately got to work, extracting the mangled twisted arm of the girl, her shoulder entirely broken into fragments that were protruding from every angle, her head lulling out lifelessly as blood continued to gush out of the open wounds. "Get a healing potion, quick! Someone must have one!" Culo glanced around frantically for a solution as he laid the girl on the floor, but another small hand grabbed his shoulder. 

He turned to see the other young girl, who shook her head sadly while pointing at her partner. Culo looked down to see that the girl was clearly already dead, her face locked in excruiating pain and anguish. He placed the body down gently, still shocked from the horrifying accident while the girl's partner began to wrap the bloody body arm with the help of the others. It was then he noticed that the girl's partner herself was missing a finger or two on both her hands, with one of them still wrapped up, the muscles and skin stripped to the bone from fixing other machinery. 

As if on cue, the large factory arctech clock boomed without emotion, signalling the end of the shift. Unlike the other workers who immediately left, he was rooted to the spot, watching the others carry off the lifeless body of the girl, the girl's partner almost treating this like it was a daily occurrence. 

It wasn't the first time it had happen in the weapons' factory, but Culo had just never seen it happen on his assembly line, his mind trying to make sense of it all. Instead, he earn a slap to the back of the head, the foreman angrily berating him. "Look at what you've done to the damn gears! It's going to take an entire day to fix this! You can forget about coming in until it's done, and your wages will be docked until you pay off the damages!"

The foreman's rage infuriated Culo beyond belief, his eyes nearly clouded with anger. Still, Culo held his tongue, not speaking a word as he gather his things and left for the changing room. Instead of his usual tired self at the end of every shift, he now slammed the locker door with fury unbeknownst even to himself, changing and hurriedly moving out of the factory, hoping to find the unfamiliar worker outside. 

He did not see him, his hopes plummeting tremedously. *This is hell. The managers are inhumane. The workers are mindless. And the owners are oppressing us!* As he walked through Thresher Street, moving along with the returning workers, he saw a few workers clearly diverting off the usual path back to the housing complex, some of them turning into an alleyway. Catching onto the clue, he picked up the pace, hurriedly turning the corner and seeing their figures disappearing into a basement staircase, secretly tucked away behind a pile of trash. 

Culo gingerly stepped forward towards the staircase, instead coming face to face with the unfamiliar worker coming out from behind the pile of trash, seemingly having placed something inside. Before Culo could question what the worker was doing, the worker grinned instead and warmly greeted him, distracting him. "Comrade, I knew you would come. Come in, everyone else is waiting for you." 

As the two of them entered, the alleyway returned to its usual lonely atmosphere, only punctuated by the girl's partner walking alone towards the same staircase. She rummaged through the trash, looking over her shoulder to make sure nobody spotted her. Her hands felt for a familiar touch, before gripping onto a wad of rakels that had clearly just been placed recently, tucking it away in her shabby dress while she strolled off, whistling into the cold wind. 
# Chapter 84 - Mindtwister

*In the Culdao Peaks...*

Kyle dug his hand into the soil, feeling the damp moist texture on his skin. "The soil is performing quite well with the new irrigation. How soon can we start producing Poair Leaves?"

"We've already ran a few test on variants, so we can move forward with the best one. One of the plantations is already blooming now, so we'll have the final harvest in a week's time." Merissa replied, handing him a clipboard with the information.

"I need more. Much more. What about the other farms?"

"We now are growing five varieties. So far, the new radish seeds are performing the fastest, it would take another month or two to see results."

"Hmm..." Kyle continued to inspect the farms, especially the Poair Leaves plantation. Poair Leaves was a critical ingredient in his potion-making business. Now that the Aspis Weapons Factory was running at full steam, the Seven Snakes were essentially burning money. Adding on the cost of expansion in order to create more jobs for people, Kyle was quite near the brink of bankruptcy in the next two months.

"How's the factory coming along?"

"The new one here? We're making it an exact duplicate, but the goblins are much harder to train than the humans by a large margin." Feldon frowned. "We should have it going in two weeks, but its going to take sometime to ramp it up. I'll say it would be nowhere near the capacity of the one in Raktor, but it should make up for a shortfall."

"If you need stronger goblins, have King Sahusa bring them to the Oracle Chamber for evolution."

"It's not about strength, it's about dexterity and understanding. Now, if you told me there was a chamber to improve their intelligence, that would be right up our alley." Feldon complained.

Kyle was not putting all his eggs into a single basket to meet the weapons contract, relying on slave goblin labour to shore up the defecit if any. It wouldn't reach the same efficiency as the Aspis Weapon Factory in Raktor, but based on his estimates, he should be able to produce at least 30% of the required weapons within a month and a half in the Culdao Peaks itself just based on current progress. 

He would have preferred to have a larger safety net over a longer period, but the timing of the military exercise and war was his deadline - if he wanted the best benefits, he needed to do this. *Every problem is just an opportunity waiting to be turned.*

As such, Kyle was now gunning for alternative avenues to increase his revenue streams as much as possible. With the goblin kingdom now turning to mining, manufacturing and agriculture, he was confident that he could monetize it even more than it already was. In some sense, the Culdao Peaks were effectively free labor now, due to the ability for them to remain self-sufficient. However, they were not making any money other than the sale of Euria Seeds that were harvested. 

"Sir, we could simply just sell more Euria Seeds?" Feldon offered his opinion as they continued their inspection of the various terrace farms which stretched all along the valley. "Now that we have a wider area of control over the mountains and forests, we could expand our harvesting operations."

"No. Oversupplying the market will only cut into our profits by tanking the price even more." Kyle also knew that other gangs across the city were beginning to develop their own Euria Seeds plantations, especially thanks to the developments on Euria-infused potions. The concept of addictive potions were already widespread in Raktor, so Kyle needed something new to continuously dominate the market for drugs within the South Sector.

*People are always searching for the next high, so it may be time to move forward.* He had a good knowledge on what chemicals would be addictive, even considering if he could plant opium seeds from the Galactic Era seed storage in the Oracle Chambers as a start. However, such a chemical with an unknown production method not native to this planets would raise serious alarms. He had no way of knowing who was actually out there watching him, so his developmental steps had to be measured at best. 

This meant that Kyle needed to focus on developing a potion that was already known locally. Haui had given him a few ideas, but he was focused on one that was one of the first he had encountered, but had not used yet.

MG404: [Title | Potion Inspector (Intermediate) | *It seems that you are somewhat of a scientist yourself. | +10 INT, Increased description of potions examined.*]

MG404: [Item | Mind-Bending Potion (Advanced) | *Sends the user on an illusionary trip fueled by their subconscious, rendering them incapable of normal functions. Lasts up to a day on a full dose.* | *Recommended Dosage: Half a bottle for an adult human male for three days. Ingredients: Poair Leaves, Greiss Powder, Culdao Grass, Tusken Rabbit Meat, ???. Cooldown: Thirty Seconds.]*

The title now allowed him to see the ingredients, most of which he previously did not have access to. Now, with the goblin kingdom under his control, both the Culdao Grass and the Tusken Rabbit meat were freely available to him in the wild just by foraging and hunting with the goblin hunters. The Poair Leaves could be grown easily, and Greiss Powder could be simply purchased off the market as a ubiquitous product.

Furthermore, there was still a hidden ingredient that would require him to either level up his Potion Crafter title or his Potion Inspector title. The issue with that was that the progress between titles was exponential. Kyle in fact had been crafting potions non-stops, attempting to obtain a new title over the last two weeks but to no avail. 

*When I first started, the titles came in freely. Now, each one only comes in a blue moon.* Thankfully, with Haui on his side, Kyle was able to obtain the name of the last ingredient easily: Dzi Flower Sand.

"Such an ingredient is extremely rare. It can only be found in a mountainous area, and most of the time it is stuck either in the mud or in the water. It would take extreme filtration to extract any meaningful amount. I myself am not privy to the exact extraction method." Haui warned Kyle as he passed him a sample of ingredient, which looked like a dazzling rainbow color bag of translucent sand. "Even the Alchemist Guild does not have a stable method of production nor does every mountain range have it."

What Haui did not know was that Kyle had access to a Galactic Era A.I in the form of the Oracle, who was designed for planting seeds. As such, samples of the mountain soil and water around the Culdao Peaks were collected, Kyle letting the A.I process the samples and perform a chemical analysis on them. 

[140 samples processed. Only 5 have the presence matching the chemical compound known colloquially as Dzi Flower Sand. However, the concentration is small.]

A representation of the chemical compound was presented to him. "You have chemical simulations built in?"

[Yes, Adminstrator.]

"Run oxidation and bonding simulations with all elements on the periodic table."

[Confirmed. It would take five days to complete, with an accuracy of 66.7%]

Kyle begrudingly accepted the slow processing speed of the A.I, considering that he had yet to actually make any repairs to it at all. Five days was a long time, however, and Kyle wondered if there was perhaps local information available. He decided to go out to the goblin kingdom for any clues if the locals were familiar with the Dzi Flower Sand, accompanied by Sasha as he showed the sample that he had obtained from Haui around, starting first with King Sahusa. 

"I have never seen that before." King Sahusa stated bluntly. "Though I have heard rumors before of the Snow Song Tribe performing brilliant rituals during the period of festivities, their stone beaches on the glacier lakes filled to the brim with colorful sand just like this. If you need a guide, I can provide it."

Kyle accepted the offer, immediately trekking up out of the valley towards the peak, following the new river that the goblin workers had carved out by hand to irrigate the terrace farms, siphoning water from the ice melt far above. The trek was relatively easy and harmless, the path between the Snow Song Tribe and the domain of King Sahusa well-trodden and clear-cut. 

The wind rustled the myriad of ferns and palm trees that surrounded them, the humidity copious despite the mountainous terrain due to the abundance of water all around that evaporated under the hot daylight. Insects the size of a human palm skittered among the detritus of the dense jungle like floor, while birds of all feathers called out, their presence masked by the vast foilage that seemed to stretch on for infinity into the distance. 

Kyle followed the guide, keeping an eye out for everything around. The environment felt quite like a typical colonial outpost, genetically modified permaculture used to terraform and create a livable environment for humans. Yet, as he ascended towards the glistening white peaks that formed the Culdao Peaks, the level of arcite infused into the air was ever slightly higher.

*What is arcite, exactly?* Kyle used the spare time he had now to ponder on the nature of the element that his abnormal strength was derived from. Sure, calling it an exotic element was an easy way to accept its mysterious properties, but Kyle had never heard of an element that adhered to very specific engravings as well as their sequence. 

The presence of a fixed sequence as evidenced in his tests made it clear that arcite followed a language of sort. None of the books that he had consumed in the past months on arctech had really touched on it. They simply prescribed formulas and patterns that has been revised and reformed over decades of experiments. None dare to claim they knew the exact guideline of arcite and the underlying rules that governed its behaviour. 

What made it even more confounding was that the supposed exotic element was nearly everywhere to be found in the area, as prevalent as air itself. Exotic elements of the Galactic Era were usually found in unusual geological formations or extreme conditions, such as specific quadrants of an accretion disk or the innards of a collapsing wormhole. Following conventional laws of density, the arcia density should follow gravity, but the air of the Culdao Peaks was a clear argument that arcia did not agree with that theory, seemingly increasing in strength as he ascended up from the valley.

*It can't be magic.* Kyle wasn't about to succumb and simply hand-wave it. His powers and System most likely depended on it - he would need to make sure he had the finances and resources to discover the truth behind his reincarnation. *One impossible thing at a time.*

As Kyle squinted at his surroundings which was compromised of raging gorges and avalanche debris, Sasha trailed him from behind, lost in her own thoughts. They trekked in silence, the sounds of nature making up for the lack of conversation until Sasha suddenly made the first move. [Sir, can I ask a question?]

Kyle was slightly taken aback, never having experienced Sasha taking the initiative to ask him a question. Usually it would be a straight-to-the-point report, an affirmation or an problem, this behavior having stemmed from Kyle training her personally.

"Of course."

[Why did you not order me to retrieve the information regarding the Dzi Flower Sand? You could have done something else instead of trekking here.]

The question caught Kyle completely off-guard, his mouth opening slightly to answer before he contemplated it even more. "I needed to see the source for myself."

[I could have brought a light-capturer.]

"Well, then I wanted to take a break, to survey the territory a little." Kyle came up with a filler answer quickly, but deep down he too did not know why - he could have found a more efficient way to recover his mental instead of trekking on a three-hour journey.

Even in the Galactic Era, Kyle can't remember the last time he took a walk like this. He had never done this with anyone, not even his family. *Why am I even doing all of this? Would it simply end up the same way?* Yet he could not think of any alternatives to his current plan, having been a crime lord most of his life. It was like second-nature to him, something he couldn't shake. He had half-joked in his former life that even during retirement, he might act as a consultant of sorts.

Even given a new leash of life, Kyle never felt like the wheel had stopped for him. There was always something important to do, something to gain, something to win, something to conquer, something to -

[Sir, can I ask another question?]

Kyle's train of thought was interrupted, but he recovered quickly. "If this is about the off-day you took, I am perfectly fine with it. You have served me well thus far, but I do hope you will inform me before you decide to do such things. An attack on the Seven Snakes may occur during such an outing."

Sasha's face immediately began to redden slightly, her head quickly diverting lower as though she was focused on where she was stepping through the rough trekking trail. [I apologize, sir, I will consult you in the future. My question is not related to that.]

"Ask."

[Sir, what are you aiming for?]

Kyle stopped briefly, turning to give Sasha a slightly confused look."I'm aiming to reach the Snow Song Tribe to obtain more information on the Dzi Flower Sand. Did I not make this clear?"

[No, sir, I meant in general, for you and the Seven Snakes. What are you aiming to achieve?]

A calm silence reigned between the two as only the sounds of their soles squashing the wet mud echoed amidst the teeming forest. "... If I told you, you would not believe me. No one on this planet would."

[Sir, I joined you to achieve my own strength, to be able to stand tall. To survive by my two hands. For someone as strong as you, what is there left to achieve?]

Kyle was not upset with Sasha's inquisitive questioning - he much preferred his followers to be able to make creative decisions on the job, which meant that they must be able to think beyond their gravity well. "I am not the strongest in this world by any measure, or even the universe at large. There are still peaks to climb, worlds to dominate, mysteries to uncover. Perhaps you think that this city and its surrounding regions are all that are important to me. But in my eyes, even if I lost everything that I've gained here, it would mean very little in my grand scheme."

Sasha pondered for a few seconds. [I don't quite understand. I... I don't have a goal beyond achieving strength.]

"You lack the foresight. You have not see what I have seen, so you do not know what is possible, and what lies beyond. But I have." Kyle asserted as he clambered towards a short cliff, pulling himself upwards before the streaming rays of light finally enveloping his body as if he had ascended to the sky, his confident face looking back at Sasha while he extended a hand. "If you do not know what to do, then follow me - I will give you your purpose, to see the top of all things, here and now, past and present."

Sasha stared in awe for a moment, before grabbing onto his hand, stepping off the cliff and climbing up to come into the view of a what seemed to be a dormant caldera, the basin awash with a lush forest and a beautiful sparkling lake that dazzled the eyes. Sasha stared in awe for a moment, the view astounding. She did not dare say what was in her heart, but vowed solemnly in secret to follow Kyle till she saw what he meant.

"There's the tribe, I guess we had no need of the guide after all... where's the guide?"

In the midst of their conversation, they had left the goblin guide far behind, exhausted and way out of breath, unable to keep up with the intensive pace of Sasha and Kyle. Sasha returned back down the path, hoisting the guide up in her arms like a princess to the same cliff where Kyle was surveying the location.

Kyle noted the almost perfect rim of the caldera that extended in a circular fashion. *Too perfect, in fact.* He suspected that there was more than meets the eye, especially with the presence of the Oracle Chamber embedded in the very mountain he was stepping on now. 

The trio began to descend into the basin, following a carved staircase along the inner rim. The snow had long melted, though some still retained their form, tucked away in the corners under rocks and trees. Hardly any birds were present, a stark contrast from the incessant din from the forest before. They soon reached the tribe's outer wall, a makeshift wooden palisade no different from any other goblin den, except for the cast iron shield that hung over its entrance. 

As they approached, the watchtower guards began to panic, hurriedly opening the gate for him. None of the tribal goblins dared to oppose Kyle, all of them knowing exactly who he was. Some of them were even more afraid of the woman next to him, though Kyle was not focused on intimidating them, instead having one of them lead him and Sasha towards the supposed stone beaches of the glacier lake. The exhausted goblin guide was offered food and drink, while curious goblins gathered around him. 

< What were they like? > One of the more inqusitive goblin children asked. < Are they are strong as they said they are? >

< Far more monstrous than any adventurer who even made it this far... The male human is even a mind-reader, able to converse with the female monster at will! >

A wave of ooh and gasps attracted more towards the guide, as the guide began to exaggerate his boring trek with Kyle and Sasha, giving birth to rumors and folklore that would last for generations to come.

True to King Sahusa's words, the surrounding stone beach that would've been covered in snow was now glittering under the bright sunlight, the blue ice remnants of the glacier still floating in the large lake that was slowly draining out into the rivers and tributaries beyond. Amdist the whistling wind that came from all directions, Kyle bent down to pick a random stone of the beach, revealing the rainbow Dzi Flower Sand in small but significant amounts, scattered around in what seemed to be a repeating circular pattern, encompassing the perimeter of the lake in waves. 

However, the pattern was not consistent along its length, having certain nodes and branches that were cutoff abruptly, as though it was entering the ground. Both Kyle and Sasha had no clue what the pattern meant, having to return to the Snow Song Tribe to question its shaman. 

< We give our thanks to the Mother of the Heavens, Dignitary of the Eighteen Stars by arranging the accumulated sand into the pattern pre-ordained by our ancestors past. It is through this pattern that we offer back some of the energy that we have been gifted by the Mother above, to nourish the environment. > The shaman explained as he rested cross-legged in the center of his tent, the walls rife with ornaments, bracelets and paintings created using the excess Dzi Flower Sand. Even weapons and armour were neatly displayed on a rack, each of them glistening in the sand along the mystical engravings that ran their length.

It was clear from the age of the items that there was not much to sieve from the environment each year, with some of the bracelet dating back decades or even centuries. Sasha stared long and hard at a dazzling falchion, adorned with the largest Dzi Flower Sand jewels the tribe had to offer, with ancient cursive arcia engravings marking its entire length. For some innate reason she felt drawn to the sword, though the leery eyes from the shaman clearly indicated that the falchion was only reserved for special ocassions.

Kyle instead only saw the relics as materials. He had half a mind to simply scavenge what was on display when he and Sasha were suddenly handed a ceremonial bracelet each by the shaman.

MG404: [Item | Snow Song Ordained Dzi Bracelet (Intermediate) | *Blessed by the foregoblins of yore.* | +15 MAX MP, +1.25% MP Cost Reduction on all skills.]

*What?!* Kyle was not expecting the effect of the Dzi Flower Sand to be this powerful - while the cost reduction was small, it was still a step towards mass adoption of highly-efficient arctech equipment. *This could create amazing cost savings in the regenerators and in subsequent devices.*

He hurriedly inspected the bracelet, noticing that the bracelet was made of two layers: fused Dzi Flower Sand into a silica cover over a wooden base, the cover protecting the wood from decay. The engravings on it were unlike anything he had seen in the textbooks he had gathered so far. They seemed more like runic symbols with clear starting and ending points, as if they were standalone pictures that could be slotted into a jigsaw in any shape or fashion. 

< Shue, Yul, Uryag... > 

The shaman and Kyle stared at each other in confusion. "What did you say?" Kyle squinted his eyes.

< I did not say anything...? > The shaman glanced around frantically, before his bulging eyes landed on Sasha, who's ceremonial bracelet was now glowing with a red aura brilliantly as it laid on her palms. < The female monster can speak?! >

Sasha looked up in astonishment, her head swivelling quickly between the shaman and Kyle staring at her. [Sir? What's wrong?]

"What did you say just now?"

[I didn't say anything, I was just reading what was written on the bracelet.]

"Hmm... read it again."

[Yes, sir...] < Shue, Yul, Uryag, Golus, Kiear, Samki Polwa Erix > At this point, even Sasha was surprised by the words that were coming out from her mouth, having never spoken once since she had been kidnapped from her homeland. As she completed the sentence, the bracelet vibrated vigorously, the red glowing aura intensifying before the silica cover began to melt, seeping into the pores of her palms like searing lava. 

Sasha winced and tried to remove the bracelet, but the process was over as abruptly as it had began, leaving only the wooden layer of the bracelet behind, the Dzi Flower Sand somehow absorbed into her body with a burn mark now on the inside of her right palm. 

"Sasha, your mouth!" Kyle hurriedly grabbed her face, checking over as purplish veins began to emerge, arcing and snaking under her skin from the edges of her mouth, forming symmetrical unnerving symbols on both of her cheeks. "Are you alright? Can you speak?"

She tried to speak the normal human language, but she could not utter a comprehensible word, instead only guttural sounds being emitted from her throat. [Sir..., I can't!]. In a moment of panic at having lost the temporary ability to speak, she hurriedly picked up what was left of the disintegrating bracelet, reading the sentence out again. < Shue, Yul - >

Before she could complete the sentence, Kyle quickly grabbed her back and smacked the bracelet away, forcing her to look at him. "Calm down - we'll get to the bottom of this together. I can't lose you to an unknown phenomenon, let's not make any rash moves until we know exactly what happened."

While Sasha took a deep breath, controlling her emotions, she noticed that the shaman was already grovelling at her feet. < The female monster speaks the words of power long lost to our tribe! Great-grandfather, I finally have found the successor to our ways. Quickly, we must have her breed with - >

"Nobody is breeding with anybody here." Kyle cut that train of thought immediately. "If you make any moves against her will, I will annihilate your entire goblin holding and have you trapped in the deepest mines. Or she could do that herself. Are we clear?" 

The shaman nodded vigorously, hurriedly backing off out of the tent, no doubt to spread the rumor. Kyle did not mind the rumors spreading, as it only helped to solidify their rule over the goblins even more. As Sasha continued to contemplate what she had just discovered about herself, Kyle was now more focused on the seemingly magical properties of the Dzi Flower Sand, that did not seem to be recognized by his System. *So the System is not omnipotent after all.*

This further advanced his various theories of the history of this planet, but that would be a discussion for later. The issue of the most pressing importance now was how to collect enough of the Dzi Flower Sand for now to accelerate his potion making business. Kyle returned out to the beach, inspecting where there were natural formations of the Dzi Flower Sands as guided by the local goblins. Unlike the fine grains that he had seen them scatter into the pattern, he found them in bulbous nodules that were ridden with dents, the Dzi Flower Sand bonding with something else. 

He picked up one of them in his hand, reading the System information message.

MG404: [Item | Dzi-Nodia Amalgamation | *Natural state of Dzi Flower Sand.* | Dzi Flower Sand Amalgamation with Toxic Nodia. Can be separated through melting.]

*Just like mercury and gold...* Already Kyle was running possible templates of processing and production in his mind. If the soil and water here had traces of the Dzi Flower Sand, he just needed to collect enough of the Toxic Nodia - only that he did not know anything about the new liquid element. That information alone was easy to obtain from the Snow Song Tribe, who had been melting the nodules to obtain the Dzi Flower Sand. 

Back within the tribe's central area, there was a designated tent for the extraction - two pairs of goblins donning on makeshift masks made of animal skins, as the greyish fumes twirled and spiralled into the air, buoyant by the heat from the hot iron tongs that clamped each nodule, before slowly drifting lower to the floor, accumulating like a dense mist that. 

< The scent is intoxicating, and may cause delusions as well as corrosion to both the body and the environment... > One of the goblins handed Kyle a flask of condensed Toxic Nodia, collected from the ambient clouds that hung low to the ground by shabbily constructed contraptions that concentrator the vapor over time, albeit very slowly.

MG404: [Item | Flask of Toxic Nodia | *For a quick escape from life* | Highly corrosive and lethal to organic material.]

With the information now in hand, Kyle and Sasha trekked back down to the valley holding a satchel of the Dzi Flower Sand and the Flask of Toxic Nodia in hand, the exhausted goblin guide left behind overnight to recuperate. 

By the time they had returned, it was nearing evening, the same ambient pink hue dominating the sky of dusk once more, overlooking the myriad of lights that began to appear all throughout the valley. Countless lives and houses dotted the landscape as goblin farmers took a well-deserved rest, while the mine rotate shifts, Feldon yelling at the top of his lungs as he oversaw the operations. 

[Sir, I would like to return to the tribe tomorrow. I believe I can improve my skills there and find out what I'm truly capable of.] Sasha suddenly spoke up. Clearly her being able to speak specific words was a life-changing event for her, and Kyle had no intention of restricting his follower's growth. 

"No problem. But I need you ready in two weeks, back in Raktor."

[Understood. I will be prepared.]

Kyle watched as Sasha returned to her own living quarters in King Sahusa's palace, his mind considering what had happened at the tribe. *For Sasha to be able to read the old engravings, she might hold the key to deciphering the true nature of arcia. A trip to her homeland would provide many benefits. A future endeavor to keep in mind*

He returned to the Oracle Chamber, intending to begin his attempt to manufacture the potion. "Inform anyone approaching the Chamber that I am not to be disturbed unless it is news of unrest in Raktor." Kyle waved his hand in the air as he approached a prepared table, the chemical reactants all already laid out for him by some of the repurposed seed storage drones. 

[Understood, Adminstrator.]

Cracking his hands, he began to experiment on a various combinations, applying everything he knew about potion brewing from his previous attempts. However, Haui himself did not know the exact ratio or formula required. With little Dzi Flower Sand in hand, he had to be extremely careful with the ratio he was using, trying to reverse-engineer the formula in small doses instead of a full flask.

Before long, he had multiple trays full of precalculated Dzi Flower sand in petri-dishes scavenged from other parts of the Oracle Chamber. "Confirm milligrams."

[Scanning - 0.1 mg to 1mg in rows of 50 confirmed.]

Kyle began to divide the other ingredients, the brute force experiment beginning. He kept track of the percentages he had developed, as well as using the insight on Poair Leaves and Griess Powder obtained from before. 

The hours flew past in a blur, Kyle taking quick power naps and spending upwards of 18 hours a day in complete silence save for the hum of the gas tanks all around the former observation lab, his entire being completely attentive on each results. 

Hours turned into days, and by the eighth day, Kyle was near his wits end, having ran nearly every combination of the three new elements for the Mind-Bending Potion : Culdao Water, Tusken Rabbit Meat and Dzi Flower Sand. His satchel was running low, and he was considering if he should return to the tribe for more. 

He flipped through all the results of his combination, even picking up one petri-dish and inspecting it.

MG404: [Item | Unknown Object/s| *Placeholder description for when user attempts to mix random things.* | The System was unable to determine the effect or origin of the mixture.]

Kyle gritted his teeth, picking out multiple perti-dishes and obtaining the same information over and over again in desperation. As he picked up what felt like the ten-thousandth petri-dish, a notification appeared in his face.

MG404: [Title Obtained | Potion Inspector (Advanced) | *A reward for the tenacious squinting of eyes and tearing of personal hair over potions.* | +25 INT, Increased description of potions and residuals examined.]

He hardly cared about the snarky descriptions any longer, quickly picking up the petri-dish 

MG404: [Item | Failed Mind-Bending Potion| *One does not simply throw random particulates and expect a potion.* | Order of placement is wrong.]

*Order of placement?* Kyle quickly revisited his experiments, noting that he put the Dzi Flower Sand first into the petri-dish, before simply laying the rest and pouring the Culdao Water over. 

The next three days was a hectic sprint, as Kyle followed the breadcrumbs left by the mysterious descriptions while trying every single combination he could think off. Finally, nearly one and a half weeks after he began, he had the method and percentage down.

"35% Poair Leaves, 5% Griess Powder, 10% Tusken Rabbit Meat, 5% Dzi Flower Sand, 45% Culdao Water. First pound the power into the meat by massging it, wrapping it in Poair Leaves, before boiling it in Culdao Water, and then sprinkle Dzi Flower Sand in." Kyle let out a sigh of relief as he held the miniscule test tube up to the light, seeing the rainbow distortions of the lab's inbuilt lighting through the fluid and glass.

MG404: [Item | Mind-Bending Potion (Advanced) | *Sends the user on an illusionary trip fueled by their subconscious, rendering them incapable of normal functions. Lasts up to a day on a full dose.* | *Recommended Dosage: Half a bottle for an adult human male for three days. Ingredients: Poair Leaves, Greiss Powder, Culdao Grass, Tusken Rabbit Meat, Dzi Flower Sand.*]

MG404: [Title Obtained | Potion Crafter (Advanced) | *For pounding meat repeatedly. Mind-bending in itself.* | *+25 INT, Increased description of potions examined, +20% chance to craft an intermediate potion when using basic materials. 20% increased chance of discovering intermediate potion recipes per attempt, stacking. Resets on discovery.*]

Kyle grinned to himself as he grabbed a bit of Absolute Euria from his sample flask, dropping three drips in. 

MG404: [Item | Euria-Infused Mind-Bending Potion (Advanced) | *Sends the user on an illusionary trip fueled by their subconscious, rendering them incapable of normal functions. Lasts up to a day on a full dose. Highly Addictive* | *Recommended Dosage: Half a bottle for an adult human male over three days. Ingredients: Poair Leaves, Greiss Powder, Culdao Grass, Tusken Rabbit Meat, Dzi Flower Sand, Absolute Euria.*]

Despite all of these achievements, Kyle still did not have a consistent method of producing Dzi Flower Sand. In order to extract it from the environment, he would have to utilize Toxic Nodia repeatedly, but even Toxic Nodia itself was hard to obtained.

[Administrator, a man named Feldon is asking to see you.]

"If it's not about Raktor, I don't care."

[He claims that miners are falling ill by the dozens from toxic fumes.]

Kyle's eyes widened as he quickly grabbed his cloak, flipping it on as he met Feldon outside the Chamber. "Sir, it's real bad, there's this weird greyish mist that is pooling on the lower shafts. None of our miners can go any deeper than that, it's like we hit a gas pocket."

Instead of the concerned expression Feldon expected to see, a small grin was already growing on Kyle's face, his eyes not even looking at Feldon. "Looks like a new cash cow is here to stay."
# Chapter 85 - Imminent

Gordon grunted as he gripped a wrench tightly, trying to loosen a nut that was bolted tightly to the machine. "Come on, you dumb shit, come on - Urgh!" The wrench lost its alignment, the imbalance throwing him backwards as it went soaring through the sky, clattering onto the factory floor. 

The managers all stood around staring at Gordon desparately trying to fix the machine, irking him even more. "What are you dumb idiots standing around for? This is not the only machine broken, isn't it?"

"Sir, but we don't know how to fix the other machines as well!"

"JUST TRY SOMETHING! If we let the machines falter any longer, we'll be seriously behind our deadline! You think your jobs will be safe as well?!" Gordon yelled at the top of his lungs, frightening the managers into action. 

Gordon wiped the oil off his cheeks and nose, ordering another group of technicians to take over fixing the machine. He gritted his teeth as he stomped through the factory, the last three weeks of non-stop production taking a toll on him. He could not even take time off to go enjoy himself at the Seductive Serpent or the casino, not with the ever-increasing number of problems. 

At first, it was only a single machine that broke down. Then afterwards it became injuries, casualties, workplace safety issues. With each machine broken, the other assembly lines were driven to work harder by Gordon, only exacerbating the fatigue cycles of the other production machine and causing them to fail as well. *How in the world are we supposed to hit the target now?*

What's more, there was rumors of the formation of a secret group of sorts, one made of workers under the blessing of the Society. Gordon had no doubts that it was this group that was attempting to sabotage the production lines, disguising the machines failures as an error in management or overwork. "Crack down on any, ANY worker that tries to tamper with the damn machines. I want light-capturers set up everywhere all around the clock, and anyone who is so much of a suspect, arrest them indefinitely!"

The pressure and stress had turned Gordon into a fearsome manager, partly driven by the fear of what Kyle might do to him when Kyle returned to Raktor. As Gordon grumbled and complained to every foreman he could get his hands on, the production technicians kept their heads low, unwilling to lose their job or stand up directly. Amdist the numerous faces who stole a glance at the raging Gordon, Culo stared at Gordon, his face burning with hatred. 

"Relax, comrade." A hand was placed on his shoulder, reminding him not to stare to long. "Your vigor and loyalty shall prove itself in due time."

"Sorry, Gunther. It's just... that manager is not even in the slightest bit remorseful of what pains he is inflicting on the workers. It's like he doesn't even give a single shit about safety at all!"

"That is what all the pigs at the top think of us. Just mere pawns to move around so as to fill their coffers. A disgusting social order, imposed by force. But soon, we shall have that force soon." Gunther muttered in a low tone, focused on etching the armor piece in front of him.

"When will we act?"

"Soon, soon. And you shall lead the charge." Gunther smiled as the lunch bell rang, the workers congregating in the lunch canteen once more. 

Instead of the usual dejected faces that used to be ever-present amongst the workers, they instead held knowing looks, their eyes glancing shiftly as they gave slight nods to others around, eating in silence and watching out for Seven Snakes guards. 

None of them talked to each other, not even Culo and Gunther as they sat away from each other amdist unknown workers, masking their affilation to one another. If the Seven Snakes guard had been looking carefully, however, they would have noticed a burning rage and fire in nearly half of the workers present. 

Gunther shared a glance with Culo, before motioning with his finger, as if he was twirling his curly hair. Instantly, two other workers starting yelling at each other. "That pudding was mine, you bitchface!" The first hollered as loud as he could, attracting attention.

"Oh yea? Well too bad! What you going to do?" The second taunted, before earning the full force of a metal lunch tray still dripping with sauce right into his face. The tray spun off, smacking into another worker who immediately took offense, a brawl breaking out.

*My time to shine.* Culo finished his lunch quickly, standing up to return his tray before walking off. But instead of heading back towards the production lines, he headed towards a Seven Snakes recruit blocking a small door, who was clearly distracted by the fight brewing in the lunch canteen and speaking rapidly into his arctech radio. 

*Once I get past these doors, I'll smuggle the-*

Before he could sneak past through the door, a gauntlet suddenly grabbed his collar behind, dragging him back to come face-to-face with the recruit. "Where the fuck do you think you are going? You're not allowed past here!"

Culo didn't reply, instead acting oblivious and putting on his most believable act. "Sir, I was just trying to go to the toliet! I'm new here!"

"Don't try to fool me, your number shows you're clearly one of the first day hires! Now get back before I-" A bowl of soup smashed against the Seven Snakes recruit's head, prompting him to look away, buying enough time for Culo to break free of the recruit's grip, before twisting the recruit's head around into an armlock, dragging him through the door before anybody spotted him.

Culo jerked his head as the grappled recruit attempted to wrestle out of the lock, throwing punches in desperation. An elbow drove deep into Culo's ribs, causing him to wince and nearly loosen his grip. In one smooth motion, he drew a small purple potion flask from his overalls' pocket and pulled the cork with his teeth, before pouring it onto the recruit's face.

The recruit sputtered as the liquid blocked his view, but his motions began to slow down tremedously, as if he were slowly becoming more and more lethargic. "You won't get away with this!" He spoke through an ever-tightening grip on his neck.

"By the time you wake up, we'll be done." Culo tighten his lock even more, cutting the airflow to the recruit's brain who finally began to lay limp. 

Culo hurriedly stripped him of his armour, putting on the helmet. He found a nearby empty crate to dump the recruit in, heaving the body over and shifting the crate to a hidden place between the towering shelves of materials and rifles. 

He had not seen the layout of the entire factory before, but memorized the blueprints for over a week and a half now. Acting with purpose, he deliberately approached the loading dock where wagon drivers were waiting for the next shipment to deliver to a separate storehouse. 

"Hey, Peter!" Another Seven Snakes guard stationed there called out to him towards him. "Whatchu doing here? Skiving? Weren't you just shouting for help at the canteen just now?"

"Yea, it's too rough, I had to get out of there."

"What?! Are you crazy? If we let the workers riot out of control they'll send us to the damn Culdao Peaks! I sure as hell don't want to end up like those mad murderous fuckers who came back - they give me the creeps."

"If you wanna do something about it, go ahead. I got an order from the top that I'm swapping with you."

"Huh? First I heard of that, I didn't see anything like that during our morning briefing." The other guard frowned as he leaned back against the crate, eyeing Culo warily.

"Ask the vipers, I'm just following orders." 

"Vipers? Huh... okay. How bad is in there? I'm not going in there alone, right?"

"I don't know, but you finally get to beat people up, right?"

"Damn right I do. One of the perks of being a Seven Snakes, yea? By the way, you sure you alright? Your voice is a bit funny." The other Seven Snakes guard squinted, inspecting Culo.

Instead of letting him inquire anymore, Culo brandished the rifle he stole from the recruit, his finger resting on the trigger. "You making fun of me? We can settle this outside."

"Oh yea?" The other guard grinned, standing up to his full height with his rifle brought to bear as well. Culo clutched the grip of his rifle, his mind racing. *I don't know how to use the rifle at all... shit! What if he-*

"Alright, alright, you got it man. Hey, what's the matter? Relax, I'm going. Have fun watching wooden crates move to and fro." The other Seven Snakes guard slung his rifle back and held his hands up in jovial surrender, walking off with the rifle towards the lunch canteen.

As soon as Culo took his post, a unmarked wagon drove into the loading bay, the driver getting out and giving a quick nod to Culo. The two moved with purpose, hauling crates out one-by-one and stacking them into the back of the wagon. 

"Hey, hey, hey!" One of the loaders ran over panicking. "Those crates aren't supposed to be shipped until two days later!"

"I got orders to get this out as fast as possible. The military wants them right now. Or are you saying you know more than me?" Culo assumed a threatening stance, the feeble loader shrinking immediately and scampering off without another complaint. 

Soon, the wagon was loaded to the brim with almost ten crates of rifles and armor, just as the end of lunch time was heralded by the ever-present gong of the factory's clock. Culo slapped the back of the wagon, prompting the driver to leave as soon as he had arrived. He ditched the stolen armour and rifle in a separate crate, before quickly returning to his position in the assembly line. 

As he walked slowly through the factory floor, guards and managers alike all ran past him, intent on containing the growing riot in the lunch canteen. No one suspected him at all, with none stopping to even give him a second glance. 

A hand rested on his shoulder, nearly causing him to yelp out of anxiety. "Calm down, comrade. Is it done?"

"The wagon should be on its way to Wrent now."

"Good. You have proven your loyalty to the cause." Gunther nodded, taking a seat next to him. No one suspected the two of them, and neither would they try to disrupt their work. The two of them were by far the most productive members of the production team here - which only hardened Culo's heart against the managers, especially when his only reward was an increase in hours with no changes in wages. 

The work progressed without so much as a word shared between the two, each of them focusing on their work while the rioters at the lunch canteen were ferried out. One of them slightly nodded in Gunther's direction, Gunther returning a knowing look. 

The atmosphere in the factory was like a burning tension, a undetectable rage that spread like wildfire. Managers, foremen, and Seven Snakes guards were well aware of the growing unrest and disobedience of the workers, taking proactive action to check workers for weapons and other equipment they might be smuggling out.

Another grating sound erupted on the factory floor, the sound of another machine jammed once more. Already the common sounds of managers whining and foremen screaming could be heard, a part of the recent work environment. Each wail gave Gunther a slight smile on his face, while Culo kept his grin hidden, hardly unable to wait for the right time to strike. 

Soon, their shift was over, and like clockwork over the last two weeks, Culo and Gunther made their separate way to yet another meeting point, each location different from the day before. This time, the meeting point was far from the factory, near the boundary towards the Left Paw of the Red Lion's district. 

As Culo rasped his hand on a discreet door, it swung open, welcoming hands dragging him and celebrating with loud cheer in the musky basement, a former arcia boiler room that had now be outfitted to be a gathering spots. Chairs and tables were loosely arranged under the flickering light of the arctech lanterns pilfered from other abandoned buildings. 

Nearly a hundred workers were gathered here in the meeting, many congratulating Culo on the successful heist. "Great work, lad! Knew you had in you, you're one of us now."

Culo beamed as he accepted handshake and hugs one after another, uncaring about the grime, soot and oil present on all of them. They wore them as signs and marks of their hard labour. "Of course, anything for us. But they would find out soon enough."

The workers began to stream in one by one, until the room was packed to the brim, each of them engaging in energetic conversations about the future. "Fuck those pigs, let them find out we got weapons. Maybe they'll finally learn their fucking place and stop killing children!" Another worker yelled out, clearly drunk on stolen alcohol. 

"Damn right, those fuckers live on our back-breaking labour"

"Yea, those managers have no clue how to run a fucking factory. If it was me, I'll make sure everyone only does eight hours, and no more children on the floor!"

"We should strike, right now! Now's the chance!" A worker shouted out, some groaning in response. 

"Correct, Comrade. The time to strike is tonight." Gunther's voice carried over the din of celebratory cheer, instantly mollifying the workers who were all caught off-guard.

"Tonight? But we're not ready yet! It'll take time for us to get used to the weapons and armour to mount a proper resistance!"

"There is no time. They would begin to crack down immediately once they discover the missing weapons and armour. How long do you still want to be oppressed? How long do you still want to suffer? All of you may have joined the union for a different reason, be it for the Goddess, for a better wage, or for safety. But we are all united against one single foe - the Seven Snakes." Gunther took an iron stick, jabbing it onto a table where a simple crude map of the district had been etched out, already rife with marks indicating their various outpost.

"Over the past month, we have accumulated thousands of valiant comrades and heroic brothers from all walks of life, some of whom are currently languishing in prisons, toiling away in unknown conditions. Right beneath the very floor of the factory, enslaved prisoners toil away unseen, unheard! All men are equal: Goddess, Sanctum, or neither! The only men who are less that dirt are those who try to lord themselves over others." Gunther riled up the workers.

"YEA!"

"And they are only propped up into their position by virtue of our labour! They live frivousvly on the fruits of our labour, while we grit our teeth and break our backs just for a paltry wage, one that is highly dangerous. Think of all the children and men who have died in accidents so far - how many could have prevented? Yet what do the managers do when they see one of us die? They strike another mark of the list of thousands, and replace us with yet another migrant."

"They treat us like cattle!" One of the workers roared in response, earning agreement from the others.

"We might outnumber them, but we're outgunned! Kyle and his vipers are ruthless to the bone - they control our housing as well!" Some of the more cautious workers spoke out, many of whom were living in the apartments built specifically for that role. 

"Would you rather die free, or live like livestocks, cramped into apartments that barely has enough living space for two, to sacrifice your souls for the production of weapons meant to kill other men?" Gunther shot back. "NOW IS THE TIME! Tonight, the slavers and tyrants will know what it means to oppress us, to step on us. For enough is enough - we fight! For wages, safety, and unity!"

"For wages, safety and unity!" The workers chanted back at the top of their lungs, Culo screaming at the top of his lungs. 

"Our insider in the Seven Snakes has already been informed. Operation Brilliant Flame is now in effect." Gunther began to organize the workers according to the preordained plan, dividing them into attack groups and handing each of them a crate filled to the brim with arcite ore. As Culo stepped forward to receive his crate, Gunther instead pulled him off to the side. "You have already proven yourself, comrade. Stay out of this one."

Culo looked a bit forlorn, until Gunther led him to another room, which clearly housed the upper council of the union, who were already frantically issuing orders through messengers and coordinating ground movement through a myriad of arctech radios laid out along the walls. A replica map of the district was already being utilized to mobilize each attack group from various locations. He recognized markers like the Lusty Arcian and the Seductive Serpent, making him hesitate a little at what Gunther was planning for him. "Gunther, those locations would be heavily defended by the Seven Snakes - they are mainstays of their operations. I don't think I would be able to -"

"Do not worry, those places are mere distractions to allow the rest of our brothers to strike accurately. And you are no longer a mere foot soldier - You will now be part of the council. Your valor will be critical in helming our protests and strikes tomorrow."

Culo's heart surged with pride, nodding vigorously as a young messenger brushed past them, hurriedly delivering a sealed letter to another cell group by foot. The moment the messenger left the hideout however, he instead made a sharp turn, instead moving through a nearby slum to lose anyone tracking him. 

The messenger deftly avoided the dwellers and pickpockets, skipping over clearly intoxicated bodies and swerving past a crazy lunatic screaming at the top of his lungs in joy, his mouth frothing with green bubbles. Sharp turns and tight corners masked his path, the messenger soon approaching an inconspicuous building, seeing a hooded individual waiting in the dark alleyway.

The messenger slipped the individual a rolled message. "Duplicate of the letter sent to the other union members. The pot boils tonight. If I'm caught..."

"Understood. The Seven Snakes never forgets one of their own."

With that short exchange, the messenger left as fast as he arrived, the hooded individual now retreating into a recess and reading the letter. He whipped out an arctech radio with a clear panic in his actions. [Reporting to vipers - the workers are attacking tonight.]

# Chapter 86 - Prison Break

"Is it a hoax?" Damian poured through the duplicate letter in his hand, Keith and Niko gathering around him at the main office in the shopping arcade. "For all we know, this could be a distraction."

"They say here that they are going to blow up everything Seven Snakes affilated - I doubt they have the capacity to do so." Niko scratched his chin after pinning all the written targets on a map laid out on a circular table. 

"Not when we're missing weapons from the factory." Keith groaned. "I just heard from Gordon ten entire crates are missing. That's enough to outfit two hundred of them."

"Shit, that's basically a turf war all over again! Why didn't we post guards there?" Niko argued. "I told you we should have tripled the security at the factory. Now that the factory is in shit, Kyle will be pissed when he comes back from the Culdao Peaks."

"We gave our word we'll handle, and we will. No time to groan or whine - let's solve it." Damian mustered up his authority, calling in all the cobras on duty and mobilizing every member. "Get all of them armed and out onto the streets. Priority is the highest performing businesses. I want twenty men on every fucking entrance of all our establishments. Check the prisoners too, make sure none of them are escaping."

Damian did not have the same level of confidence as Kyle, but as the underboss his orders were followed to the letter, the basic training and desentization exercises at the Culdao Peaks kicking into action, arming themselves at the armory. The gang began to move like a well-oiled machine, cobras and their squads reporting in like clockwork. 

"Do we even have enough men to cover everything?" Niko asked as he tabulated the assigned squads, clerks in the office yelling commands and orders over arctech radios while organizing supporting groups. "At this rate, we'll be spread way too thinly."

"No, but I'll be damned if I let even a single one of our branches get bombed. It would be a humiliation. At least we should post five men to the smaller ones, that way we can mitigate the damage done-"

"Cancel that order." A familiar voice entered the office suddenly, prompting the three of them to quickly bow in respect. 

"Sir, I didn't know you'll be back so soon." Damian muttered while Kyle strode past him with Sasha in tow, along with a dozen veteran soldiers accompanying them from the Culdao Peaks. 

"I heard from Adrian. Have all men concentrate on our main establishments, leave the branches undefended."

Damian, Niko and Keith looked at each other uncomfortably, but accepted the order nonetheless, having already established that Kyle's orders were final. 

"Damian, Sasha, a word in my office. Niko and Keith, handle it now." Kyle motioned for Sasha and Damian to join him in the private office overlooking the district, the vast expanse of the South Sector extending before them in a never-ending kaleidoscope of street lights. 

"Damian, Sasha. It's undeniable. The mole must be one of the vipers." Kyle spoke quickly.

Sasha hardly reacted, but Damian was flabbergasted. "What?! That's impossible - we did a background check on every viper, and Adrian is on the lookout for any suspicious movements. The mole might be one of the newer recruits-"

"Then explain how ten crates of weapons were stolen from us right under our noses. Not just the viper himself - we most likely have multiple turncoats within our ranks." Kyle pulled out a letter from his coat, handing it to Damian. "I have the latest list of confirmed union council members from Adrian. The ringleader is a man named Gunther - who apparently is living right under our very noses in the housing complex under a different name, yet we do not have any documents nor evidence of his stay.  Someone among us is helping him."

Damian understood the underlying implications. "Are you still suspecting my brother?"

"Anyone who handles the business and logistical aspect is subject to scrutiny. Gordon, Reese, Keith, Monica. Even Adrian himself. I only trust you two, and I highly suggest you do not trust any other member within the gang, no matter how close you are with them." 

"Why do you trust me, but not my brother? He's in charge of the finances, the trade school."

"The reason I trust you, Damian, is because of your ability and loyalty as the underboss thus far to carry out my will, despite how unreasonable my orders might have seem. On the other hand, for the past month, Keith and Niko were clearly against them, with Keith being the most vocal. If I took any of Keith's suggestions, the Seven Snakes may have very well ceased to exist at this point of time. Until proven innocent, I cannot forgo my suspicions."

Damian winced under the weight of the accusations, though he could not deny that Keith had been acting more and more aggressively in recent meetings, especially with regards on how to deal with the growing unrest. "Then what do we do now? How do we smoke them out? What's the plan?" 

"The plan has not changed since this whole debacle started. The attack has two goals in mind: the first is to prevent the weapons factory from fulfilling the contract. The second is tarnishing the reputation of the Seven Snakes as weak and riddled with incompetency."

"And I assume you know who is behind all of this."

"Of course. But it is still a theory. It remains to be seen if it is the Ardent Cretins or another gang supporting him from behind the scenes." Kyle twirled a pen in his hand, scrawling a crude layout of the district. "The new group of workers will attempt to bring the factory's production to a halt."

"Yes, by bombing every establishment and ruining our manpower allocations."

"And once they've done that, they'll force us to the negotiating table, asking for money and more autonomy. But this is not their only objective." Kyle jabbed the tip of the pen towards the prison where research subjects and enslaved prisoners were held. "They want to free their brethren and other prisoners as well, to aid in the upcoming strike."

"That's not possible - the prison and alchemy lab is heavily guarded by our men."

"Not when we have a mole among us. Do you understand?" Kyle stared at Damian, who was slightly confused before realization dawned on him. 

"I understand."

"Good. Then have all men organized as previously ordered, leave the prison minimally defended. Sasha, you know what to do."

[What about Haui?]

"I'll provide him the necessary information so he remains in one piece. He'll know you're coming. Get to work."

Sasha nodded, leaving immediately with her veteran soldiers in tow, while Damian began helming the operations, organizing defensive squads all along the important streets. Kyle watched from his office as his men began to fan out across the district, his plan already coming into effect. He glanced at the list of top union members, memorizing their names and portraits to the best of his ability, along with a copy of their pamphlet and manifesto. 

Kyle scoffed as he read their list of proposed demands. *When one has a hundred years of experience running a criminal organization, union-busting is part and parcel of the job.*

@@@

As dozens upon dozens of Seven Snakes guards poured out into the district, the residents were equally frightened and they scampered for safety, wondering if another war was on the verge of breaking out. Some of the more tenacious ones had nothing to fear, instead drinking their worries away in pubs and watering holes hidden away from the numerous patrols. 

"What's going on, what's happening?" A kid asked as his mother hurriedly carried him into the house, her skirt trailing behind in the smog that drifted through the dark cobblestone streets. "What are those men doing?"

"Keep your head down, dear, it's none of our business, and we'll do well to stay clear." The mother peeked back, watching five Seven Snakes guards armed to the teeth, their metallic Aspis MK1 armour glinting dangerously under the arctech signs that flickered. Their boots clanked against the rough stone as they prowled the streets, searching for union workers or anyone who fit the bill. 

"Fucking Versian rats, can't even keep a job, always asking for this and that." One of the Seven Snakes cobra grunted as he checked an alleyway with his squad members. "Damn factory slaves should just keep their heads down, useless cunts. If they want a better wage, they should've joined the Seven Snakes."

"Damn right, sir." His squad members echoed in acknowledgement, scouring every nook and cranny through the darkest recess of the districts to flush out anyone hiding. The squads entered the slums, noticing many bodies lounging lifelessly against the side of the nearest support, be it a trash pile or a mouldy crate, their eyes staring into vacant space as they laughed to themselves like lunatics. Some of them were clearly factory workers, still wearing their uniform as they rolled about, chasing dreams and frantically flailing in a pool of bile and residual acid from nearby production.

One of the squad members picked up a small flask, a little rainbow-ish green tinge lingering at the bottom of it. "Shit, is this the new drug we've been selling?"

"Effective, no? Making a lot of money with this one. Heard Alex and his team were making a killing distributing this two days ago. One of the kids was off his rockers, testing it." The cobra laughed as he grabbed the chin of a clearly drugged slum dweller, checking the pupils which were dilated far beyond its normal size. 

"Must be having a good time, I wish I was having a good time." A squad member remarked as he aimed his rifle around at the various other dwellers, many of whom were intoxicated. Even kids were lying face up, chuckling at nothing and at each other, the grin on their faces unnatural.

"Better not try this drug, I heard its fifteen times more addictive than the regular doped potions." The cobra warned.

"Well, once this potion spreads wide enough, the union will kill itself in no time. The workers would be-" Instead of completing the sentence, the whizzing sound of a pellet shot past the cobra, cutting off his words. A gurgling sound could be heard, the cobra turning to see the squad member's lower left jaw completely blown off, hanging by a strand of flesh as blood poured out from what remained of his face. 

As the squad member collapsed to the ground, a withering barrage peltered them from all directions, their armour taking a beating. "AMBUSH, GET DOWN!" The cobra roared, a pellet nearly taking his head off, deflecting off his helmet at an angle and ricocheting towards the same drugged dweller, the pellet ripping into his lungs and searing flesh through the friction. The dweller's insane smile still held on his face, even as he bled to death with the firefight raging all around him. 

"Cobra Bosso reporting, we're being ambushed at Brickworks, near the Lusty Arcian! We need help, now!" Bosso roared into his radio as he crawled through the dirt and grime that coated the slum, firing back randomly at the source of the barrage. 

"Where the fuck are they, I can't see them!" 

"Over there, in the rooms above, the balconies!"

"MY ARM! MY ARM!"

"Grr, NIKO YOU FUCKING TWAT, YOU BETTER BE HALFWAY HERE NOW!" Bosso hollered at the top of his lungs into the radio, aiming the iron sights on the tip of his rifle at the balcony, spotting a mere shadow aiming right back at him. 

With fast reflexes, he fired first, the shot blasting right through the union fighter's rifle, causing it to explode brilliantly. The burst of light illuminated the temporary battlefield, revealing the rest of the union fighters, who were hiding amdist the rotten tents made out of disposed clothes, armed with the very same weapons that the Seven Snakes had.

The armor set began to shoot forth green arcia bolts, but it was hardly enough to deal with the sheer amount of pellets whizzing past the alleyway. The point defense arcia engraving was exhausted as soon as the battle began, offering only a brief respite in the opening salvos.

"Fucking shit!" Bosso ducked his heat as suppressing fire went right over him, blanketing the alleyway, his squad breaking up and taking cover wherever they could. Bosso clambered his way behind a pile of decaying corpses, long dead from disability and malnutrition. The pellets thud dully against the cover of flesh and bone, while he gripped the holster of his rifle, checking his fuel belt. 

"COME ON, YA PUNKS, GET SOME!" He bellowed, lifting the rifle above his cover and holding down the trigger, the fuel pipe gurgling with intensity as the repeater unleashed dozens of shots in rapid successions, nailing everything in its path.  Painful screams erupted from the fire, five union fighters falling to the continuous firing, Bosso squeezing even harder only to find that the rifle was not reacting any longer, the barrel overheating from the sheer friction of the rapidfire.

Bosso watched helplessly as another of his squad members was nailed ten times in the chest, the breastplate's ceramic honeycomb shattering apart while his body tumbling to the ground. Before the union fighters could began to surround them, a sudden hailstorm blasted them apart from their flank, ripping their ranks into shreds as they cowered. 

"Bosso! Whatchu doing hiding there like a rat!" Niko grinned as he burst into the battle, cornering the union fighter from behind with his own squad, pinning down the enemy with suppressive fire. 

"Shut up and keep firing until they are all dead!"

All around the district, firefights just like this were breaking out, unfortunate bystanders and residents caught in the crossfire between the associates and the union workers, duking it out for each establishment affilated with the Seven Snakes.

Before long, a resounding explosion was heard before its brilliant light lit up the dark cloudy night sky, an entire building blown apart to pieces, marking the destruction of a Seductive Serpent branch pub and its unlucky inhabitants. As the battle raged on through the night, a team of thirty union fighters snuck their way through the patrols, aiming for something else.

"They are fully distracted now - we should save our brethren. To the prison!" The leader of the union strike force urged, rushing through the backlanes with rifles and arcite explosives. They moved towards an ugly concrete building, the sign of the Alchemist Guild hanging lifelessly. "We know the plan, scour the entire building for the cells. Kill anything that ain't us!"

The union strike force scouted the building, noticing it was lightly defended with a few patrols. Soon, they all suddenly received a notification of sorts on their radio, immediately moving to reinforce the other firefights breaking out all across the city. "Comrade Bronco, something is strange. Look over there! Where are they going?" One of the union fighters scratched his head in confusion as he motioned for the leader to come over.

Instead, he earned a smack to the back of his loosely worn helmet from Bronco. "Idiot, our insider is distracting them for us, quick, get in!" Bronco led the strike force group by group, slowly making their way over to the unguarded entrance. "You two, circle around the back and check for traps or any ambush."

"Yes, Comrade Bronco."

The rest of the strike force swarmed into the building, carefully checking each corner of every hallway, scanning the dilapidated abandoned office rooms before reaching the entrance of the alchemy lab. They formed up against the door, preparing to breach as they could hear movement beyond the doors. While they had the guts, most of them had hardly used a rifle in their lives, some of their hands trembling violently as they gripped the holster. Still, Bronco had no choice but to push forward in the interest of time. "Count of three, rifle blazing. Three, two, one!"

The leader burst into the lab, only to be met with a completely empty lab, the flasks and contraptions all devoid of fluid nor materials, as though they had already evacuated beforehand. "Shit, they knew! It's a trap! Check behind us!"

Yet no ambush came, nothing moved in the deadly silent lab, the strike force on their toes as they fanned out into the empty lab glanced around at each other, even checking back down the hallway through which they came. "Brother, I don't see anything moving!"

"Huh?" The leader was confused, unable to wrap his head around what was happening. *Are they just letting us free them that easily?* 

"Comrade, the prisoners, over there!" One of them pointed to the row of solitary cells, where more than two dozen were shivering and cowering on their beds. The leader shook out of his stupor, immediately ordering his comrades to free them.

"Don't hurt me, I'll do anything, just let me go, please! I'll take the drug, I'll take it!" The panic was clear in the prisoners' eyes as they struggled, even when the union fighters unlocked their cell grills through brute force.

"We're here to break you out, idiot. Now quit yapping and giving our position away or I'll have to gag you myself." Bronco warned, before stuffing a small handkerchief into the prisoner's mouth before the prisoner could reply.

The union strike team was at a loss for words as they rescued the prisoners one by one, noticing the horrifying experiments that was performed here. "Oh, Goddess Nona, what have they done to you?" One of the union fighters knelt down to an obviously convulsing prisoner, who clutched his arm violently with both hands. 

The prisoner's skin hung loosely from his bones, as though he had been malnourished for decades, his gaunt cheeks visible to all as he stared right into the fighters' eyes. "More, I need more, please!"

"More of what?"

"Stop wasting time, we need to get them out of here before the Seven Snakes guards come back!" Bronco hastened them, getting them to move out. "How many prisoners are there here?"

"Only two dozen, there should be more elsewhere." A union fighter replied. "Maybe there's another prison we don't know about."

"No, our insider guaranteed that this was the only prison the Seven Snakes currently have."

"The others are downstairs, other workers who have been imprisoned!" One of the rescued prisoners yelled. "There are hundreds of them!"

"Good, we're going to get them out. Anyone that can fight, take a weapon, now!" Bronco armed the prisoners who were still capable of moving, while leaving a squad to protect the unconscious and immobilized ones. 

As they navigated the building, they soon found the basement that had been half-converted into a dungeon, though it was far more clean and sterile than the usual prison, as if it were a research facility. 

A single hallway that extended into the distance, with each cell holding more than twenty of their union workers, other thugs and petty criminals who had been captured by the Seven Snakes over the last three months, many languishing away in torment with them sharing a single shit bucket, the stench overwhelming. Large exhaust vents dotted the walls, helping to circulate fresh air from the surface through giant fans.

"HELP US, SAVE US!" One of the prisoners screamed, clutching at the grills that imprisoned them.

"We're on it. Comrades, break down the doors!"

The union fighters slammed and shot off the hinges, freeing them by the dozens as they all scampered and screamed for joy. "The other cells, deeper in! You three, hold the exit until we've freed all of them." The leader ordered, leading the charge as the small strike force built into a hungry mob, desiring revenge. 

Before long, all of the prisoners were freed, many hugging each other and crying tears of joy, freed from the slave labour and human experimentation they had been subjected to. "To the exit, quickly!"

"Not so fast, my friends." A unknown voice echoed down the single hallway, the voice garbled through a filter. "I can't have my precious research subjects leave that easily. Not without a parting gift. A field test needs to be properly prepared for, after all."

Bronco turned to see a lab coat alchemist at the end of the hallway, wearing what seemed to be a plague masks, the glasses flickering under the sterile white arctech light. 

"Alchemist Haui, you little fucker, shoot him!" Bronco and the union fighters held no hesitation, immediately aiming at Haui only for a sudden blur slashing through them like a whirlwind. He could only see the facade of a woman, twirling a glittering falchion that sliced through the barrels of the rifles like butter, dismantling them in just a few seconds. Leaping back away from the throng of prisoners, the woman stared at them while flicking the blood of her blade, a small grin on her face. 

"My hand, she cut my hand off!" A union worker yelled in pain as he doubled over, many of the fighters now realizing their right hand had been sliced off through the flesh and bone, the interior exposed to the elements while the sliced rifles fell helplessly to the ground, broken in half.

"She's just one girl, beat her up and the Alchemist!" Bronco roared over the wails of the maimed fighters, leading the charge with the prisoners following in tow. 

Haui tossed Sasha another gas mask, her putting it on calmly as she watched the throng of prisoners and union workers rush at her. < Shue, Yul, Uryag, Nemoon > Sasha spoke in with a silky voice, the falchion in her right hand glowing brilliantly, the large Dzi Flower Sand jewels embedded in it surging with energy that travelled up her veins. 

Before the first prisoner could reach Sasha, the exhaust vents suddenly slammed shut, the panes all locked tightly, before a sickening blue smoke began to erupt in copious amounts, blasting them from all angles. Haui chuckled under the mask as he watched the prisoners and union workers began to choke on the fumes entering their lungs. 

"It's a trap! This.. this is Euria smoke!" Bronco gagged as he took yet another involuntary breath. He glanced upwards, peering through the dense blue smoke only to see the bright blade of the falchion shining through the fog menacingly. He watched in horror as with every swing and slash, another man lost his hand, the piercing shrieks of pain echoing through the narrow tight hallway. "Retreat, retreat!"

The originally united throng began to panic, scrambling for the only exit behind as Sasha cut down hand after hand. A union fighter bravely drew a spare handgun against her, only for his hand to be sliced cleanly through the muscles, flesh and bone, the nerves exposed to the stinging Euria fumes as he fell backwards. 

"Better start running, if you stay here, you'll lose more than just a hand." Haui called out from behind while Sasha hunted each one of them brave enough to fight back. Those who made it out of the basement found themselves flanked on all sides by Sasha's veteran soldiers, who had them encircled on all ends save for a few gaps.

"Don't fight them, just run, get out!" The leader ordered, panic clear in his voice as they scampered out of the office building, fleeing in every direction where the soldiers were not. Nearly all of them were maimed in someway or another, having lost a hand, or being shot in the thighs or losing their feet, hoisted to safety by their comrades.

The survivors ran as fast as they could, only regrouping half an hour later at a pre-planned location. "How many did we lose in there?" Bronco coughed out blue smoke as he started counting heads, his face growing in slight disbelief at the sheer number of prisoners and union fighters who made it out. There were now nearly three hundred total gathered here. "No one? We didn't lose a single person? How can that be? I..."

"It's a success, comrade!" One of the fighters cheered. "The prisoners have been freed!" The rest joined in the cheering, celebrating prematurely with shouts of joy and victory. However, Bronco was far from convinced it was a successful operation. 

*They could have killed or captured all of us in there, but yet they let us go. But why?*

# Chapter 87 - Revolution

[Wages, safety and unity!]

"Wages, safety and unity!"

[Wages, safety and unity!]

"Wages, safety and unity!"

Arctech radio chanted protest slogans as a general strike was called the very next morning, the entire district grinding to a halt as hundreds upon hundreds of workers took to the streets, marching towards the factory with pickets and signs. "FREE US FROM SLAVERY!" They called out, their advance indomitable. A few of them were clearly missing hands and limbs, being supported by their comrades as they protested for a better future. 

They moved through pellet-ridden streets, burning wagon wrecks and destroyed storefronts, the remnants of burnt-out buildings from the rigged explosions left standing as a charred husk, countless bodies burnt black with no one to collect them.  Culo glanced at the wreckage with astonishment at the brutality of last night's conflict. "I thought we were supposed to blow up the Seven Snakes, not innocent residents."

"Now is not the time for reluctance. Their deaths were an unfortunate collateral, a result of the fierce fighting between the Seven Snakes and us that resulted in this botched explosion. They were not meant to die, but their sacrifice will be remembered in the new world that is to come."

Culo nodded, but in his heart he wondered if that was truly the case. Still, the invigorating chants from his comrades and other workers buoyed his resolve and buried his doubts.

Gunther grinned as he watched the masses move according to his will, advancing together as one. "This is it, this is the revolution. And you, Culo - you will get to see everything happen in your own eyes."

"But will the Seven Snakes agree to our demands?"

"They may not. They will try to negotiate, to haggle their way out just like the pigs they are. But instead of compromising, we will stand our ground and not budge a single inch. They are the ones who need us, not them."

"If both sides do not budge, there will be no jobs."

"And so what? Better a life of revolution than a life of half-assed contradictions. These pigs should not and will not be treated diplomatically - they are the source of all our problems, a disease upon society. Now that the masses truly know how evil they are, we can finally bring about true change within the Yual Dominion."

"Just like Versia."

"Exactly. One coup was example enough for us to know its possible. Every Versian knows that, and you and I are the leaders of this new revolution in Raktor." Gunther patted Culo on the back as they marched on, surrounded by fellow factory workers.

Even those who were originally not part of the union joined in the strike, the protest building up critical mass as they approached the factory, its towering chimneys looming over them while two rows of Seven Snakes guards formed up, blocking their path. 

"You're not getting any further than this, fuckers!" Niko roared over the din of slogan chanting. "Anyone who crosses this line will earn a pellet to the head!"

"You're not the only one with guns, bitch!" A worker called out, with dozens of union workers brandishing rifles, aiming them right back at the Seven Snakes guards and Niko. 

A tense standoff occurred as the protestors shoved against the line of guards, trying to break through and occupy the factory. Niko began barking orders to try and control the situation. "Cover that backlane and shore up that gap! I want fifty men with shields on that corner. Bosso, get your fucking squad over there now and push them back!"

"WAGES, SAFETY AND UNITY! WAGES, SAFETY AND UNITY!" The protestors raged, violently pushing the guards backwards as Niko began to sweat a little, faced with the seemingly endless horde of workers. 

"The only way you can stop this is to get your fucking boss down here to negotiate!" Culo roared at Niko. 

"Like fucking hell a shitface like you is going to talk to the Boss of all people! He would never -" Niko's rant was interrupted by an order on the arctech radio, his face paling at what he was hearing. "Damian, you can't be fucking serious. If we let them in, we... you're joking. This is complete bullshit! What the hell have we been- fine. But if this goes sideways it ain't my fault."

Niko stuffed the arctech radio back onto his belt. "Retreat! Retreat back to the shopping arcade."

The guards stared at him blankly, but quickly complied, none of them really wanting to match the crowd head-on themselves no matter how bloodthirsty they were. Even the most violent among them knew they wouldn't come out unscathed. The moment Niko retreated, The protestors rushed forward like a surging tide, quickly occupying the factory in droves, swarming every room and space on the factory floor. 

"We did it! We actually have control!" Culo cheered with the rest of the workers, all of whom bore wide grins on their faces as they shook hands and threw hats into the air.

"It's not over yet. They could try to flush us out with that damn Euria smoke..." Bronco wheezed badly, his face slightly pale. "I wouldn't put it past those fucking gangster to try everything!"

"They won't. And if they do, it would only worsen their reputation. Now we just wait for them to come to the negotiating table." Gunther took up residence in Gordon's office, which had been hastily evacuated. He flipped through the designs of the weapons and the armour, ordering one of his followers to keep a copy of them for themselves. 

"Gunther, what are you doing? If we use those designs, we'll be slaughtered by the nobles themselves. Those are military grade weapons!" Culo warned with anxiety in his voice.

"Culo, authority comes from force. How can you expect to negotiate with those who oppress us on a level playing field without having the same equipment that they possess. A maggot cannot negotiate with a goblin. We'll have a few days to prepare before they try to strike again, and then it will be a week until they come to bargain with us once they realize they cannot flush us-"

"Comrade Gunther, the boss - the boss of the Seven Snakes is here to negotiate!" Another member of the council informed them, stunning Gunther into an awkward silence. Many of the council members were flabbergasted as well, having never seen Gunther stumped like this. For most of the last month, every single word that Gunther had said all came to fruition, but yet this was clearly an unexpected turn of events.

"That's not right. This shouldn't be happening... the boss of the Seven Snakes is a known profiteer who only seeks monetary gains..." Gunther tried to rationalize what was happening. "They should be only compromising a week later at best. Are you sure its them?"

"Yes, sir. He's here with the underboss Damian and a lady with a weird glittering sword." The mention of the magical falchion traumatized Bronco, who began to breath erratically. 

At the base of the factory floor, the workers began to part aside, avoiding the trio who walked through them fearlessly and with sheer confidence, Kyle leading the way with Damian and Sasha in tow. Some even began to doubt that the strike would be a success, knowing the three of them were far too strong. 

Damian towered over everyone like a hulking giant in a modified Aspis MK1 armour suited just for him, along with a large custom-made tower shield strapped to his back. On the other side, Sasha still had bloodstains from the night before, rumors of her callous slaughter spreading like wildfire among the freed prisoners into the protestors.

"I'm here to negotiate. Who is the union leader?" Kyle asked, glaring at the workers nearby who all cowered in fear, many knowing what the boss was capable of. 

"That would be me." 

Kyle glanced up to see Gunther standing at the top of a metallic stairwell leading to the head office. "Good, let us negotiate inside." Kyle was about to head up when Gunther chuckled. 

"Negotiate? Inside? There is no 'negotiation'. There are only demands. And you will adhere to each and everyone of them, right in front of all of my comrades and brothers here. No more dealing in the shadows." Gunther smirked, looking down upon Kyle.

*Intimidation Aura!*

A sudden burst of pressure erupted from Kyle, the workers all trembling and backpedalling as far away from Kyle as they could. Even Gunther began to sweat a little, his heart palpitating wildly while he tried to understand what was happening. 

"Then you best come down here." Kyle motioned with his hand towards Gunther, pointing towards the ground. Out of fear, Gunther descended the stairwell, finally coming eye to eye with Kyle, his body shivering even more as he got even closer to the source. 

Suddenly, the pressure was lifted, the workers all confused and staring at each other in shock. Gunther panted heavily as he dropped to one knee while Kyle smirked down at him. "That's better. Now we are on the same level. Well? What are the demands? I'm listening."

Gunther gritted his teeth, scrambling back up to his full height with resolve. "You think you can toy with us? Here's our demands - relinquish managerial control of the factory to us, all workers are to be unionized under me, all shifts reduced to eight hours just like before, and wages increased double that of market prices! And no more fucking children on the factory floor."

"Done. You have my word."

"And don't try to bargain with us, I will not budge a single - huh?" Gunther was caught off-guard, the workers around astounded, some frantically digging their ears to hear better.

"I said I agree to all your demands. You have control of the factory now, and I will inform Gordon of the new arrangements. The wages will be paid according to the maximum capacity of the factory as of this very moment."

"What?" The workers couldn't believe what they've just heard, assuming the boss of the Seven Snakes would be an uncompromising monster that they would have to fight tooth and nail with. Suddenly all of the tension and excitement was deflated like a popped balloon as a wave of excited murmurs spread through the crowd, the workers at the far end equally astonished at what was happening.

"You're lying." Gunther stared pointedly, earning a small chuckle from Kyle.

"I'm not. Your demands are effective this very hour. Gordon will make sure of it. I will pull all Seven Snakes guards back from the factory. Anything else?"

"..." Gunther was at a complete loss for words, unable to utter even a reply, his mind racing with all the possible motives as he looked at the confident Kyle, who seemed to be dictating the playing field.

"Well then, I have places to be. Good discussion. I look forward to a prosperous relationship in the future." Kyle turned sharply, his coat flicking in the air as he left as quickly as he had arrived, leaving the protestors in a state of shock. 

An awkward silence reigned in the air, bated breaths waiting for Kyle and his men to leave the factory. "We... we did it? WE DID IT!" Culo roared at the top of his lungs, the protestors and workers cheering in unison, hugging each other. "We got everything we ever dreamed of, and its all thanks to you, Gunther! That Kyle guy wasn't so bad after all!"

"Don't count your fresils before they glow!" Gunther warned, storming back up to the head office, where the council was already celebrating in full force, shouting with every ounce of energy they had and ravaging any alcohol that had been hidden away by the managers. "Calm down, you idiots. That fucking pig must have something up his sleeve, I'm sure of it!"

He ordered the workers to keep an eye out, but true enough to his words, each and every demand was entertained fully. The managers had all pulled out, with Gordon confirming Kyle's orders to double the wages and reduce the shifts. Every foreman was now under the union and morale was soaring across the factory. 

"That's awesome, we got the dream job now!" Culo clenched his fist in victory before glaring at Gordon angrily. "No thanks to you and your managers." 

"Need I explain to you again that the whole reason why we were pushing you all so hard was because we have a clear production deadline to meet!" Gordon reminded them angrily. "Your wages will only last as long as the contract is active - failing to meet the contract will result in the factory going bust! If that happens, you can say goodbye to your job. "

"Not a problem. Our brothers and comrades are more than skilled to operate the factory and take a bigger pie of the contract!" Gunther retorted sharply, confident in the prowess of the new union.

Word was spread quickly, the double wages invigorating them more to do their part. Now that the workers knew that they were getting paid their worth, they had a far higher morale, especially knowing that the others were all in the same union, their rights protected. The hours were reduced to eight hours just like before and machines were repaired without fatality or injury. 

While Culo worked on the assembly lines with a wide grin on his face, joking with the other members on his team, Gunther was still pacing the office nervously, clearly bothered by how weird Kyle was acting. "This can't be, this can't be right, we had it all planned out..." He mumbled to himself quietly, ignoring the celebrations erupting all around him.

As Gunther dealt with his own internal disarray, Culo poured over the finances and production targets, realizing Gordon was not joking about the targets. It was a tall order to begin with, and while he could not forgive the callousness of the managers, he could at least sympathize with what they had to deal with. Now, the council was in full control of the wages and positions, allocating jobs to the workers en-masse. 

However, it didn't take an hour for the first obstacle to appear in their path without even a full day passing: there were way more workers than there were jobs. 

"Why am I not allowed to be the foreman, but you get to be it?! I fought just as hard as you and I deserve a job, hand or no hand!" One of the freed prisoners complained, waving his stubbed arm around as a sign of his valor. 

"You're disabled, you can't possibly work the line! Etching and sanding requires both hands for maximum stability!" The foreman tried to reason with the freed prisoners, many of whom were clearly maimed and unfit for the tough requirements of arcia etching and machine operating. 

"Really?! We fought tooth and nail, even suffered for the cause, and now we get tossed aside like cattle? You're no different from the pigs that we just got rid off!"

"Everyone, calm down, calm down!" Culo tried to interject. "Look, I'm sure we can find a role for all of you, definitely. I'll talk to the union council and see what we can do for you." 

Despite the doubling of wages, the council was already at a loss on what to do. "The thing is, when one of our brothers were to be imprisoned, the factory hired an additional one to replace him. Now that we have freed all of them, there are more than enough hands to go around, but if we do so, we won't be able to pay all of them the promised double wages!" A council member explained the dilemma. 

"What?" Culo was confused. "Didn't Kyle agree to pay double wages?"

"Only up to the maximum capacity of the factory!" Gordon rolled his eyes in clear disdain. "Were you not listening? As if anyone in the world is simply going to pay you double just because you hired a few hundred useless people right off the bat."

"You!" Culo stormed up to Gordon, jabbing his finger into his chest. "You're a fucking monster - they aren't useless, it's because of them that we got to where we are today."

"Sure, but you and I both know where they'll bring you to tomorrow." Gordon sneered, earning a right hook from Culo that sent him sprawling to the ground. 

"Fucking cunt." Culo spat on Gordon's chest. "We should do our best to at least rotate the roles. Maybe have it such that people don't work all seven days of the week. This way, everyone still get some wages in some way, isn't that right, Gunther? Gunther? Where did he go?"

The council looked around only to find him completely missing. "Last I saw him he said he was going out to pick up a package." Bronco motioned with his thumb out through the office door, while he fumbled with a satchel of Euria Seeds pilfered from the stores of the managers. 

Culo squinted his eyes at him in suspicion. "What are you doing with that?"

"I'm going to smoke it, what else?"

"Since when do you smoke? Hell, you used to be part of the Crusaders against Vices! What would Angela say?"

"Fuck if I care about her, it was here free for the taking. Or what, you're the leader of the council now? I thought we were all equals here!" 

Culo fumed internally, wanting to lash out at the obvious hypocripsy, though he noticed the strike force's leader hand shivering slightly. "Fine. Either way, we will make sure the factory runs, smoothly and safely. Got it?"

While the council desperately worked round the clock to get the factory in order, Gunther was moving quickly away from the factory, hiding himself with a hood away from the prying looks of passerbys and residents, disguising as a shabby homeless man once more. 

As he entered the backlanes, walking with purpose, he soon approached a nondescript metal box that was locked tight. A simple key from his pocket cracked it open, revealing an arctech radio within, with a coaster that had a series of numbers written on it. However, instead of following the instructions, he tuned the radio to a completely different set. As the connection was established, Gunther was already whispering angrily into the receiver. "You told me they didn't have enough money! That they wouldn't negotiate! You fucked my entire plan!"

[They don't! I'm sure of it, I checked all of the finances personally myself!]

"Then how the fuck are they affording to pay double the wages when I just blew up five of their fucking establishments? They aren't even charging the workers rent in the housing complex!"

[I don't know! I really don't!]

"On the Goddess name, you better find out what Kyle is up to, or else both you and me are screwed!" Gunther hung up, before staring down at the coaster with the set of numbers, wondering what his next step should be. *I must figure out what is going on, before I am ensnared by anything and anyone. It's best if I keep all the cards close to my chest instead of-*

He suddenly froze in place for a brief moment, only to suddenly feel a startling presence behind him, instantly twisting around to deliver a kick. Instead of hearing a satisfying thud, his heel was stopped short of the man's face, gripped tightly in place before he was flung unceremoniously into the nearest trash pile. Gunther shrugged off the grime, only to see three men approach him, the leader grinning widely.

"Quite the welcome. Is this how you repay us?"

"Fuck you, Wrent. I don't answer to you."

"Seems like you don't want to answer to anyone. I was wondering when you were going to inform us of your successful strike."

"I took down the damn factory, just like we agreed upon. I've already done my part."

"Nope." Wrent wagged his finger, playing with the hilt of his red sword hinged on his belt. "The deal was clear between Leo, me and you. Humiliate the Seven Snakes beyond restoration and crater their economy."

"Once the factory fails the contract, their reputation will already be down the drain."

"Ah, but there's a better way to disgrace their image. You have quite a few weapons and armour on you, no? Perhaps you could get some more. You see, despite Kyle's unlikeable traits, the Aspis MK1 armour and rifle he made is quite useful both to us and Count Leon. It is indeed a leap of technology."

Gunther glared with suspicion. "What do you want?"

"It's simple, really. I want the factory production on the same schedule as before, but all weapons and armour diverted to the Red Lions."

"You're mad, you're asking me to be killed by the Seven Snakes! I'm not ready, I-"

"What does your life or death matter to me? And if you're thinking of running... we already both know how that played out before. Leo can grab you just as easily as before."

Gunther cursed under his breath as Wrent laughed, turning around to leave with his men. "Have the crates delivered to my district, I'll handle the rest."

"Big fucking talk for a man who lost to twenty Seven Snakes." Gunther grinned as he recovered to his full height. 

Wrent stopped dead in his tracks, looking back over his shoulder with a fearsome glare. "What did you say?"

"I said -" Before Gunther could finish, three red waves slashed violently across his thighs, toppling him over in a burst of blood. He gritted his teeth, resisting the urge to scream as Wrent slowly walked to him. 

Wrent bent down to the bleeding Gunther, grabbing his cheeks and dragging his head up to eye-level. "If you ever mention that again, I will let the world see what a revolutionary looks like on the inside out, limb by limb. First I'll start with your fingers, and carve my name on each and every joint while it's still connected. Then I'll rip the toenails and sear them with an etcher for fifty days. And forget about Leo hunting you down - I'll be the one to chase you if you leave the city, even to Tenar. I'm far different from the man I used to be when I lost to the Seven Snakes, and you can be the first to find out just how much has changed. Are we clear?" 

"Yes...sir."

"Good." Wrent dropped him to the floor again, tossing a health potion that clattered on the blood-stained cobblestone. "Always charmed to meet you. Remember - every day, fifty crates by dusk. That, or we could have another conversation like this that might be a bit more physical."

Gunther clenched his fist, reaching out for the health potion as Wrent and his men disappeared, melding into the throng of pedastrians who hardly cared for the homeless looking man bleeding out in the backlane. He chugged the potion, his wounds healing rapidly, though he was still dizzy from the blood loss. 

He staggered to his feet, limping slightly back towards the factory as he ditched the stained disguise. The celebration was still in full swing, workers cheering and relaxing in the lunch canteen and all around the factory floor, joking with each other. As he returned to the council office, Culo was the first to notice a bit of bloodstain on the edge of Gunther's sleeves and pants, but Culo held his tongue. 

"Have we organized the workers?" Gunther resumed his strong resolute self.

"We're working out the kinks now, but Culo had a brilliant suggestion of having everyone split their shifts up. This way, we can hire everyone in the union, but each individual works less. It's a great way to -"

"No. If we want more workers, expand the assembly lines. I want the extra workers working on the new lines as soon as possible. Everyone works, seven days a week, eight hour shifts. The factory has to be running round the clock." 

The council stared at Gunther in slight shock. "Gunther, what the hell are you talking about?"

"If we want to keep our wages, we will need to match the production contract, just like Gordon said. This is the only way we can maintain the results of our demands."

"But the wages, they won't be doubled if we hire everyone full time! The deal with Kyle was that he pays the wages for the current maximum capacity right now, not in the future!"

"So be it. At least the union has control over how the factory is being ran. What's the current treasury of the factory?"

"Uhm... just enough to buy the materials and pay wages to last another week of production." A council member reported. 

"Then we have no choice. I will forgo my wages, and we will need to in order to purchase new equipment for the additional assembly lines."

"You're talking about docking our pay just as we had it doubled?! This won't go well with the workers!" 

"We don't have a choice, not if we want to keep things this way. This arrangement will only last until we get the payment of the contract in. Have the finances be transparent to all workers in the factory, make sure everyone is on the same page."

While Gunther was essentially recommending the same working pace as the managers before him, Culo still appreciated that Gunther was being upfront about the reason why, though he still had a bit of lingering doubt as to what bloodied the edges of Gunther's outfit when he went out. 

As the council began to spring into action, Gunther pulled Bronco aside for a private conversation. "Brother Bronco, are you with me?"

"Till the end, Brother Ki Hwang. You know this."

"I need you to divert some production to the arming of our brothers. Our true brothers, not the leeches who tagged along. There are forces that seek to profit of us and what we have accomplished so far, and I'll be damned if I let that happen again." Gunther explained the deal with Wrent.

Bronco nodded in understanding, knowing that Leo had captured Gunther and him before multiple times. But this time was different. This time, they had a weapons factory. "We won't let the damn Red Lions catch us off-guard again. This time, when they come for us, we'll be armed to the teeth." Bronco grinned.

Gunther gripped Bronco's hand firmly, an unbreakable bond forged from their days in Versia. "So those above remember their roots."

"So they shall return to dust."
# Chapter 88 - Same Old Routine

The week went past in a blur for Culo, as the factory began an even tighter and stricter production strategy while setting up new assembly lines. While the hours had been reduced, and there were far less fatalities than before, he still couldn't shake the feeling that they were now worse off than before. 

"Weren't we fighting for a better work-life balance and what not?" His team member remarked to him as they etched what seemed to be the umpteenth rifle barrel, following the grooves of the guide like second nature. "Why do I feel like I'm working harder than ever, and it's not like we're getting paid more too!"

Culo had nothing to rebut with, glancing over to the new assembly lines where there were a significant majority of workers who had missing hands and feet, unable to do their task as efficiently as the others. Many fumbled with the etcher clumsily, some even resorting to crudely implemented contraptions that strapped the etcher to their stubbed arm in a desperate attempt to remain relevant. Many of them could not find another job within the factory, especially given their low educational level and lack of understanding.

It would be wrong of him to think lowly of them - they had fought as hard as he did for the union. Culo shrugged in response to his team member's words, focusing on his works, the tight deadline and finances looming over his head more than ever *Am I even more stressed now?* 

"At least the council is living up to their expectations." The team member grunted. "Not like those fuckers taking up perfectly fine jobs that could be given to others... have they not seen how many migrants are out there queuing for a job like we had in the past?"

"Hey, they sacrificed their body and soul to get our brothers out of the prison." Culo retorted.

However, he instead earned a nudge from another team member beside him. "Hey, uhh, you know it was mostly other thugs and criminals in those prisons right?"

"So what? We're all working towards the same goals."

"See for yourself, mate." The team member pointed towards a corner of the assembly line, where a freed thug was clearly snoring soundly, skiving off his job. In fact, as Culo took a closer look, he started to notice the thugs acting like they were working hard, but in effect doing nothing, earning a paycheck for free. 

"What the fuck?" Culo slammed his etcher down onto the table, storming over to the sleeping thug and smacking him awake. "How the fuck are you sleeping on the job? We got deadlines to meet! Were you not listening during the morning briefing?!"

"Huh? Who the fuck are you?!" The thug clutched his bruised cheeks, glancing around before realizing it was just a scrawny young man in front of him. "Oh, you're the kid on the council. What, gonna boss me around?"

"I'm not bossing you around, I'm telling you, if you wanna hold a job, you better work for it!"

"Fine, fine, geez. Got a goblin up your arse or something? What a loser." The thug dug his ears in irritation, returning back to his work reluctantly and etching haphazardly, without using the guiding sample. Even Culo was able to see that it would not past any form of quality test. "There, you happy now? Or if you wanna pick a fight, me and my bois will be more than willing to oblige."

Culo clenched his fist, but returned to his position without causing additional fuss. He bottled up his emotions, the team members next to him keeping their heads low to avoid the thug's gaze. His council position was utterly useless if the new workers themselves did not truly believe in the union. "Leeches, the lot of them." He muttered under his breath as he continued his etching. 

"Damn right, now we're working extra to make up for their shoddy work. Why the fuck can't we just fire them?" Another worker whispered to his buddy.

"Idiot, they are part of the union now too! What would it look like if we tried to fire one of our own?" 

"He's clearly jeopardizing the production targets, that should be grounds to get him out!"

"Only the council can do it, but judging from how Culo was treated, I got a feeling it won't be that easy."

Culo ignored the whispers around him, his eyes focused on the etching right in front of him. *Dream job my ass. Now I'm a babysitter who is not even respected.* The rest of the workers watched as the thugs and other prisoners joked and laughed. And while no one had any other outburst of rage like Culo did, the writing on the wall was clear as day: nobody liked getting paid unequally.

What was even worse was the finances of the factory made public by the council. Any worker who walked past the entrance or changing room were met with multiple copies of the weekly production targets required of them in order to maintain their job. No one wanted to lose what they had fought so hard to earn, yet the baggage that they were now forced to drag along out of moral goodwill was beginning to strain relationships among the workers. 

A council meeting was naturally called to address the issue, but it was scheduled at night, after the day shift was completed. At the end of his day shift, Culo's body fatigued as ever before, dreading the meeting as his mind tried to resolve the conflict within. He lumbered back home, towards the housing complex, completely out of energy . *I still got to meet with the council later before I can sleep, and I need the team to produce 50% faster over the next week. This is just fucking... huh?* 

As he approached his shared apartment, two familiar workers counting a wad of rakels brushed past his shoulder violently, clearly having just left his room with a wide grin on their faces. Culo rubbed his shoulder while observing their backs, before noticing they had a very familiar looking ring in their hands. "HEY! What the fuck are you doing with my ring?!"

"Huh? You talking to us?"

"Yea, I'm talking to you. Who let you into my room? Give it back!"

"Who else? Your roommate. He sold this ring to us, said it was his."

"Well it's not. You better give it back or -" As soon as Culo spoke those words, his wrist was grabbed, his body thrown against the ugly concrete walls of the dim hallway forcibly, pinned. 

"Or what?" The worker fiddled with the ring in his hand while his partner rained blow after blow on Culo, Culo blocking with his arm as best as he could, searching for a way out. With a swift motion, Culo kicked out, slamming his shin into the shin of the partner, sending him stumbling backwards as Culo propped himself up against the wall unsteadily, only to face the barrel of a handgun. 

"Aight, kid. You got punk. Say, aren't you that young council guy?"

"And you guys are fellow union workers. Give back the damn ring!" Culo gritted his teeth, raising his hands into a fighting posture. 

"Like hell I'm going to leave without getting paid!" The worker aimed the handgun right at Culo's forehead, but Culo was unintimidate, his resolve steeled. 

"Don't you know this whole complex is guarded by the Seven Snakes?" Culo tried to reason. "If you start a fight, you'll be imprisoned by them!"

The worker and his partner glanced at each other, before breaking out into raucous laughter. "Oh, he's so cute! I wish I could put him in my pocket. Thank god the council is naive as fuck."

"What the hell are you two laughing about? I'm serious?"

"You really believe the Seven Snakes guards are coming to help you? Idiot, the doubling of wages to the factory forced them to reduce the amount of guards here in the complex! I even heard they all got sent far away for some reason. It's a free for all now - we might as well rule this place. I could shoot you right now and stuff your body away hidden for two weeks before the stench calls someone over." The worker chortled. "But you're a good guy, I'll prefer if it not comes to that." 

"You-"

"Don't test me, I will shoot. You won't be the first."

Culo was frozen on the spot, his eyes locked on the ring as he weighed whether his life was really worth risking for it. Flashes of his brother and village back in Ocra clouded his vision, eventually forcing him to relent and relax his posture.

"Good kid. Seeing as you're council, you'll probably have us fired from the factory tomorrow. But hey, see if I give a shit, I can pawn this ring for ten days' wages and make even more selling the new stuff!" The worker and his partner laughed as they retreated back down the stairwell, leaving a raging Culo behind who instantly stormed into the room, finding a ravaged and messy room unlike how he had left it this morning. His personal belongings were strewn all over the floor, each and every valuable piece laid for all to see. 

"Hyul, what the fuck are you doing?! You sold my ring? Are you fucking out of your mind?" Culo was about to give his roommate a piece of his mind, but his roommate was unresponsive, a dreamy smile plastered unnaturally on his face while an empty potion flask was still gripped tightly in his hand. The clearly drugged roommate's eyes wandered the walls, grinning at each and every speck of dust that seemed to come to life.

Of course, to the sober Culo, all this was simply insane. "Hyul? Hey?" 

Culo glanced at the empty potion flask, the smell instantly recognizable. *Fuck, it's that new mindtwister that's been going around!* He grabbed his roommate by the collar, shaking him violently and slapping him twice to no avail. It was this very moment that Culo felt entirely helpless, the precious ring that his parents had left him as a reminder now pawned off to an unknown fate. 

Whatever lingered of his naive view of the union was slowly breaking down when he packed his things into the same small briefcase he had when he first arrived and shifted out. It was far too dangerous for him to remain here, especially with a addicted roommate. As he descended the floors, he could see fights and drugs dealt all over the housing complex coupled with prostitute girls staring him down, showing no oversight at all from any guards or enforcers. 

Culo watched helplessly as other union workers leveraged their position to rob or drug other union workers, stealing anything of value. Instead of the union uniting the workers, they had instead bandied into small thug groups, relishing in the power vacuum by the retreat of the Seven Snakes. Soon, Culo found a lone Seven Snakes patrol squad, idling near the entrance of the housing complex. "Hey, hey! I need help, I just got robbed!"

"Huh?" The cobra leading the squad stared vacantly at Culo running up to him.

"Yea, two big guys, one bald and missing his front two tooth along with a hand, the other having a grey beard with a scar on his left eye."

"Right... like that narrows it down. Are they union workers?"

"Well, yes, but what does that matte-"

"Orders from above are to not mess with the union. Don't want to risk another general strike fucking over the whole district, you know? Better to stay out of the way, else I'll get transferred to the boonies to god knows what shitty slave factory."

"But-"

"You guys chose this, don't blame us. We ain't your babysitters. And aren't you a council member? Sort your own shit out instead of running to us."

Culo was left standing alone on the crowded street just outside the complex, bustling with activity, yet he never felt so alone before, not even when he first arrived to Raktor. The sad reality of the union was beginning to crack his dreams while he lugged his briefcase along, thinking of where to move to. *I could move to one of the union hideout, at least I'm safer there... or am I?* Both his roommate and the worker who stole his ring was union too, diminishing his belief in the unity of the union. 

As he wandered aimlessly down the street, a slightly familiar face noticed him and waved at him. Culo couldn't recall his name, but knew he was an old hand from the previous factory before the refurbishment, one of the original foreman. 

"Hey, Culo, right?"

"Yea?" Culo stared warily as he clutched the handle of briefcase even tighter, ready to fight at a moment's notice. 

"Yea, wanted to ask if- hold on, what got you so tense? What's with all the baggage? You moving house?"

"What's it to you?"

"Hey, hey, hey, calm down, I ain't out to hurt you or anything! What happened?" The genuine look of concern on the foreman's face soften Culo's stance a little. 

"Nothing, just, looking for a place to stay. My roommate just sold one of my family heirlooms for a fucking drug."

"Shit...that bad, huh?" The foreman scratched his head awkwardly, glancing around. "Say, uhh wanna move to my place? I don't have a lot myself, but I got a spare bed you can crash on for the night while you figure things out."

"What are you aiming at?"

"Nothing, just offering. Well, if you don't want it, I'll just be on my way, then. Hope you find a place, I'll just ask my question tomorrow."

"Just shoot, I'm listening."

"Right... I wanted to ask you what the council was going to do about the lazy bums in the new assembly lines. I'm their foreman, but I can't get to move or budge or do a single thing properly! Half of the gear produced is shoddy and needs to be reworked. I don't wanna look bad to the council and have my job cut, so I was hoping if you could speak up for me."

"I will, I understand what you're saying perfectly." 

"Great, thank you, I really need that job, I got a wife and kid to feed, you know, usual stuff. Thanks again!" The foreman shook Culo's hand vigorously, before making his way home. 

"Say, that bed still up for grabs?" Culo called out after the foreman, opening up a bit.

"Sure thing, anything for a council member!" The foreman nodded, motioning for Culo to follow him. The duo walked through the crowded street under the street lights, watching as bits and pieces of lawlessness that Culo had never seen before slowly creep into the district. Roaming thug gangs were already starting to assert territory, claiming protection money from frightened store owners under the guise of the union. 

He could already hear the angry mutterings of bystanders as they watched yet another store owner have his display smashed to bits. "I don't like to say this, but at least the Seven Snakes had the best interest of the district at heart. Look at this mess, I much rather they come back than have the union in control!" A lady murmured to her friend as they walked hurriedly by, acting like they never saw a thing.

"The Seven Snakes are still here, but they are only protecting their businesses. They are afraid of antagonizing the union anymore - spineless, if you ask me."

"Can you blame them? They did try to wipe out the union, but it backfired heavily. If I were them I wouldn't risk a fight, especially not when they have their own armed force. The union is basically a new gang in itself!"

Culo couldn't disagree, not with everything he had witnessed so far. However, he no longer tried to intervene, instead keeping his mouth shut and trudging along silently with the foreman, who also gazed at the sight with a hopeless expression. They soon reached his house, a quaint little apartment right at the end of Thresher Street, above a erotica bookstore that had eerie moaning sounds wafting through the mouldy holes of the wooden plank floor. 

"I thought you said you have a wife and kids?" Culo questioned as he was greeted with a clearly messy house, full of bottles of alcohol lingering about and an unkept couch. 

"I do. They are just.... uh... not staying here at the moment."

"Disagreement?"

"Very much so. Well, then, make yourself at home."

Culo smiled, but shifted his collar nervously. "Sorry, you're doing so much for me but I seemed to have forgotten your name."

"Ah, I'm Karl. Long timer of the factory. How could you forget my name when I was the one who trained you?!"

"Sorry, sorry, its just been a crazy two months." Culo put down his briefcase, collapsing into the couch, uncaring about the obvious stench of beer and whiskey permeating the air. "I thought we won the world last week, but it seems like such things are always too good to be true."

"You know it. I've been working in this line for a few decades now, seen my fair share of societies, guilds, unions and what not. People at the top always claim that they are doing this for the good of the people, but humans? They act more like monkeys than civilized beings." Karl grunted in agreement as he poured out a glass of whiskey for each of them, both sipping it in an angry silence.

"It's only a few bad apples..." Culo tried to console himself, but Karl laughed. 

"A few bad apples? Looks like an entire orchard to me! I saw how they treated you today on the factory floor. No respect, no deference for the council that fought for their wages. They don't appreciate the sacrifice that we've put in to get to where we are today!"

"No, they do. Some even suffered at the hands of the Seven Snakes, experimented on."

"Yet I don't see any of them doing badly now? No one died during the prison escape, as far as I can tell. Both you and I know that prison was more of thugs and petty criminals than valiant union workers who fought for the cause. All they are doing is riding our goodwill and tearing our reputation to shreds!"

"Maybe... but-"

"Culo, look. You're a great council member, a real standup guy, but are you really getting the respect you deserve? What did you come to Raktor for? I know you're a migrant, though I never really got the full story."

"I'm just here to earn money for my brother and village back home in Ocra, that's all."

"So am I, here just to earn money for my kid to have a better future, whether or not he's here with me or not. You and I, we're in the same boat here. Now tell me, is what you're doing now for your brother? Is being treated like trash and slaving away for other skivers to get the same paycheck as you really working out as you expected?"

"It's not, but as a council member, I have to uphold the morals of the union-"

"The union is made up of people first and foremost. If no one respect the morals, what value does it have over anyone?" Karl gestured frantically, agitated. "I tell you this for your own sake, I know exactly what you're thinking deep down. You might be afraid to say it, but I'm not - the reason why you are angry, is because you're putting in the same, if not more work than others, YET they are getting paid the same. What happened to fairness? Equality? Unity?"

Culo had nothing to say, Karl having hit the nail right on the head. He thought about his brother again, wondering what the fuck was he playing at again. He was supposed to earn money, not act like a shepard for clearly reluctant workers. "You're fucking right, no one respects me at all. What the fuck am I even doing with my life?"

"You fought for an ideal, a dream. That's great and all, and you achieved it. But it's clear that the same dream and ideal isn't shared by others. Are you sure that the council is even aligned on the same dream when they aren't even lifting a finger to stop this madness?"

Culo was far too infuriated to speak any longer, angry at both himself and the circumstances as he poured himself two additional shots of whiskey, downing them in quick succession. Karl did the same, drinking along with him quietly before breaking the silence a minute later. "Now, if you want respect, you want to really see where the real wealth lies, I may have a friend who knows a guy who knows a guy." Karl twirled a rakel coin between his fingers. 

"What do you mean?"

"I'm talking a night out -  at the pubs and casinos! If those damn fuckers are going to play about, you and I both deserve some good rest and relaxation."

Culo wondered when was the last time he really took a break. First it was the harrowing hours, then it was the non-stop late night planning for the union and heist, then it was the neverending council duties that seemed to go on forever, one problem after the other. That coupled with the loss of his family heirloom finally broke him. "You know what? You're right. But wouldn't the Seven Snakes stop us from going in? We're union."

"Ah, like I said. I'm an old timer around here - I was around when the Seven Snakes rose to power myself, may have even witnesses a few fights in person. I know my way around town."

"You're not going to do anything to me, are you?"

"What, you think I'm going to drug and kidnap a council member at the Seven Snakes, just when the tensions between the union and them have yet to fully subside? I must have a death wish."

"Fine, but I got no rakels on me. I sent most of it back home."

Karl slung his arms around Culo, clearly a little tipsy. "Don't worry, I'll cover you. My friend who knows a guy who knows a guy? He's a real one, he'll foot the bill for us if we ask nicely."

"I still got a council meeting later to attend... I-"

"Fuck. Them. What they going to talk about? You've spent your entire time here in Raktor worrying about others. It's time for you to relax."

Culo had his doubts, still wary from his ring being stolen, but the alcohol he had just drank was starting to creep in, giving him a false sense of confidence. "Alright, lead the way."

"Hell yes, lets party! Let me call a wagon real quick."

"Call a wagon? You're that rich?"

"I live alone, and frankly, child support ain't that expensive." Karl grinned as he tuned the arctech radio, speaking quickly while Culo poured himself another one. 

The wagon came fast to the house, a luxurious wagon with the emblem of the Seven Snakes plastered all over it, the driver getting out of the cab to open the door for them. Culo felt like an imposter, never having been met with such treatment before, though Karl seemed to take everything in stride. "Come on, I got VIP treatment."

"But why? You're just a foreman!"

"Lets just say it's clear where I spent most of my money." Karl winked as Culo hopped on, instantly greeted by plush velvet and a neatly arranged set of glasses, already prefilled with sparkling wine. Karl didn't hesitate, immediately toasting Culo as the wagon moved off, speeding through the nightlife. 

Soon, they arrived at their destination, somewhere Culo never expected to be: the basement of the shopping arcade. Arctech neon lights and carpeted floors made him and his shabby outfit feel out of place, while the atmosphere were filled with violent shouting and drinking games, Seven Snakes recruits cheering each other on to get wasted. 

The bouncer at the door took a glance at Culo and Karl, immediately bowing and allowing them to enter without any fuss at all. "What the hell was that?"

"I'm a longtime customer - they better treat me right." Karl adjusted his collar, grinning widely as he led Culo towards a VIP area, far away from the rowdy crowd in a nice little circular room, complete with a ambient glowing table along with the softest cushion and silk Culo had ever felt before. However, the decor was not what surprised him. Instead, it was the two other council members who were also there at the VIP table, already drinking happily away. 

"What are you two doing here?! Aren't you supposed to be at the meeting?" Culo exclaimed.

"Speak for yourself, you're here too." The other two laughed and toasted each other, clearly drunk. "What's with the long face? Come on, let's drink!"

Culo felt the entire scenario was weird, wondering what kind of trap he had fallen into himself, only to finally notice the man sitting at the very center of the VIP room. He spun around, grabbing Karl by the collar and glaring at him. "You! You're working with them! You set me up?!"

"Hey, everything I'm doing is for you - you know that! Nobody is going to hurt you, just hear them out."

"Yes, Culo Demitri. Sit down." The man motioned to a nearby space, intimidating Culo as his legs began to shiver, knowing just how powerful the man was. Culo glanced over to the two other council members, who seemed to not care at all about who the man was. 

"I got nothing to say to a slaver who has no regard for human life."

"And who is the one paying you double wages now? Me? Or the council? Because from what I'm hearing, I'm not the one screwing up your work now."

"You experimented on people!"

"The very same people who are currently wreaking havoc on your very room. I know, Culo. I know exactly how they are."

"Because you're no different."

"Am I now? Last I checked, the district was better off under me than you and your union. Your friends here clearly agree with me."

"What did you do to them?" Culo squinted. 

"HEY!" A drunk council member wagged his fingers at Culo angrily. "We can make our own decisions, thank you very much."

"I simply made them an offer they couldn't refuse. Now sit down, before I change my approach."

Culo glanced to the side, noticing a few Seven Snakes members already eyeing the entrance to the VIP room. He knew if he tried to leave now, he wouldn't make it out alive, so he resigned himself to his fate, sitting down next to the man. "And what could the boss of the Seven Snakes want with me? I'm just a factory worker."

"You're not just a factory worker. You're leaders of men, but it is clear to all of us that the men are falling short of expectations. Despite the freedom and leisure that you have afforded them, you have obtained none of that. No one listens to you at all, but I can change that."

Culo wasn't dumb, knowing what Kyle was getting it. "You want me to betray them, work for you in the union."

"Not work for me. Work with me. And I think you seem to be mixing up who is betraying who."

"Don't try to twist my words, I know exactly what is happening now."

"Do you now? And do you know why Gunther was suddenly so adamant about maintaining production? About making sure everything stays on track?"

"To keep his job. And ours. It's obvious. I know what you're doing, you're trying to turn me against him."

"And what has he done for you? Your work isn't any better, your stress is through the roof, and you're compensating the same wages as those leeches slacking out of sight."

"You were the one who made the job intolerable in the first place!"

"Would you not have done the same in my position, when faced with such a tall order? Don't lie to me, I know you three are clearly angry at those who are not pulling their weight. If they fail to deliver, you lose your job. Simple as that."

"We're not the ones losing money."

"Of course not, I am the one losing money. See? I'm here to support the union. I gave in to every demand you had without so much as a complaint, despite all your protesting and violence."

Culo tried to retort, but couldn't deny that Kyle did acquiesce to all of their requests wholeheartedly. It was the workers who failed him, not the Seven Snakes themselves. There was no one else to blame when they had managerial control of the factory now. 

"I hear you're in dire need of money. You have a brother and village to feed back home." Kyle scribbled a number on a piece of paper, handing it to Culo. "Work with me, and you get this percent for every rifle and armour you sell from the factory. The same offer as those two. "

Culo snatched the piece of paper, his eyes bulging at the number. He was not too intelligent, but the basic math he quickly hashed out made the money he could potentially earn beyond his wildest dreams. *If I have this money, the village, they would be secure for generations to come!* "But the union..."

"Karl, if you would." Kyle snapped his fingers, prompting Karl to bring forward a prepared handheld light-thrower. "Have you ever wondered where Gunther disappears to during the day? How he and his other men are always gathering around the loading bay?"

"It's to make sure that the weapons and armour are properly stored away to deliver to Count Leon. We were warned that the Seven Snakes would try to steal them."

"Well then, see for yourself." Kyle smirked as he leaned back into the couch, enjoying his drink slowly while Culo stared in horror at what was playing out, watching Gunther personally transfer the crates to a Red Lion member in another district. 

"Gunther! No! This can't be real, this is fake! You fabricated this!"

"Just like how he fabricated all the executions."

"Those were real!" Culo asserted, causing Kyle to laugh. 

"Since you're so adamant about me being a slaver who experiments on others, what makes you think I would kill my own residents so wantonly?! I have much more use for their lives than to string their corpses around publicly. Don't you see? Your union leader is the one stringing you along!"

The other two council members were already sobering up after watching Gunther and his men delivering the crates day after day, the equipment they had worked so hard to produce now sold to a gang. "If he's giving them away to the Red Lions, there is no chance in hell we'll meet the deadline!"

Culo slumped into the couch, defeated. In just a single week, everything he thought to be true and ideal was smashed to pieces. Not even the union leader that he had trusted so much lived up to the dream that he had in his mind. 

"Respect. Money. Power. All of it can be yours. I'm not here to crush the union, I'm here to help you. Now, are you with me? Or against me?"

# Chapter 89 - The Mole

*A week later...*

In the wee hours of the morning, the office of the shopping arcade was quiet, the myraid of office tables left unkept, dozens of paper documents stacked high with pens scattered about. In the midst of all this bureaucracy, a lone man dug through the drawers, searching through Keith's desk intently. 

"Come on, come on..." The man grunted as he flipped through hundreds of documents frantically, trying to find something. Words and numbers washed over him while his eyes flickered to and fro, reading as quickly as he could before he finally spotted something irregular. "What the fuck?!" He rubbed his eyes, unable to believe what he was reading. 

Suddenly, he heard a clinking sound, a metal key rattling in the locked door of the office. "Fucking shit, who's coming in to work this early? Are they crazy?" Still, complaining was not going to help him. The man hurriedly arranged everything back in order the way it was, before scrambling for a hiding spot. 

Soon, the door opened to reveal a groggy Keith, who had just barely woken up, though he heard a dull thud coming from the rows of tables. "Hello? Who's there? Is that you, Lucetta? You know we don't pay for overtime."

Nothing responded, the office as quiet as ever, Keith squinting in suspicion as he began to carefully walk through the office, scanning every table. 

Behind an office cabinet, the man cowered in fear, clutching his mouth and nose tightly to prevent his breathing from being heard. He heard the footsteps come closer and closer, until Keith's boots were clearly visible from the corner of his eyes. He steeled himself, preparing to come out swinging until the arctech radio on Keith's table blurted out static, distracting Keith. 

Keith hurried over, picking up the radio. "Yes? Yes, of course. Understood. I'll have all the cobras and vipers gathered within the hour for the capture of Gunther. I'll ensure the union council is in position."

*Capture of Gunther?! Fuck, the gig is up!* The man's heart skipped a beat, but he remained calm, not moving a single inch while Keith continued chatting on the radio, leaving the office. The man who was stealing secrets from Keith's office knew very well what would happen if Gunther were to be caught - he would be next in line without a doubt. 

The moment the main doors of the office slammed shut behind Keith, the man leapt into action, grabbing as many documents as possible of the Seven Snakes and stuffing them into his pants, shirt and wherever else he could hide them. He quickly ran over to the door, opening it just an inch and peeking, noticing that the hallway outside the office was empty, Keith nowhere to be seen.

Not giving up the opportunity to leave, he walked out of the office, scampering back towards his own office, quickly packing all of his things. He fumbled with a lockbox, opening it to reveal an arctech radio of his own, quickly calling the other pair. "Gunther, Gunther!"

[What? What's wrong?]

"The Seven Snakes are out to capture you, and most likely I've been made as well!"

[What do you mean? How are they going to capture me?]

"They have infiltrated the union council itself! I suspect some of the members have turned against us."

[I can't leave yet, the weapons meant for our brothers and the revolution is not ready]

"If you don't leave now, there will be no revolution, idiot! We need to leave, now!"

"Guang Hwa?" A voice suddenly interrupted the conversation, Keith knocking on the door of the man's office. 

Guang Hwa panicked, stuffing the radio back into the lockbox and slamming it shut, before hiding all of his packed belongings. "Keith? Please, come in."

Keith entered, seeing nothing different about the office, save for Guang Hwa sweating with a pained smile on his face. "Why are you sitting in the dark?"

"Uh... well... I heard it helps improve my vision. You know, to see better at night."

"What, you trying to be a night owl now? Nevermind that, I need you in the meeting room in an hour."

"Of course, of course, I'll be there." Guang Hwa gave a thumbs up, before acting like he was reading a document intently, Keith closing the door. The moment the door closed, Guang Hwa resumed his packing, stuffing a handgun, the radio and all of the stolen documents into a small briefcase, before arranging his outfit properly. 

He waltzed out of the office with confidence, walking with purpose while the clerks and other adminstrative staff nodded and bowed to him, not caring about where he was going. As soon he was clear of the shopping arcade however, he suddenly ran right into the towering Damian just around a corner, nearly smacking into his chest directly. 

"Oh, sorry, didn't see you there. Where are you going anyway? There's a meeting in an hour."

"I heard there's a issue at the new apartments being built near the complex. I'm going to have a quick look and I'll be back for the meeting."

"Alright, I'll have Niko arrange an escort for you. We can't risk any of our higher-ups getting lynched by the union now."

"No, no don't bother. The site is really close, just over there. And I'm a Seven Snakes too, I can handle myself."

Damian glanced at the lanky Guang Hwa, examining his scrawny body. "Right..."

"Anyway, if I don't leave now, I'll be late - no time to arrange the escort. See you later, big guy." Guang Hwa smacked Damian's biceps that felt like steel, before quickly walking off. 

Once he was clear of the shopping arcade, his direction changed immediately. *Fallback point is towards the Magda...* He followed the escape plan concoted between him and Gunther, moving quickly through the street, melding into the thousands of workers who were now leaving or entering the factory in droves. 

He moved carefully, acting as part of the crowd and blending in, following the tide of people that were heading to work. However, not many were heading towards the enforcers' district, instead having jobs at the various Seven Snakes establishment. As such, the crowd around Guang Hwa began to dwindle as he turned street after street. *Almost there, almost there...*

Suddenly, as he turned the corner, his eyes widened as he frantically backpedalled into cover, noticing Niko stationed with three squads of Seven Snakes. "Make sure no union worker gets past this. Once the operation start, people are going to start running, and I want every single suspicious person caught!"

*Damn it!* Guang Hwa tried to peek around the corner, looking for a way around. However, the Seven Snakes were long experienced with locking down the district, each and every backlane now cut off by the guards who formed a tight net. 

His mind raced as he slowed down, hurriedly acting like a local resident, moving with the flow of people back towards the center of the district. Finding a nook in a nearby damaged shop, he quickly entered and hid among the half broken shelves, tuning the radio once more to a different number. "Red Lions? Red Lions?"

[And to whom am I speaking to?]

"It's Guang Hwa. I need your help to get out of the district. The Seven Snakes, they are onto me!"

The person on the other line remained silent, Guang Hwa's heart palpitating as he watched a Seven Snakes patrol move past him as he ducked. 

[And why is the CEO of the Golden Snakes running?]

"Cut the bullshit, Wrent. I have information, critical information on how the Seven Snakes operate, locations of all their secret hideouts and labs. If you want it, you need to help me!"

[Hmm.... fine. Meet at Southcross Road, make sure you aren't followed. Find the sign of the red jug and wait there.]

"What do you mean, wait there?!" Guang Hwa whispered angrily, but the radio had already went silent.

"Hey, who's in that shop?"

*Shit!* Guang Hwa kept quiet as a mouse, holding his breath as a Seven Snakes patrol team peered into the damaged storefront. 

"Come on, Ollie, stop messing around. You just want an excuse to try on a woman's dress, right?" Another patrol member nudged Ollie in the ribs. 

"Stop messing around, you two. Today is fucking important, you hear me?"

"When are you going to stop acting like our dad, Alex?"

"It's Cobra Alex to you!"

While the patrol team was bickering, Guang Hwa quickly moved through the debris, clambering over a half collapsed doorway and slinking through the gaps, before reaching a back entrance. He closed his eyes tight as he ditched his formal outfit, changing them for one of rags stained with grease and snot, clearly discarded by another homeless man. Clutching the briefcase tightly, he snuck his way around the streets, making it towards the Red Lions meeting point, continuously glancing behind him to make sure he was not followed. 

Soon, he made it to the destination, a old rusty building with a half-broken sign of a jug, dashed with blood. No one seemed to have occupied it in what seemed like ages. He quickly entered into its depths, finding a staircase that led downwards to a cellar. To his surprise, the cellar was surprisingly well-stocked, filled to the brim with supplies and maps that seemed to be the result of observations gathering intelligence on the Seven Snakes. 

Guang Hwa ran his finger across some of the maps, noting a few variations of an attack plan on the Seven Snakes, a three prong strike launched from the various Red Lion districts. A grin came to his face, knowing that his salvation was close at hand. *That's what you fucking get for enslaving me, bitch.*

Thankfully, he was confident that he was far out of range of the slave engraving being able to affect him. All he needed to do was to find a black market engraver who could break the connection, though it would be hard to find someone trustworthy. Many escaped slaves instead found themselves transferred to another master, entering the slave market anew or auctioned off again. 

Guang Hwa continued to examine the cellar, noticing a locked door at the far end, arctech engravings inscribed all along its surface. Just as he averted his gaze, the engravings glowed, opening to reveal Wrent and five of his Red Lion followers. 

"Thank the goddess - Seven Snakes are going to bust the union apart, they want to capture Gunther!" Guang Hwa explained, but Wrent yawned, clearly not interested in what he had to say, instead holding out his hand expectantly. 

Guang Hwa gritted his teeth, taking out a single secret document and tossing it over to Wrent, who caught it nimbly. He flipped through the document, a small grin spreading across his face. "Interesting. So the way the Seven Snakes are footing the bill is because of the new drug. Workers buy the drug with their wages, and the money circulates right back into the Seven Snakes treasury. But I don't suppose this is the only information you have?"

"You only get the rest when you get me the fuck out of here." Guang Hwa eyed the entrance from which Wrent and his men came through, noticing it was a tunnel of sorts that clearly led out of the district.

Wrent thought for a brief moment, before motioning to his men. "Check the street, make sure no one is following us."

"What the fuck are you waiting for? Let's get out!" Guang Hwa urged, only for Wrent to draw his blade. 

"Oh don't think I'm stupid, Guang Hwa. I've heard all about your 'deals' with the black market. Everyone knows you're the one who sold the degraded engravings. For all I know, this could be another trap by that accursed Kyle."

"You fucking idiot, I'm not with them, I'm a slave!"

Wrent ignored the pleas of Guang Hwa, instead waiting for his men to confirm the absence of an ambush. One of his men climbed up the staircase, peeking his head out to see the street level empty, devoid of residents. "Sir, no one is around."

"Not a single soul?"

"Yes, sir, I don't even see any worker-GUH!" The Red Lion's head was gripped tightly, before his entire body was flung out into the open, Damian charging right into the cellar with a tower shield in his right arm. With a roar, he slammed into the next Red Lion, bashing the man into the wall violently before using the long edge of the shield to knock the Red Lion out. 

"Damn it!" Wrent gritted his teeth, drawing his engraved sword, the remaining three Red Lions wielding rifles and firing right at Damian. "Flank his shield!"

They fan out across the cellar as Damian took cover behind the shield, Guang Hwa cowering on the floor and scrambling past to the entrance in the hopes of safety. However, before Guang Hwa could make it, Wrent gripped his collar and flung him to the corner. "You're not going anywhere you fucking cunt!"

"Better pay attention!" Damian grinned as he rushed the nearest Red Lion, using the shield to crush him head-on. However, the other two Red Lions quickly captialized on the opportunity, shooting at Damian's exposed back. 

Instead of the pellets biting into the flesh, they pinged off his body like his skin was made of metal, the Red Lions flabbergasted while Damian now switch targets, surprisingly agile for his large body. With a rapid successions of hits, the remaining two Red Lions were knocked out as well, concussed from the heavy blows rained down upon them.

Suddenly, alarm bells rang in Damian's head as he hurriedly brought his shield to bear, a red gushing energy wave slicing right at him and sending him sprawling backwards, breaking apart tables and chairs. 

"Damian, little boy. Look how you've grown up. But you're not the only fucker improving!" Wrent roared as he unleashed another two waves of energy, his engraved sword slashing violently and pushing Damian back. His tower shield suffered brunt after brunt as Damian dug his feet into the cellar's floor, bracing himself against the broken wooden furniture. 

"Oh I'm grown up enough now. I used to see you as a wall - but now I know you're just as weak as anyone else!" Damian grabbed a dropped Red Lion rifle, firing at Wrent only for the pellets to be deflected by point defense arcia bolts lancing outwards. 

"Don't think your armor is unique!" Wrent lunged at Damian, slashing downwards at close range, the tower shield creaking under the impact as Damian's feet drove deeper into the ground. Damian quickly rolled out of the way, using the shield to deflect each of the incoming strikes. 

Without a word, Damian fired all the pellets in the rifle, squeezing the trigger hard and trying to overwhelm the point defense. Sure enough, the breastplate of Wrent's armour began to falter, the pellets about to burst through the plates only for a glittering energy shield to appear out of nowhere. 

"Surprised? Courtesy of the Ilysian Punks' stash!" Wrent yelled as he went on the offensive again, his confidence buoyed by the protective Galactic Era personal shield while delivering a brutal combo. The blade of the sword found an opening, cutting deep into Damian's arm and exposing the bone, blood leaking outwards. "Better tell your boss to come save you, else there won't be much left!"

"You don't understand - we knew all along we were going to fight you." Damian gritted his teeth as his arms reveberated from blocking another blow. 

"And they chose you? HAH!" Wrent lifted the sword high.

"Because I'm enough." Damian spoke quietly while he rapidly rolled out of the way, Wrent losing his balance as the downward slashed missed entirely, hitting thin air. Before Wrent could recover his posture, the edge of the tower shield slammed from his right toward his legs, the personal shield flickering wildly from the physical impact. 

Wrent hurriedly swung the sword to the right, deflecting the tower shield on Damian's left arm upwards, exposing his body. "You're dead!" Wrent reversed his wrist as he aimed right at Damian's neck, slashing downwards. Instead of seeing a shocked Damian, Wrent could only watch as the right fist of Damian shot towards his face, breaking through the personal shield and landing squarely on his jaw. The force of the impact instantly cracked three of Wrent's teeth, before sending him tumbling into a dust cloud of broken furniture, a nearby cupboard collapsing onto Wrent. 

"RAGH! It's not ovah!" Wrent roared with blood spurting out of his broken jaw, using the sword to slash his way out of the debris, forcing Damian to block the ensuing energy slash. Wrent hurriedly checked his shield, noticing the relic's gauge was depleted. He glanced around the cellar, noticing that Guang Hwa was already missing, having clearly escaped before him. "GRRR!"

Wrent unleashed his fury, throwing five rapid slashes and blasting Damian back, before diving into the exit of the cellar, closing the door behind him and channeling arcia energy into the engraving, sealing it. "GUWANG HWWA! You fucking rat!" Wrent limped as blood trickled down from his mouth, his gum bleeding profusely as he fumbled with a healing flask on his belt, quickly drinking it. The wounds began to close up, restoring his health, but the humiliation at Damian's hand still remained. 

*Fucking, how could I lose to that pathetic excuse of a kid! Even Ulon used to be weaker than me!* Wrent boiled with rage as he sprinted down the tunnel, knowing Guang Hwa was right ahead. He took solace in the fact that Damian was the underboss of the Seven Snakes. Beating Kyle might be currently out of reach, but at least he still stood a chance against their second strongest. 

As he reached the end of the tunnel, he finally spotted the visage of Guang Hwa, banging on the exit and obviously failing to open the door. 

"Idiot, you can't open the door if you're not a Red Lion!" Wrent grunted, grabbing Guang Hwa from behind and slamming him against the wall, the blade of his sword biting into his neck. "Now give me one very fucking good reason why I do not LOB YOUR HEAD OFF RIGHT NOW!"

"I didn't know I was tracked, I swear! Look, have everything on me! You gotta believe me, I'm not with them!" Guang Hwa hurriedly pointed his briefcase. "I was the insider helping out Gunther take over the factory."

Wrent held the sword against Guang Hwa's neck as he bent down to open the briefcase, seeing an entire stack full of financial documents and logistic routes. Wrent thumbed through a few, realizing that Guang Hwa was telling the truth - some of the information corroborated with his own information gathering so far.

"See? It's not my fault!"

"Fuck you." Wrent kicked Guang Hwa in the shin, causing him to collapse while continuing to browse the documents. Wrent's eyes grew wider and wider as he read each document amdist the unnerving silence of the tunnel only interspersed with Guang Hwa's whimpering. "You fucking idiot, did you read any of this information?"

"What..?" Guang Hwa replied painfully. "I just got my hands on it right before I left!"

"Bitch, they were already onto you from two weeks ago! They were tracking you from the very beginning!"

"Fucking... Now's not the time to bicker about who's following me, only that I've made good my bargain, so now you have to save me!"

"Oh yea? Now that I have all your information, what good are you to me?"

"I gave you everything!"

"Yea, a boatload of pain and trouble. We both know how the underworld works." Wrent raised his sword, Guang Hwa scrambling to find a reason to stay alive.

"I...I can set you up with the rest of the union! Gunther and his men must have made it out now with the weapons and designs."

"Designs?"

"Yes, the design for the armour, so you can make it yourself too."

"Interesting... fine. It looks like you are still valuable. But cross me again and I'll make sure this sword rips your body in half." Wrent sighed, packing the documents back into the briefcase before approaching the exit door. He placed his hand on the surface of the door, channeling arcia and unlocking it. However, Wrent could already feel something was off, not opening the door just yet. 

"What's wrong? Let's go already!" 

"It's too quiet. My men would have asked for the passcode by now."

"Fuck! Give me a weapon!" Guang Hwa urged.

"Like fucking hell I will." Wrent wasn't about to risk the chance, so Guang Hwa looked around frantically, before picking up a loose rock, hoping and praying to the Goddess as well as any other divine beings beyond his understanding it would be enough to defend him. 

Gripping the handle of his sword tightly, Wrent flung the door open, preparing to slash downwards only see the glint of a dazzling blade striking right towards, nearly nailing him right in the neck as Wrent instinctually parried with the hilt. The force of the lunge sent him toppling, Wrent recovering quickly before noticing a woman with blood splattered across her outfit and face. "Who the fuck are you?!"

Instead of hearing a response, Wrent only heard Guang Hwa's panicked footsteps sprinting down the tunnel back the entrance fleeing for his life, leaving Wrent to fend for himself. 

The woman merely cocked her head sideways as she kicked aside the mutilated body of a Red Lion member, surprisingly still breathing and moaning. Wrent roared as he charged forward bravely, only for all of his strikes to be parried easily by the woman, each step pristine like a dance. The woman had a bored expression on her face, almost yawning while Wrent gave it his all, slashing and throwing energy wave after wave. 

"Fuck!" Wrent shot forth an energy wave, the woman suddenly slashing her sword perpendicular to the wave, dissipating it right through the middle as the two halves of the wave smashed into the wall behind, a dust cloud erupting from the impact.

Before Wrent could launch another combo, he suddenly felt a burning sensation carved right through his fingers, his grip on his sword lost as it went sailing through the air, clattering onto the blood-stained ground. Wrent collapsed to his knees, fighting back the urge to scream from the loss of his fingers.

As the woman slowly approached him, a primordial fear began to seep into Wrent's heart as he involuntarily scrambled backwards, half of him suddenly wondering if Damian was not even the second strongest in the Seven Snakes.
